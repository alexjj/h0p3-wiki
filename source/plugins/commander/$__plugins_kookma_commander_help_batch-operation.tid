Making the same changes to large numbers of tiddlers in TW5 can be repetetive and time consuming.

* Batch operations work on groups of tiddlers at the same time and make changes 'in bulk', in one go.

* Batch operations operate on groups of tiddlers that share matching criteria.

* Tiddlers which share  a common tag, a common field, a word in their title, or were  created on the same day, month or year are all candidates for batch operations.

As a result batch operations can save users a great deal of time but, because they work on several tiddlers at once, the price of a mistake is multiplied! Back-up your wiki!

!! Types of Batch operations :
# Rename tiddlers
#* use  a totally new name
#* add a suffix/prefix to title
#* add prefix to title
#* replace part of title
#* add ordinal number to title 
#* Copy tiddlers (make duplicates)
# Add/remove tag or any field
# Change/replace the content of any field
# Create multiple empty tiddlers (for lectures or a slideshow) with common properties (tag, field, part of text,...)
# Capability to undo an operation at least one step back
# Capability to get user confirmation before doing an operation
