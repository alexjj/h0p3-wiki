title: 2020.09.21 - Wiki Review: No Beautiful Basement

* [[2020.09.20 - Family Log: Late]]
** Not done. =/. Okay.
* [[2020.09.20 - Wiki Review: Trying To Chill]]
** Completed. Ah, but I would live without my digital [[monster]]. I think I could adjust back, though poorly. I know I would need way, way more paper though. 
*** A surprising amount of the method I use in this wiki could be transferred into books. But, it wouldn't be even remotely as useful (search is simply too critical; it's an entirely different beast by hand).
* [[2020.09.20 - TDL: On Advice Of My Life]]
** I'm not going to be able to respond to all those quotes. That is a lot of [[Antipleonasm Analysis]]. I'm really glad to at least think about them though. Fascinating.
* [[2020.09.20 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Family]]
** Welp, unfortunately, I won't have that gorgeous basement. It was great to {[[dream]]} about though.
*** At least we can consider more rural areas. I would like that.
* [[2020.09.20 - Prompted Introspection: A Pet]]
** I already worry about the day that Chairman Meow or Ranga might leave our lives. I don't know how [[k0sh3k]] is going to handle it. It's going to be ugly.
* [[2020.09.17 - Prompted Introspection: Need]]
** Classic. I do have stronger opinions than this. It's a keeper of a question.
