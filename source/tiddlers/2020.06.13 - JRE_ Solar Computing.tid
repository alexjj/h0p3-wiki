Cute AF =)

You should grow a mullet to match. This may be your only opportunity.

I have a request. If you have time, would you find+recommend a solar panel + battery set up for a single laptop?
Jun 13 9:32pm
How mobile?
Jun 13 9:35pm
Worthy of nomadic camping
Jun 13 9:35pm
So could be vehicle mounted?  Or can be carried long distance?
Jun 13 9:38pm
Big problem will be battery weight, but in vehicle, no biggy
Jun 13 9:38pm

I'd prefer it something I could arbitrarily mount/dismount, not vehicle dependent. This may not be possible. I have no idea.
Jun 13 9:39pm
Well, most panels are going to take effort to mount to a car, although it's getting more vehicle specific with stealth campers
Jun 13 9:40pm
So the problem isn't that you would have a panel/battery that is uncountable outside of a vehicle, it's about how much battery life and uptime you could sustain with batteries small enough to carry
Jun 13 9:42pm
Unmountable*
Jun 13 9:42pm
I suppose I could try to slim down the battery usage in a radical way
Jun 13 9:43pm
The RPi would be enough computer power
Jun 13 9:43pm
So either you charge a battery, think car battery (s), and gotta lug that around, and from that you can charge and run lots of things, or you can carry extra laptop batteries and find a way to charge multiples so you always have some ready
Jun 13 9:45pm
I prefer the former.
Jun 13 9:46pm
Can you tell me the wattage on the laptop?
Jun 13 9:46pm
No idea.
Jun 13 9:46pm
I'm willing to change that up significantly
Jun 13 9:46pm
Hypothetical laptop?
Jun 13 9:46pm
Gotcha, I have no clue what real averages are, but I'll check out stuff
Jun 13 9:47pm
Computer going to be on constantly, or shut down sometimes?
Jun 13 9:51pm
Prefer on permanently, but will work with whatever is the butterzone
Jun 13 9:51pm
Day 2 of fever for kid.  Sad pupper

Jun 13 10:29pm
Walking with him now
Jun 13 10:29pm
He's up late.
Jun 13 10:29pm
Can't sleep?
Jun 13 10:29pm
Keeps waking up
Jun 13 10:30pm
Computer needs 12v DC, uses power supply as rectifier to change 120v ac into 12v dc.
Jun 13 10:31pm
Most solar panels are going to go to a voltage controller that will spit put 12v DC, so it is actually better if we can safely hook computer up directly to splar
Jun 13 10:32pm
Solar
Jun 13 10:32pm
Spit out
Jun 13 10:33pm
One hand type
Jun 13 10:33pm
Cause solar panel loses some power when it uses inverter to change 12v DC into 120ac, and power supply loses some power when it changes 120v ac back into 12v dc
Jun 13 10:34pm
So camper set ups, with inverters, could be avoided, as long as you are only using setup for pc, not mini fridge or other ac load
Jun 13 10:35pm
Just for laptops would be fine.
