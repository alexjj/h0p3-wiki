title: 2020.08.04 - chameleon: Wage Slave Time

"""
[5:01 PM] h0p3: `/salute`. I wish you luck at FNM!
[5:16 PM] chameleon: `^^`
[5:17 PM] chameleon: Thanks!
[5:17 PM] h0p3: Whatcha playing?
[5:17 PM] chameleon: Last week I scrubbed out hard so let's hope this week is better
[5:21 PM] h0p3: Yes, ma'am. May your opponents mull to 5 all day.
[5:22 PM] h0p3: I bet it is extra fun to play with your hubby. Shittalking and banter get hardcore then.
[5:22 PM] h0p3: Even high stakes betting, lol.
[5:23 PM] h0p3: When I was teaching high school, one of my seniors came to play, and I told him if he dropped Goblin Sharpshooter I was going to fail him in my class. Of course he did.

[1:46 AM] chameleon: followups: sent
knuckles: cracked
yep, it's wage slave time :wink:
[1:46 AM] chameleon: they said they'd followup in a week
[1:47 AM] chameleon: so... optimistic. Excited. It's not a sure thing yet. but every time I've done that well in an interview I've gotten offered the position
[1:47 AM] h0p3: It's time to prepare for bypassing their surveillance and effortlessly hiding your real work.
[1:48 AM] chameleon: indeed!
[1:48 AM] chameleon: of course, the job itself looks exciting. great stuff
[1:48 AM] h0p3: I'm glad that it's C.
[1:48 AM] h0p3: Can't be too boring.
[1:48 AM] chameleon: as am I. I've been really wanting to get paid for that for a while. With any luck I can build a C career out of it
[1:49 AM] chameleon: despite what the rust folx would have us believe, C will be here to stay for a while
[1:50 AM] h0p3: I agree. I don't think it will disappear. The older rustaceans I've met also don't think C in the world will, can, or should be fully replaced. Seems like good job security to me.
[1:51 AM] chameleon: and hey, I don't want to be writing java until I retire either :wink:
