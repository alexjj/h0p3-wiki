** I've asked to host him. So many conversations I've lost with this man over the years. I want him to have a voice, even if I just proxy for him.
** I love him. Told him too.
* Talked with [[JRE]]

** Discussion of Harris vs. Peterson, and the mod, histories and philosophies. 
*** Nominalism and Subjectivity
** Talking about [[Sphygmus]]' movie recommendations.
*** They are some of my brother's favorites lately; I don't remember. He's glad I'm watching them (he is annoyed that I have not taken his advice sooner, understandably).
*** He described a scene in [[Midsommar]] that made me cry.
** He's still sounds surprised that I cry more in the past few years than he saw as a child. I don't understand why.
