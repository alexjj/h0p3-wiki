title: 2020.12.23 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Nightmares

* Woke at 1:30
* Fireman Time!
* Melon, pie, coffee
* Try To Take Over The World
* Sleep at 7?
* Woke at Noon
** Horrifying nightmares. I couldn't escape. I watched a massacre in two separate dreams. Mostly drowning children. I couldn't escape the dream into waking life. My whole body is sore now, especially my arms and stomach.
* Offspring sent to task (morning was not good)
* Ravioli, water
* [[MTG]]
** Wife's Delver vs Infect: begged her to hit my creatures (walked through the protection), but she wasn't all there I think (something else on the brain, her book?...that aint no christ figure). Mull. She thirsted for blood (while I missed my second land drop), took me down to 1, but I alpha-striked like a []D[][]V[][]D. Could have been prevented in 5 different ways to my count.
* The Weld
** Son prepared the area well (and with little description of why). Flying hot metal shards and dripping liquid metal were were all set to be captured by his boxing. Protected his room well for this.
** Dialecture, thought about the stages, walked through safety, talked more about the differences in the tools.
** Been a while since I held a grinder in my hands, but it feels like riding a bike. I'd carve my heart out with it. Smelled so good.  
** Went stick first. Could not fucking get a spark. This machine is not a great one (literally the cheapest possible). Did my due diligence on the ground connection and it finally lit up.
*** Unfortunately, my old mask needs a new battery. That means my son couldn't watch (need 10, not 9 shade), and, more problematically for such a difficult weld: I lack the autodarken (ugh, I'm so reliant on that for clean strikes and a good root). I miss the shop and quarter inch carbon steel.
**** Wasn't much to see anyway. Ugly. Hated it.
*** I could get a spotweld, but the metal was even thinner than I thought it would be. Ugh. A hole even on very low amperage, but no consistent arc regardless of heat. Look at the rest of the structure, and you can see they flux or mig (I should have just gone with that; it's not industrial steel).
*** Clean it up. Could have stopped, but might as well make it better.
** Son and I set up the flux welder (I've found wire feeds a huge pain in my ass, but this was sane for absolute budget). 
*** He was able to watch, but he had no idea what he was looking at. I really need a shop to teach this part. He was a good sport.
*** I'm glad to have so much space in his room.
*** Right tool for the job felt better.
** Do I still hate it? Yes. Will it hold my fat ass? Yes. Okay.
* Try To Take Over The World
* Fireman Time!
* Installed lock on bathroom. 
** Makes no sense to me, but I don't care. I'm still going to watch you pee. I could not be more envious of a toilet. 
* [[MTG]]
** Daughter's Affinity vs Timmy +3, +1: Pemmin's pwns. Sigil hax on MoE, eventually didn't need the tempo and alphastriked.
* [[JRE]] Called otw to pick up Mexican
** He's feeling extra depressed. Gonna drop the meds for another set. Makes sense. He has such a strong understanding of his own mental states (better than mine). 
** Rebecca, Blink, Disgust, Mooning, In-Law VC
** My sexual failures, lol. My boy knows how to laugh with me.
** Dim returns on working on the house
* Called [[AIR]]
* My Room
** Offspring begrudgingly and with much weeping and gnashing of teeth decided to help their old man with his pile. 
** Daughter's old monitor is not in use, and it's just perfect for a vertical. The special stand was not in good shape, but it was possible to fix it up to stand right. Time to test it out. [[Some|Tapeda the Dragon]] seem to [[swear|gwern]] by it. 
** So much space, so much to sort through and tidy. Micro work in everyone's rooms. 
* //Skintime// -> Assisted Fireman Time
* Prevented from meditating, my presence was necessary, someone longed for my conversation skills.
** Her head is fucking killing her. Storm is coming in. She might be right about her stress hypothesis. She did not take it as easy as she could have, but still: she had tons of freedom. 
* Try To Take Over The World
