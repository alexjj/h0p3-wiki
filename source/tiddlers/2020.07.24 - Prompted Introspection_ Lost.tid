title: 2020.07.24 - Prompted Introspection: Lost

!! What historical figure, individual, archetype, or group do you identify with?

[[2017.05.22 - Prompted Introspection Log]] and [[2019.08.25 - Prompted Introspection: Assonance]] flesh out the superlative well enough. There's plenty to mine in a tweaked version of this question. I am, of course, struck by [[Identifying With: Fictional Characters]]. I think this question reminds me of mimetics and the categorical overlapping necessary for Spinozan essence. What parts of our selves pick out the roughly identical parts in [[others]] or to [[W5H]] do we belong in the universal domain? It's a mirror foothold in the search for who we are (and who we ought to be).

I identify with people who feel lost and know it. We can say that's simply everyone, but I don't think most people have any idea how lost we are, lol. I also think some paths in the desert are wiser than others. I identify with those aiming to be wise (even when I think they aren't wise otherwise).
