title: 2022.09.02 - That's for you to decide: DHT Crowd

"""
[15:44:33] [[h0p3]]: Hello. I'm wondering if you might be able to help me find people to speak with about DHT design. The Tox community is more well-versed in real-world DHT usage than most, imho. I was hoping to brainstorm with folks about it, but I don't know many people who have the knowledge and desire for such a thing. If you happen to know or run across individuals that might be interested, please send me their way or them my way.
[15:48:14] [[That's for you to decide]]: Hey, I've no idea who knows about DHT well enough from the tox community but you could drop a message on irc in #toktok
[15:48:52] [[h0p3]]: That is a good idea. I didn't want to pollute the discussion. 
[15:49:08] [[That's for you to decide]]: > [22:48:38] h0p3(darkmx): That is a good idea. I didn't want to pollute the discussion. 
There is a general lack of discussion xD
[15:49:17] [[h0p3]]: Yeah. Hehe.
[15:49:22] [[That's for you to decide]]: But people reply so you should be fine.
[15:49:42] [[h0p3]]: #toktok:libera.chat is the bridge, yeah?
[15:50:13] [[That's for you to decide]]: I made a user named TokTok for the bridge to ngc, if that's what you're asking.
[15:50:58] [[h0p3]]: Thank you.
[15:51:50] [[That's for you to decide]]: You're welcome. People should reply soon enough since it's going to be the weekend now.
