My parasocial relationships a decade from now will boil down to scraping their data, using that corpus to construct a model (set aside for a moment the number of attacks this may unleash on us all, even just to find the magic words to say to someone), and generating thousands of nudes plus a wonderful chatbot to revolve around my every need. It's gonna be unreal, yo.

Part of eliminating the delusions within parasociality is recognizing how when we learn more about a stranger, we must work to dispel the feelings that they know us better too, which is too easily conflated with the likely more accurate claim that we learn they could possibly know us in a way we want others to know us.

When no one (including ourselves) understands our story, we are alone.

Someone who is quiet enough in the right places can mask their shallowness pretty effectively. With time, it's often revealed. Just keep handing them them slack as they run from committing to anything but themselves. They feel they need to be wanted and want to not need anyone. Let them go or give them the way out. Make it a learning opportunity. The covert narcissist who thinks they are on an inner quest to find who they really are is much closer to a hollow ghost than they will admit. Show it to them in the mirror of masks.
