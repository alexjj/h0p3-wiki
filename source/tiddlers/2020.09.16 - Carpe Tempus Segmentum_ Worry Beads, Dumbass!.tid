title: 2020.09.16 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Worry Beads, Dumbass!

* Woke at 1:30
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Walked to the library with offspring
** My phone was off, thought it may be dead. Can't get books without calling. Lucky.
** I like their book choices. I'm not reading anything that sad ever fucking again though. Weirdos. The good cop helped them choose wisely.
** Thought about their schoolwork. I'll take it.
** Considered getting some Chinese, but then we saw the prices. Jesus. Nope.
** A lot of businesses have disappeared. I've just not been paying enough attention. 
** Talked about everything. I don't remember everything.
* Made lunch for us
* Prep
* Shower
* Read+Write
* Daughter and I discussed her activities. She's used a lot of methods to get back on Discord, lol. Straight-up addicted. 
** I'm trying not to give too many hints, and I'm trying not to hear more than I should. She's picking all the low-hanging fruit first. So many cool places to go.
* Encouraged getting their wikis done...again. Of course. It will never. I will never stfu. I am the worst.
* Vapelyfe
* I was honored to speak with so many people today, beyond my predictions.
* //The Walk//
** Many gorgeous asses today. Jiggle. Bounce. 
** I actually went first in talking about my day. 
** Quieter than usual. 
** We met Howard and Ellen 
*** I remembered through a drawn out mnemonic erotic story based on celebrities. Anything to make her squirm. =) 
*** ~60, not sure where to place their appearance, thoughtful discussions as I've heard them pass, holding hands. 
*** We have encountered them many times on the trail (at least 9). Always the wave, the "hi." Most of the boomers are merely signaling. Their eyes don't lie though. You can see they are thinking. They even sounded honest, though I did not test. It was the other way around. 
*** Quiet humor in their bridge-building. They asked me about my beads. She knew what they were for. She called them worry beads. Hrm. Boy. I'm retarded.<<ref "b">> That's exactly what they are! Compulsively so too. Without saying much about the world, she seemed to know why. He commented that he often wants to go barefoot when he sees me, as it reminded him of his summers as a boy in NC (mandatory shoelessness).
*** I was perfectly awkward, and they didn't mind too much (they really, really don't know me -- <<tag "The Super Freaks">>).
*** After the very brief conversation ended, my wife noted my autistic rocking back and forth. She laughed. Apparently, I do that after every encounter. 
*** I must bring my cards with me. I keep failing to do so.
** SL is interested in having dinner with us. Cool. I'm super excited. I've heard so much about her. 
** I said something naughty enough to get pushed off the trail. A passerby noted her abuse with a smile.
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Stirfry, watermelon, coffee!
*** Offspring felt it was overcooked, but it was exactly the way I like it. I'm a heathen.
** They talked about school. We didn't have any time for [[Debatable]].
* Read+Write
* AFireman Time!
