I am capable. But I have realized my expectations for my own child are too hight. She hasn't reached my level of expectations.

Apr 3 9:33pm
Oh, lord, I have been there too. My daughter forgot and had to relearn them a bunch of times. It just didn't stick with her, infuriatingly so.

I expect 60-80% infected over the next year. From the regression models I have seen.
Apr 4 11:53am
Yup. The infection rate and even the deaths are the parts which worry me the most. It's poppin' some bubbles though. I think a lot of poor people are being sacrificed.
Apr 4 11:55am
