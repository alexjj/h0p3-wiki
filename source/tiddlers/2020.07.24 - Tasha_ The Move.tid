Sunday is going well enough for us. Family Time is expensive when they don't do their school work.

Mom got kicked out ðŸ™„ dude she was here for 7 weeks and though I love her it ended bad. Esteban and her donâ€™t get along. She just left Friday night - it wasnâ€™t on good terms but we tried sheâ€™s just really dramatic yo
Aug 9 6:02pm
Iâ€™m glad to hear you all are enjoying Sunday fam time!
Aug 9 6:03pm
They are still homeschooled right?
Aug 9 6:03pm
I am impressed that you could handle 7 weeks. That is a long time. I wouldn't be able to do it with my own. I'm sorry it didn't end well.
Aug 9 6:04pm
Aye. Homeschooled.
Aug 9 6:04pm
Heavily considered schools up here, but after CV19, that's on hold.
Aug 9 6:04pm
Yea it was a challenge. Torn btw your welcome here and hold up you donâ€™t run shit! && heck yea Iâ€™m glad they are staying homeschooled - itâ€™s whatâ€™s safe. People think itâ€™s a game and all politics which Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s some truth in that but still very serious!
