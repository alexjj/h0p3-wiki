i try not to think of it often. because it frustrates me.
Feb 13 12:57am
but i have always believed that you. specifically. YOU individually. that YOU without question. Deserved an audiance. A stage grander than any other I have ever met. Although we may disagree. It is of zero consequence of my respect and genaral agreement of your argument.
Feb 13 12:58am
In truth I usually Find my diagreement with you derrived from a biased view of consumerism and labor. It doesnt chare out individual world perspective. I honestly do not think a differnt economic system would change our personal views on live and existance trenmendously.
Feb 13 1:00am
I might be mistaken. But i think if you but us both, in some parraeel universe of opposites in some utopia of ridiculous porportions.  i dont see me hating life, the world, people any different than before. maybe different hungers. literally and psycilogically. but the same empitines would reside.
Feb 13 1:02am
Well, hopefully in time I'll find the right audience. It's a hunt. I'm just that crazy person to most who encounter me (and they aren't wrong, lol).
Feb 13 1:26am
I hope we find a life of peace and fulfillment.
Feb 13 1:27am
I am on the edge of introducitng you to my stepfather.
Feb 13 1:27am
I will be exceptionally respectful.
Feb 13 1:27am
between the both of you. i Share all of my "smartest person i have ever met"
Feb 13 1:28am
Wish I could be there in person to share a beer with yall.
Feb 13 1:28am
i need to introduce him to your wiki.
Feb 13 1:28am
He'll know how insane I am then, lol.
Feb 13 1:28am

This isn't a capture out of a library these books I picked up covered in beer cans and cigarette ashes around a coffee table beside a broken futon my step dad had been living and sleeping at for the last several years.
Feb 13 1:34am
He has enough college credits to have his PhD.
Feb 13 1:35am
Accomplished carpenter and liscenswd registered nurse
Feb 13 1:35am
On disibility for an infection that owntrwted his bones and muscles
Feb 13 1:36am
He can hardly walk a bag of groceries up a set of stairs.
Feb 13 1:36am
I can see we would have a lot to talk about from those books alone.
Feb 13 1:40am
Send him my wiki. You can give my number and Signal if he'd like to chat too (or whatever works).
Feb 13 1:41am
i think exposing him slowly to a college friend would be interesting.
Feb 13 1:41am
his undergrade is in philosophy
Feb 13 1:41am
he is an intellectual without trying. i just learned shit from a step dad that made me look smart.
Feb 13 1:42am
he helped me to think a little
