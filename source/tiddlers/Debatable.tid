//High [[hope]]s for this game during [[Family Gathering]]s and unable to walk "walks" during [[Family Time]].//

!! Polite Timeliness:

* The Judge Team will use digital timers.
* In a duel, you are not allowed to speak after the timer goes off if and when the opponent says "stop", and if you continue beyond your time-limit, the opponent receives double the extra speaking time granted after the time-limit in the following section. 
** The exception: silence begins on the buzzer of the last 30-second Closing Statement.
* Judicial stalemates are resolved by coinflip.

!! Phases:

# Context Discovery
## The Judge Team assigns the question/prompt, perspectives, turn order, and the intended hypothetical audience to the duelists.
## The Judge Team provides both duelists 120-seconds to formulate an argument given a specification of the boundaries of tool use (e.g. can duelists search the internet, do they get to write anything down, etc?). 

# The Duel
## 30-second Opening Statements
## 120-second Body Statements
## 30-second Closing Statements

# Judicial Interrogation
## The Judge Team determines if the duelists actually attempted to play by the rules and win the game in [[good]] [[faith]].
## Required Pansy-ass Rhetorical Virtue Vote
##* The Judge Team collectively picks a winner in the game of "who offered the most persuasively moving performance to the intended audience?"
## Optional Skin-in-the-game Philosophical Virtue Vote
##* Each Judge may ask one question of each duelist.
##** A Judge cannot ask a question they aren't willing to answer. Duelists can require repeated rebuttals from Judges.
##* Each Judge may pick a winner in the game of "who offered the wisest argument?"
##** A Judge cannot pick out what is wise without being willing to offer and defend their position to everyone in the room.
