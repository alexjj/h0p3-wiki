title: 2020.11.12 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Music

* Exploring Music
** A walk down memory lane too.
** Blindly wandering human recommendations to find [[gem]]s, poorly. My frisson trigger is broken. I am not skilled at this.
*** I will never understand humans. I'd like to though.
* Coffee and leftovers
* Weeping in NIN, ofc
** Talk about holy music. I stand on hallowed ground. [[Awe]], indeed. Proud of myself for hearing it all again. I've been to hell and back with these anthems. Only a handful of tiddlers match this [[Music]] collection for me. It stands up there with {[[About]]}; I wouldn't be standing here without them. Extremely expensive to listen to this; decades of memories and impressions rushing back. The culling, a letting go, has been a long time coming. It will always be my honor, and I am lucky to be alive to hear it again. Wish I knew how to repay this person who can make multiple pieces of art (it's so rare for anyone to do that, art or otherwise) that allow me face my loneliness. `/bow`
* Read+Write+Walk+Talk
* AFireman Time!
* Sleep by 6:30
* Woke by 11:30
** Dreams and dizziness.
* Read+Write
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Walk With Offspring
** Rained, but not hard. Pitter patter.
** Ignored the obvious as best I could. Everyone is aware that I'm ignoring it, so it's not really ignored. 
** Talked philosophy and some surprisingly dangerous topics (I should not be surprised that they already have opinions on those matters).
* //Skintime//
** Her day was crazy. I'm glad she had a cool lunch though. Made up for it a bit.
** Memory was off. She's not keeping a set of gear like I beg her at the office (and in the vehicle). Horse to water problem.
* Fireman Time!
* Nap in lap as we watched //Star Trek: Discovery//
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Offspring made noodles, stir fry, wantons, apples, and I had two beers
** More trekking.
