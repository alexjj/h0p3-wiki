<<<
Reminding my daughter again to clean her hair out of the tub. The eyerolls still aren't expert yet. We'll get there.

Restructured the steel shelves for my clothes, etc. Cleaning. Cleaning. Cleaning. Also, laundry. Tried on old clothes, and many will not be kept (as mi amor has asked many times, I have thrown away socks that have large holes in them [I did get my money's worth]). I've lots of stuff to bring up to the attic. I've a bag marked "h0p3 is Fat," because maybe one day I won't be? Lol. I think I'm going to try moving back to just clean and dirty baskets, but with summer and winter divides.

It has finally snowed.

My sympaticon found a too good to be true deal off Amazon. I've needed a new mattress (which I keep on the floor, ofc, like any decent neckbeard) for many years. Found a pretty dope looking L-shaped couch futon thing `/squint` for $80 (I remember buying my first one for $100, a steal, when I was 16). Can't be real, right? I can't even get something used up from Goodwill for that price. Straight from China. `/fingers-crossed`.

Eggnog shots with my sympaticon + [[TTTOTW]] + //Red Rising// finished (the ending was disappointing, but perhaps sets us up for the real deal).

Chat with [[Ignota]].

Laundry. [[TTTOTW]]. Noodles. I'm finding myself easier and easier to doxx each year. Each site hack makes it worse too. //Andor//. 

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. //Inform the Men!// Assignments. Shower of the gods!

[[Family Time]]. We 4 played [[MTG]]. Clarinet. My son has pretty much traded as much as he can. Played a couple matches with my daughter, one before and after trading. I continue to make too many errors while playing. She's good at picking out resilient win conditions, and after examining her deck in functional analysis, I was impressed. It was cogent. Tightened it up. 

Watched //Around the World in 80 Days// + //Skintime// with mi amor. Show is horrific. 

Assignments. Quesadillas.

//Skintime// + //The Library at Mount Char// @01:00:40:50 with my sympaticon. Sleep by 9:15.

Woke at 2:30. Gumpination. Meditation. [[TTTOTW]]. I've decided to add a "Low-Priority" channel in my self-IMing. Might be pointless. [[Ignota]] exchanges. [[TTTOTW]] + //The Library at Mount Char// @02:00:02:26. 

Gave AtlasOS a spin, and I was impressed. It is the new XP Performance Edition, imho. Quite VMable. Duperemove requires exclusion, as it doesn't gracefully pass over non-btrfs/xfs filesystems mounted in the path. Fair enough. Sleep by 7:30?

Woke at 1:30? //Skintime// with my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]]. 

Shopping @ Costco with my sympaticon. Had a slice and fizzy drank. Lots of noodles and non-perishables. I also grabbed more cold-climate clothing and some gloves for my son. 

Shopping @ Aldi with my sympaticon. Two carts, and well-priced. 

[[TTTOTW]].

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. //Inform the Men!// Meditation. 

Hugs'n'bugs with folks. Made sammiches for me and my sympaticon. We had chocolates too. [[TTTOTW]]. //Skintime// with my sympaticon. [[TTTTOW]]. Mi amor is not enjoying //Red Rising// so much. We're hard to find books for (much, much easier for [[link]]s though).

Duperemove exclusion does not work on a mounted ext4 subdirectory. Piping might be possible. I could try to go btrfs (with plenty of tweaking for torrenting) and see if it will work then, but I'm concerned there are other possible failure modes. Can't make it pretty. Safer to just have two directories.

After looking at Tribler again, I've another wishlist item. //House of the Dragon// + Water + [[TTTOTW]].
