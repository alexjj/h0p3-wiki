title: 2020.11.17 - Prompted Introspection: Guilt

!! Write about the last time you felt guilty.

Today. Every single time I go grocery shopping, I feel like I'm selling my soul when I buy luxuries. Some needs are more necessary than others, and it's easy to see I'm buying drugs. The fruits and vegetables are easy luxuries to defend. The turkey we will make for Thanksgiving is expensive, but it is a yearly celebration. The foods that are convenient for my wife's lunches or fit her severe lactose intolerance seem reasonable given her time crunches and counterbalancing stress in her day. I often favor substance use, but I know my chips and banana bread aren't even good for me though. We bought steak again. Yeah, it's $7 bucks to feed the family, but I have a rough idea of how many people aren't getting steak or any meat. 

I'm talking to the kid at the register, never seen him before. He's probably new (that I would even know that he is probably new is a privilege). He's talking with me about how he's doing that day, what he's doing for Thanksgiving, #adulting, capitalism/BLM, and he's looking at how much we're getting. He jokes that this isn't even the largest haul he's seen this week. He comes from a big family he says, and he knows what it's like having teenagers in the house. Still, I'm thinking, while the kid knows where his next meal is coming from, he very likely doesn't have a fridge stocked (we didn't either until we went shopping, but I don't think he has a point in his month where it's ever fully-stocked), the convenience and addictive deliciousness of some of these foods, a deep freezer that provides flexibility, a pantry that benefits from buying in bulk, an ark for safety, or 3-months supply of rice and beans in his home, and he's not even in deep poverty. I know what it's like not having the safety of these things, let alone having the convenience and hedonic-luxuries.

Do I think I'm responsible for this? Not so much. I pull my weight, and I'm frugal. Do I think that in a fair world these luxuries would be unreasonable for anyone to acquire (given a fulfilled maximin principle in [[TOP]])? No. It does require me to face my selfish desire for overextending beyond my justified (and limited) self-ownership though. Trying to be fair here is "good problems," and that too causes it. Empathy ought not be conflated with guilt, I realize.
