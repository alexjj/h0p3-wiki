*** I found a new game this week, called Unfortunate Spaceman. I plan on grinding it for the skills and abilities. My work this week was meh but the Leet drafting I did was in those words, Leet. I'm hopeful that I can make a good character or that my sister will make one for me in her DnD game. I've been loving the soda water.
** j3d1h
*** Your RP code is coming along nicely. If you want, I'm happy to organize this into a classic guidebook style, and you could actually have a fleshed-out RP character from this! Even without that, it is impressive work. I'm sorry this week has been rather rough for you, but I think it will get better soon. Your notes for Democritus are very clean and easy to read, which is a very good sign for the presentation itself!
**** I think I will take your offer up on the classic guidebook style!
** k0sh3k
*** Democritus was known as "The Laughing Philosopher," and why is important. Also, we need more laughing philosophers. Jerky+hummus is delicious and you should try it. I've ordered you some more melatonin; it should be here this week sometime. I think you had a pretty good week for my schoolwork this week - I liked your Lightning Thief work, although I expected a bit more in math. I loved that you picked up on the comparison of Perseus and Percy's dealings with their mothers' husbands! I think it's important that Percy gave his mother the power to free herself while Perseus uses the power to free his mother for himself. I am so proud of how much you've grown in your writing and literary analysis over the summer! 
** h0p3
*** [[1uxb0x]] delivered 40% this week. It could have gone better. He's had to deal with some heavy emotions, and he's done it with us constructively too. I hold his honesty in high regard. He had some fun too. He's got a new game, //Unfortunate Spaceman//, and he's getting into [[Debatable]] more. He's enjoyed soda water and living in his beautifully-deviantly unique mind. He continues to look longer and older too (and I normally don't notice that stuff very easily).

* [[j3d1h]]
** 1uxb0x
*** Sister, I shall take you up on thine offer. I like your work on Protagoras. Because you also have one of those robot characters, do you plan on making code for them? If you do plan on making code for them, what packages would you carry over from my system? I'm glad you have a choice in whether or not you have title.titles
** j3d1h
*** I didn't do the best of jobs this week, but I think some things got done for sure. I've made significant progress in the things I love. The RP going on has kicked up quite a bit, and I hope I can keep being of use in it! My presentation on Protagoras is going to be a nightmare, but I'm very happy with the work I put in. Next week's forecast is "probably fun and more work done", stay tuned.
** k0sh3k
*** I think it's neat that you turned your Debatable question into a Prompted Introspection. I wonder if you should tag those, so you can keep track of them? I wish you would talk more about RPing in your wiki; what are y'all doing? Can you summarize the story for us? You don't have to, of course, but SmokeyLemon are such a big part of your not-us life that it'd be nice to see something of what y'all are doing. 
** h0p3
*** [[j3d1h]] is working toward her vacation; if she delivers one more good week, then it's hers. She's earning it. It feels like we have a chance to cultivate her ideal and material autonomy here too. We're in the dry run before the Fall Semester, and she's possibly signaled effectively that he father should not interfere with her work. She handles a lot of emotions and thoughts well beyond her years, and it is important that I remember she is 14. She's been dressing up more, and her RP+Art world that she builds with her friends continues to grow. As she is to her brother, she is an exceptional friend to [[j3d1h: Entity]]; she is a friend to everyone she meets. 90% of the time she gives advice (which she does sparingly), I feel like I couldn't have understood and said it that well. She's got me thinking about wiki design more too.

** 1uxb0x
*** I think I like Warehouse 13 as well. Thank you for giving me fun books like Harry Potter and The Lighting Thief. You really like Spore, I wonder if I should try it out. I didn't know you used to play spy type games, and ones that were roleplaying as well. It sucks that you have have to become braindead after work.
** j3d1h
*** Spore seems to have been really fun for you, and I'm glad! The most I get out of the game is making horrible monstrosities in the second stage, personally, but it's good that the game as a whole is fun for you. Getting a parrot would be a horrific idea, trust me. Too many unsavory and evil things are said in this house for any other outcome. Your book club sounds very fun, and I'm happy that you are having a good time with it so far! I think you named Sigi the way you did because you just want h0p3 to shut up.
** k0sh3k
*** I think I did a good job on my book club, and everyone in the club had fun! I like the way I prepared beforehand; I don't know how it'll go when others are in charge, of course, but I intend to do a summary and recommendation for each one, anyway, and then record the questions asked and answer them on the wiki, too. (Maybe the dessert or a drink question for each one, too? I'll have to think on it.) Work was stressful, which no doubt contributed to my headaches and general grumpiness; I also spent a //lot// of time playing Spore and watching Warehouse 13 and not much time reading - I just needed some braindead time after work each day.
** h0p3
*** [[k0sh3k]]'s bookclub went awesomely. I'm glad to see her anticipation met with satisfaction. It is both a pleasure and an honor to reckon with her Biblical Interpretation. She's been feeling sick, stressed, and having difficulty sleeping. Walking has even been her idea, and it's the best part of my day. //MasterChef//, food, //Warehouse 13//, and //Spore// have been her drugs of choice. Don't worry, my [[love]], we have the rest of our lives as the timer for our debate. I cannot imagine how she deals with all the social dynamics in her life; it's absurd. Her wiki is often so epistolary; I'm like a moth to a flame.

* [[h0p3]]
** 1uxb0x
*** Thank you for trying to show us Gödel's incompleteness theorems. I believe understand Gödel's number system. I don't think you'd like the game I found. I think the types of games you like are the kinds that you couldn't ever complete once. That no matter how much you grind you will never complete in a life time, and it's always growing. I think your life this week was better than normal.
** j3d1h
*** You didn't write much in the way of dynamic tiddlers this week, but that's alright. You were busy. Your Root User hubs are very interesting, and I'm excited to see what happens with them! Are they for you to write in, the users themselves, or both? Thank you for trying to be extra patient on our presentations.
** k0sh3k
*** I'm beginning to think Schopenhauer didn't like Hegel. I can tell that you spent a lot of the week thinking about your conversations with others and how they reflect and shape your relationships with them. The rest of our lives is too long a time for you to be allowed to argue with me, especially when you're obviously going to lose. Chris was an interesting dude; I wonder how he's doing? I still hear sporadically from Shiela, but we mostly just talk about the kids. Yeah, it seems your week was spent in much contemplation of your relationships with others. And masturbation, of course. 
** h0p3
*** [[h0p3]] did not accomplish his goals in [[Wiki Review]], but he's been productive. He's been thinking about people a lot. He also missed doing [[h0p3ful Review]] with his daughter each night, but he accepts that she gets to choose whether or not they spend that time together in that practice. Walks have been tremendous, and cannabliss a spark. He watched a lot of garbage this week while the nightmare of the world unfolds. Also, his wiki may be a cure for insomnia (puts everyone to sleep); it helps him sleep. He's hoping to see his offspring kick some ass and enjoy some vacation time.
