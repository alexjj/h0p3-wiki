title: 2020.06.18 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Serious Conversations

* Woke at noon
** Good sleep. 
* Encouraging my offspring to figure out what they are going to prepare for dinner.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Pushed offspring to define their plans
* Wikis
* Read+Write
* Canvassing
* Walk+Talk
* Plumber/Fixitman came
** He's the one that has not done the best job in this place (told me the work he's done thus far). His troubleshooting was off, imho. The questions he asked did not show competence. I am grateful that we are getting something possibly fixed (and that we have at least done our due diligence).
* Vapelyfe
* Taskmaster
* Read+Write
** [[Sphygmus]] and Tony have dominated my reasoning today.
* Walk with wife
** The highlight of my day. 
** Talked and talked. Been thinking about a lot of [[FTO]].
* Read+Write
* Offspring made a special squash dish (they found the recipe) that was delicious + Jamaican hotpockets
** My son and I worked on peeling safely.
** [[Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση]]: Presentations on [[Anaximander]] and [[Thales]]. 
*** Refined our arguments.
* [[h0p3ful Review]]: My son's was quick. My daughter sent me a message that required hours of discussion.
** I am lucky to have such an articulate and honest daughter. I am grateful that she shares her feelings with me. She's quite a woman.
** Completed her [[h0p3ful Review]], and didn't finish until 1 something?
* Walk+Talk
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 4
