[[TTTOTW]]. [[ASK]]'s workin' on escaping Spotify and searching for all the projects, as she does. We made sala bow (or whatever it's called) with aluminum foil for a makeshift steam basket. Worked perfectly. //Skintime//. Sleep by 4.

Woke at 11. Meditation. Pushed Brix. //Skintime// with [[ASK]]. [[TTTOTW]].

Offspring came down to grind. We didn't talk much. My son has figured out what's tripping the breaker. I had a nutterbutter and apples. Eventually, we cleaned up downstairs. Hung things. Sorted through bajillions of cables (I'm only keeping two cubes of computer equipment down here). Spare parts to things I still use, and I probably should get a craft box just to hold these. Son installed a switch for us downstairs, as wireless has way more interference down here now, and [[ASK]]'s beast just needs a hard wire. Laundry.

Walkin' through mi amor's promotion documents. Way more to this than just getting the job. Many maintain the position for life, and the hoops are there. A likes her evaluator list, but I want to know what S thinks (who is far more careful, from what I can see).

[[JRE]] called. Boys have been sick, but today is their first day back to daycare. [[Rb]] was sick as well. He took [[Bn]] to the doctor, and he enjoys being the guy who comforts his son. Asked about [[ASK]], ofc, as my [[Root Users]] may. He's still doing busy work on the job. [[Rb]] is worried about not doing enough, and she's hating school even more because it's not being taken seriously (diploma mill likely). Talked about [[Rb]] walkin' in on his setup downstairs (also, he recommends the Husky workbench, highly, though thinks a desk is still necessary). From the sounds of it, the odds are good none of the brothers care that much for having their dicks sucked (sensation is too much). //Midnight Mass// discussion again, and I continue to point toward lack of a steelman, and he, ofc, wrestles with stories of purpose. Yup. That's us. 

[[TTTOTW]].

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. Frustrations. She's feeling overwhelmed but also there's a part of her that is, like, so over it, it'll be what it'll be. `/nod`. 

[[TTTOTW]]. [[5c0ut]]'s not feeling well. //Skintime// with [[ASK]].

[[Family Gathering]] was outstanding. My offspring made tendies, salad, and wedges (heavy seasoning again, yuss). I made chicken salad. I had water too. There was nothing left by the end, so they made just the right amount. We watched the Dwarf episode of //House//. 

[[TTTOTW]]. I tripped the breaker down here as well, and for some reason my wife's room is connected to this room's. That is surprising to me. Anyway, the good news is that I've got two breaker's worth of circuits down here, as the outlet next to the box is loaded to the brim with two stacked UPS's. I may put the heater on a timer. An hour goes a very long way. Game 5 of FIDE Championship. Bouncing between my girls and my [[monster]]. My daughter told me to vacate the kitchen. Okay. Mi amor brought me mini-cupcakes and a kombucha (I think this shit is growing on me). 

//The Walk// with [[ASK]]. Took the long route, then she led us on the new one.
