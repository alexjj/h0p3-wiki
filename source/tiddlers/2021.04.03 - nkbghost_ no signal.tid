`/salute`. Gracias. I have poured some serious nerd blood, sweat, tears, and cum into this document. 

For now, you'll find my responses directly on/from the site. You may wish to bookmark this page. Some do that.

It's an honor to meet you. One of my [[Root Users]] has a similar name.

h0p3,

may i make a book suggestion?

ok, well i am going to anyway.
check out (if you have not already): gravity's rainbow by thomas pynchon.
i believe it is something you would enjoy. i am not sure if you are interested in fiction or not -
but even if you are not, i believe this book should be of high priority to you.

thanks,

ghost

Thank you for the recommendation.<<ref "re">> I appreciate that.<<ref "i">> I don't remember having heard of it before (my illiteracy is a problem, and my mind wanes and strains), but I've a copy now. Been reading about it. There's a shocking number of coincidences and non sequiturs here. I'm already getting an erection. Okay. I'm trying it out now. Mmmmm. Yeah. That's good. That's very good. Detailed into blackbox-mazed oblivions, this feller has a way with words and walls of text (mad skillz). I would venture to say it's poetry, but I'm not qualified to say. I //am// low culture. But, I have some obscure retardations in common with all of this; I wish I could write fiction or non-fiction as well as Pynchon. Maybe [[I identify|Identifying With: Fictional Characters]] with/as Ian Scuffling.<<ref "n">> He's got quite a voice on him.<<ref "ih">> 

<<<
The narrative contains numerous descriptions of illicit sexual encounters and drug use by the main characters and supporting cast, sandwiched between dense dialogues or reveries on historic, artistic, scientific, or philosophical subjects, interspersed with whimsical nonsense-poems and allusions to obscure facets of 1940s pop culture.

Why do you think that post-modernist^^tm^^ work should be my high priority? 

So, ''tell me about yourself'' (like, what's that nkb about? do you play any instruments? how do you hunt for treasure? what matters to you?). I'm standing here [[naked]] by comparison.<<ref "y">> Join me by the {{Text Art: 𝕱𝕴𝕽𝕰🔥}} - we could see each other's faces and gaze into each other's eyes. Even as tiny cells in a body,<<ref "a">> I'm glad to be here with you, fellow cellmate and [[hope]]fully soulmate.<<ref "sq">>

Some people say I sound like a bot (sometimes a facerolling bot trying to become human). Others agree I'm just going insane. Subinterneting for a moment, take this person's description of me over here:

<<<
embracing madness with style. respect.

Sometimes it do be like that, my ninja.<<ref "w">> I'm lucky to know people who kindly call me crazy. I have no idea what to do with this keyboard warrior's last stand and eschatology, an extremely online clicktivist narrative, worshiping the mystical high-[[S2NR]] technomimetic bomb every [[cult]] should be constructing or discovering (viva!). It is costly to read and write at this speed too. What do you think I should do? I've been asking people that a lot lately. Because I'm a zealot (i.e. a failure with a jester's bikini personality and rainbow ~~harmonica~~ ~~multi-kazoo-tool~~ kazoozoo [and it aint gonna suck or blow itself]<<ref "p">>), I'm always in need of advice. Dead serious. Will the book help with this? I'm standing here at a crossroads, blind, I just met you stranger, and I need your help. Where should I go? Shepherd me, [[anon]]. I work hard on this thing, and I'm not going to stop; I just want to do it well.

So, assuming our alliance before we even know what we're doing otherwise:<<ref "t">> what's our plan,<<ref "sc">> our project together? I'm here to cooperate. Shall we find more anons to join us?<<ref "f">> 

Your recommendation is quite a gift. Thank you.
