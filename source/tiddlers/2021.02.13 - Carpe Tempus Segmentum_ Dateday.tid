Shootin' the shit with [[T-Money]]. Man is in a rough spot. Heavy use tonight. I hear that.

Daughter is staying up way fucking late to work on [[monster-10]] (hers now). I handed her a very long list of things that needed to be done. She's gonna be way, way better than I will ever be at this shit. Very long discussion about options in computing for her (glad to hear she still adores computers :P...I have not absolutely failed, thank goddess).

Watching LoL while writing. Drinking a beer, eating some pizza. 2005, you couldn't convince me not to have two monitors. 2015, you couldn't convince me that I'd really want two monitors ever again. 2021, I need three monitors. Who knows what my dumbass is going to think a decade from now. I'll say that VR titties are amazing (reminds me, that oculus box hasn't even been opened [my son's RPi robot/car thing is untouched too...I'm surprised]).

No idea what time I slept, but I got enough sleep. I would like to stop paying attention to it, if I can. Nothing is expected of me on this front on a consistent basis anymore. Why give a fuck then?

Madame [[chameleon]] HMU4VC! Scared her with my beard and wild hair. Chill and real. I'm so happy to hear from her. I know I'm the intrusive sort. Continue to give her permission to contact me any time. Sent her the olvoldy link to make life easier.

Offspring set on task.

Found my bro's wiki for him. He should probably just start from scratch and import. 

Oil massage on the table, put on the Bridgerton show for her. Then Jabba had his treat. Good god, that woman knows how to fuck. Shower was delightful. Grabbed burgers and fries, and we watched //Bridgerton// and got some cuddles in. She's lettin' me pause more. I am her retard. She is ever disappointed in my narrative failures; it's not fair to have to speak with a genius on this topic. This day was amazing.
