>>>>> I will think about your excellent questions. My draft will show up here (https://philosopher.life/#Enricoce).

>>>> I see the project and I am surprised, it is suitable for experts. If you were in a free-group of a social network and it was at risk of closure due to cyber attacks (already happenend) or seizure of the servers (denial of freedom of speech in America), what back-up platform would you propose? A group in Telegram ? A group in Wire ? These things needs to be planned in advance, I am not a fan of Parler but the lesson is fresh.

>>> `/salute`. Also, in case you prefer a more private means of communicating: https://philosopher.life/#Contact%20h0p3

>> Many thanks! Just saw now the notice, I will test and give you my impression.

> Hi there, my name is h0p3. I use Tiddlywiki (https://philosopher.life). It's offline first (and even my readers can use it offline). I push it across many networks. For the web, I've stopped running a server in a datacenter (which I don't own either) and just do a minutely push to github/gitpages. It's slow to load, but it has so much more content than you'd predict. Feel free to HMU, btw. I'm happy to help you design a system if you need or just talk for whatever reason.

Suggestions - Leaving Blogger platform (BigG) which alternatives ?

I have been using Blogger since 2007, some blogs and many posts, yes I use also wordpress free and simple option, if tomorrow I would switch for another platform what would you suggest ? My posts are reviews on gadgets, travel, films, articles, nothing special, but I would not like to be de-platformed or censored, so as I move all my data away from bigTech I am looking for a new place. I would like, litlle by little to import some posts into the new platform. Thank you in advance.
