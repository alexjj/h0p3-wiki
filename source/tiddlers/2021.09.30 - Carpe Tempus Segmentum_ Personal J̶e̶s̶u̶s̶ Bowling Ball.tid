title: 2021.09.30 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Personal J̶e̶s̶u̶s̶ Bowling Ball

Picked a fridge out for her. Measurements for whiteboard suggest I'd have to build the wall out still. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]] + LEC + [[ASK]]ing. Sleep by 2?

Woke at 5. Couldn't get back to sleep. Meditation. She's up. She slept like shit, fek. =/. It's in the global water supply. Her bra is too tight, imho.<<ref "i">> She needs some new ones. I had millennial toast, she a bagel, and we have extra coffee for me (and for [[1uxb0x]], just in case). We sat at that table, and I grossed her out as Meow licked my armpit (I lick my wife's armpits all the time though, so...) and nuzzled. She talked about an interesting story that takes the portal device more seriously, and she's so glad there's no romantic interest in the story (`/sigh`). Many XOXOs before she brings home bacon and perfect hips I'm really in need of.<<ref "p">> Go forth, and kick ass, woman. Prep for dinner.

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]] + chips'n'guac + LCK Finals<<ref "d">> (Like everyone else with eyes, I will admit that I am a Fakerfanboi, and I am aware that I am irrational for doing so). Fireman Time! Vapelyfe. [[ASK]]ing. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time!<<ref "h">> [[TTTOTW]].

Flashes.

The Offspring came down to work with me on picking out [[Prompted Introspection]]s. These last bunch have helped me recognize that I should probably tackle a much larger set of moral dilemmas, questionnaires, intuition pumps, casuistry machinery, etc. Ultimately, I can't flesh out the semantic content of some of my {[[Axioms]]} without a lot more of these boundary chasing questsm triangulating the center(s), and revealing the whole schizophrenically changing toward [[The Absolute]]. [[TTTOTW]]. [[5c0ut]] came down to chill with us. I think it's awkward for him a bit because we're working, just listening to music while we grind. 

//The Walk// with my offspring was superb. Well, except that she didn't do her work (though I was handed my card); at least she was socializing, reading, and writing her own stuff (that I like...wish she would show us). My son enjoyed his yoga and music (though it remains to be seen if his mother will be happy with the results), and more importantly, he brought us down a huge rabbithole where we went through some of the key components of the philosophy of law. He opened with talking about repos, trying to define renting a car, and then we went into the nature of different kinds of contracts in the American legal system (with some comparisons), ingrained classism (again and again and again), and the usual problems in trying to flesh out what actually consists in a positive law from several squishy angles (a terribly ugly and human problem, no doubt), etc. There's simply too much ground to cover (and, this is not the first time we've covered it, and I'm not ultimately equipped to do it well enough either). It was a fast walk without the loop because my daughter reminded me that we had to take her to her bloodwork appointment. Relegated to only an hour with these creatures; I don't know what I'm going to do when I lose that. I still feel the hole in me from not having them with me all day.

So, she's navigating, I'm driving, and we're halfway there when the SUV just fucking dies, electrical failure (I was having a bit of trouble with it yesterday when I took them to Home Depot). It was a busy on-ramp-like area downtown with no shoulder, but I was able to coast to the exact 10-foot space in my coasting range that would allow traffic to pass me without blocking the road too terribly. Unfortunately, the car behind us got hit by the car behind them (despite there being a stop sign). No one was happy, and there was sizable traffic jam. Eventually the pigs came to tell the ladies behind me to do what they should have done: move out of the way. Only had to flash my license, as the accident was between them. My daughter helped me quite a bit with a buzzing flurry of phone calls, internet searches, and figuring out where we were, etc. (she's right there being useful in a pinch and a jam). Nobody to rescue us, but eventually we had a tow truck come. It was all relatively quick. Once we were done with the pigs and the SUV was otw to the mechanic, I wasn't anxious. I'm like: whatever. That is privilege. We walked back to the house (since we were downtown anyway, not far). Walking through how and why we speak to pigs as I did, interpreting people's reactions, more about why we need our documentation, liability and insurance, what to do when you have emergencies with vehicles (and eventually how different it was for those who remember the 80s and 90s, which was a different experience, no doubt), and the finances behind buying cars as cheaply as we do given the pressures we've faced (napkin math to boot). I continue repeating myself year after year, usually with more depth on each iteration; I know it's annoying to her (but I don't know what else to do). I enjoyed my second walk with my daughter. We had fun on the bridge overlooking the rushing river (right down the mountainside from our house), but she left me the moment I started to act upon the "down to the river to pray" song (that song is good, yo). 

We were about to walk up the K2 sheer when we saw her driving toward us. We smiled. She picked us up, and she refused to let me take her home. Went to the appointment, quite late. Apparently, they didn't have all the paperwork sent to them, so the appointment was a bust anyway. Aight. Went to the mechanics next, and the Derek feller (the one who is a skilled liar and salesman) clearly has a strong memory for patterns of numbers but not the stories of who we are. Set the account in my name since I'm gonna call the shots anyway. I wasn't anticipating the vehicle was going to last another year, so I'm not upset. It did its job, and the rest is gravy.

//Raw Skintime//. She's upset, and understandably so. Been a stressful day, and she still feels uncomfortable about the exam. She's having to do M's job (and fighting about dumb shit, and scheduling is still wildly off), and A isn't doing his (literally everyone else is upset though). She's worried about school taking up so much time, and she's unhappy with (a) how little time she gets with her offspring, and (b) that when she does get time with them, she feels compelled to continue telling them do what they are supposed to do (despite agreeing that this is really up to them, and she's done everything she ought). STFU card invoked (gently), and my job is to let her vent while I stroke her hair. She agrees her period is coming. She refused not to have sex though (despite my making several arguments that she should chill, study, etc.). Well, I reckon I'd be a fool to deny her the 4th time. 

//Inform the Men!// Meditation. Shower of the gods! [[ASK]]ing. She knows exactly what I want to know. Lol. What she says to some people is over-the-top. [[TTTOTW]].

[[Family Gathering]]. The offspring made pork chops, baked potatoes and gravy, and zucchini + yellow squash. It was delicious, and the food did not last long on my plate. We watched the Cuddy's Fixit Man episode of //House//. My wife studied while we watched. She walked me through why sections of her work weren't well-suited to the standard notecard (and, yet again, I think the wiki is well-suited as part of the solution, even if hand-writing engages her spatial reasoning more [which, it is becoming clearer she must leverage]).
