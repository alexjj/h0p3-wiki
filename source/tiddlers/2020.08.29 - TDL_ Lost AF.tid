title: 2020.08.29 - TDL: Lost AF

* [[Family Time]] must start early!
* More discussions of move and Fall Semester
* Catchup, loser. =)
* Perhaps another shot at the steel cicada
* Tendies, veggies, ice cream
* You should TOTALLY read more about what you have 0.00001% [[power]] over. That makes perfect sense.<<ref "i">> 
** Watching people play video games makes even more sense. You play right into it, and you know it.
** Have I ever told you, [[h0p3]], how much I despise the truth too often? Omg. It's insane. Go on. Get your breakdown broken down. Get on with it. I don't think you even have half the right to lose your mind.
*** I am feeling so fucking lost right now, and I have no excuse for it. 
**** What would you do in a video game? 
***** God damn do I feel lost when I don't even know what I'd do in a video game. It's not a video game. The stakes are real. I hate that you waste your time, [[h0p3]]. I don't know what you are supposed to do either though. You aint alone there.
