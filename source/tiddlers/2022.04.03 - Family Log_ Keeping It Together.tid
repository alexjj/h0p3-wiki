* 1uxb0x
** I've been doing better than nothing for a while now. I'm happy that I'm atleast doing something.
** Thank you for thinking about more things we can do together. I like spending time with you, sir.
** You have grown into a very even-keeled guy, with a good handle on your emotions who is careful to consider others' needs and desires when deciding what you want to do and how you should react; I am very proud of you!
*** 100
** you're getting much better at caring for your hair!
** I had a lot of fun playing Diablo with you. Thank you for the party.
* j3d1h
** i like all the movement i manage to put into my art and writing.
** I like that we're doing Wordle together. :) It's fun to compare.
** I like that you //play// with new techniques.
** I appreciate that you come down to chill with us even if you aren't engaged in all of the same activities we are.
** It's impressive that you've somehow converted both cats to be "yours" in many contexts. Extra surprising to flip Meow. You're good with small animals, and you pay attention to them. I'm glad to see your kindness.
*** You're definitly gonna be a crazy cat lady.
**** i already am :]
** Thank you for helping me with my hair!
** You cosplay an excellent horse girl.
* k0sh3k
** I got a 99 on my Greek midterm! Yay!
** I did the LSF transfer perfectly - no bounce-backs!
** I helped a student worker plan for a better Ramadan than she thought she'd have, which led to discussions about future interfaith plans!
** I also arranged the opportunity for any of my student workers to get MHFA certification if they want it!
** Thank you spending your Saturday with me (amazing) and all of us. You get very little you-time for someone as radically introverted as you are. You are generous with your spoons, time, and effort.
** When you're doing Greek, you'll sometimes do fun tid-bits with us about it.
*** <3
** your book demon ideas were very fun, thank you. :)
** I really enjoy listening to you work on your greek. I am glad your hard work paid off with nice scores.
* h0p3
** I'm glad you played, sir. It fit the rules.
** I'm glad we had the chance to walk a few times this week; I'm glad the weather is warming up for it! Thank you for the conversations - you continue to help me think out loud through my own beliefs and experiences.
*** <3
** I'm happy that you try to get me more into the games you like. 
** you pick a lot of very crazy friends, and a handful of //very// good ones.
** Thank you for being there for me. I'm sorry it hurts. I wish the world was better.
** Thank you for playing with me!
** Thank you for walking with me.
** Thank you for your patience. I know it can't possibly be literally boundless, but I appreciate the way that you make me feel like it is.
** You are worth every pain and I hope I can keep myself together long enough to see the someday that you still believe is possible.
** Thank you for your hope. Please 
* ASK
** I'm enjoying having you kick my butt in our games. It's a treat. I also can't recall the last time I had this much sustained fun. Pretty amazing.
** I respect how much effort and thought you put into your self-control. It's crazy hard to do. 
** It's a joy to see your raw excitement and to hear your experienced opinion on cooking and gardening. 
** I've enjoyed playing D2 with you.
** Thank you for making dinner so often! You're also very thoughtful about making sure everyone is supplied with tea when they want some.
** Some most excellent fudge this week, s'mores fudge is a keeper, but too rich for common. Pull it out to impress. Smaller pieces as well. More marshmallows. More graham crackers. 
** i would (and will) probably eat that entire tin of s'mores fudge. it's ridiculously good.
