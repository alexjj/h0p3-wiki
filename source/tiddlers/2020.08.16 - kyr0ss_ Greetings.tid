Hello h0p3,

I don't usually reach out to people on the internet. I know i should, but I don't. I chose to contact you mainly to express my gratitude for your work. 
It's been a month since I discovered your wiki, I think a guy on reddit mentioned it, and I study it ever since. 

I was a TW user long time ago, and I had trouble organizing my thoughts for years, changing tools, but never realized the true power of a wiki. My wiki is not public, I'm too introvert to do something like your project, plus I don't write so nice as you (come on, after all you're a philosopher) since English is not my mother language. I copied lots of your mechanics, like reviews, TDLs and hubs because I think they're brilliant. I hope you don't mind. 

I like the fact that you built your wiki to be deciphered by reading different pieces, catching the rhythm of your thinking which is so hard. I can't appreciate your texts like I should because I have so many unknown words, but I catch the feel of them. 

I am also a linux user, a father, concerned about online privacy, writing journal entries and creating software toolboxes. 
I'm so happy about my wiki and for the fact that I don't have to customize my emacs anymore. 

Thank you for your work.üëç

Sincerely, 
kyr0ss
