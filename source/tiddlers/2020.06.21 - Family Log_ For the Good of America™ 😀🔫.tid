!! Write a paragraph summarizing each person's week given the wikis:

* [[1uxb0x]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I think I failed on my homework for this week. I think I got bad sleep this week as well as sleeping in this night. I don't think I've been too harsh on myself but I've definitally been harsh on myself. I have played games a bit more that normal and managed to have a very fun moment in it. I accidentally spelled dynamic tiddlers dynamic toddlers.
** j3d1h
*** I'm very worried that you're being too harsh on yourself. Nonetheless, your mathematics work was very cool. I liked helping out with your Lightning Thief paper, though I hope I wasn't too harsh? Dynamic toddlers are the worst kind. A lot of your logs are going brrr, it's wonderful that you pick up on memes like that. Trust me, it will help you interact with quite a few friend groups.
** k0sh3k
*** You took good notes on the cooking in the future video; I wish you'd done a recipe, but I can tell you paid attention to the video and I think you like these videos, right? I'm glad you're keeping track of your gameplay! You had some days where you didn't write much, and other days when you wrote more - I hope those even out to a good amount of writing each day! I think perhaps you need to find easier quotes to wrestle with in your Antipleonasm Analysis writings or you need to spend more time thinking about what the writer is actually trying to say - I feel like your getting just off to the side of the point, often. Wiki goes brrrr.
** h0p3
*** [[1uxb0x]] worked for self-control this week, and it shows. Damn heavy lifting. He's not getting all his schoolwork done, but he's made progress in every topic and performed well in CS, [[Leet]] Drafting, and it was a pleasure having 1-on-1 time with him during our [[h0p3ful Review]]. He planned and prepared a fine meal with his sister on Thursday. He's been developing a better understanding and use of the pragmatics of cooperation. It is my honor to know his negative feelings too; that is a lot of trust, and I will do my best.

* [[j3d1h]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I think me and my sister have sent each other some meems this week that were fun. I agree with my mother that you should put your art in your wiki. I also agree with mother that we like the Curiosity stream videos. Thank you for finding the butternut squash recipe.
** j3d1h
*** I like my recipes this week. They're fun to put together, and both sound pretty delicious. My work for k0sh3k was varied, but it turned out well, I think. Some of my work for h0p3 was good, some of it was not. I'm definitely happy with a lot of what I did this week. Hopefully, I can keep my motivation going.
** k0sh3k
*** I am surprised you don't put your art in your wiki; I like seeing it on Discord, but it's something that means so much to you that I'd like to see it have it's own place on your wiki, too. I like your cricket recipe - maybe we'll try it sometime? :D I think you like the Curiosity Stream videos, too. You found a great butternut squash and sweet potato recipe! You should hunt recipes to try more often!
** h0p3
*** [[j3d1h]] seems to expand the the meaning of [[art]] and design for herself a little bit every day, and it shows. She wrote with incredible disagreement, vehement kindness, and honest wisdom with me; it is my honor as a [[father|BAGD]] to think and feel as carefully with her as anyone I've ever met. Sometimes we are mirrors and lenses for and with each other for the sake of something much greater than either of us. I aim to have a 10k-hour conversation with everyone, but with her, I wish for a 100k-hour conversation; she builds and binds us together.

* [[k0sh3k]]
** 1uxb0x
*** It was kind of you to make the rattlesnake braclet for my father.  I'm pretty sure your ankle is fully healed. I'm really happy (is that the right word?) with this weeks RCL. I'm sorry for doing a bad job on your work for this week.
** j3d1h
*** Your RCL (and sermon) were amazing, thank you so much for those. Again, you are writing more prompted introspections. I love the work you do in them! I know it was annoying, but thank you for still setting up your timelines. Pok√©moto looks very cool, I'm excited to try it.
** k0sh3k
*** I should make rice pudding more often. I worked really hard on back-to-work plans while also attending a virtual conference; I miss actual conferences, where I'm actually unreachable and can't be asked to attend meetings or do other stuff while at conference. Also, I really like conferences. I like the notes I took during the conference, however - I took an awful lot of them! - but they would be hard to take in an actual, physical conference. Pok√©moto is awesome, and I'm going to enjoy that as my birthday dinner!
** h0p3
*** [[k0sh3k]] has been thinking about how to make beaded jewelry for [[others]]. Her conference was productive, but it was odd to see how her co-workers loaded her up with work during it (these are valuable signals). She walked with her husband throughout the week. I cherish our time together. She's continuing to gear up for heading back to her worksite on a provisional basis, and so are we, =/. I'm doing an okay job of not letting the dread that I won't be able to see her throughout the day ruin the time I have left with her. It is my privilege to be able to have my Saturdates with her; I want nothing else for myself in those moments.

* [[h0p3]]
** 1uxb0x
*** You had a very serious talk with my sister this week, it disracted me so I just dicided to listen. I like your idea of leet drafting, but I fear I will fail to do it. I can't read your new wiki name, so all I see is `        : [[h0p3]]`. The h0p3ful reviews were quite sad this week, but they got better over time. Thank you for the meems/maymays.
** j3d1h
*** h0p3ful review was very good this week. Thank you for listening to my vent-letter, that's much better than most fathers would ever do. You're talking to a lot of people again - I wonder if they talk more to you when you've been talking to others? This has been a gradual and constant change, but I'm glad you've picked up on filters. Your notes on Hereditary are neat - do you try to find tropes when you're watching movies?
** k0sh3k
*** Reading [[Music: Library]] reminded me to find [[Cantaloop|https://youtu.be/JwBjhBL9G6U]], which I've had running around my head for a few days now; I was into jazz rap/trip hop in the early '90s. It was the gateway drug to classic jazz for me. Ok, I can see the utility of Fire tagging, for your work, at least. You've had a lot of conversations with people this week. I think you might want to modify your note to MadameM and send it; she meant a lot to you, and even if she doesn't remember exactly, she'll appreciate being remembered. I do not appreciate how your self-descriptions reflect on me as your wife. I am not into grotesque manbeasts; you are not nearly as bad as you say you are.
** h0p3
*** [[h0p3]] has had a lot of serious conversations this week, and he's glad to have the opportunity. He's been luck to speak with so many folks about what matters. He's had a lot on his plate this week too, but it went pretty well. He didn't accomplish everything he [[hope]]ed (but, hey, what's new? :P). He's renamed his wiki (still at least a wiki) to ‚¶ó‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±: [[h0p3]]‚¶ò; we'll see how that sticks. He feels the grind, and it's going alright.
