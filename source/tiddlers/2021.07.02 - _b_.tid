I wish there was a sticky subthread at the top of every article-based thread for people who will openly claim to have read the entire article and are willing to defend that claim.

Learn From Your Trolling: masquerade as one of the current privileged class identities, say controversially stupid shit, 9/10 times simps will create a barrier around you to validate you and your falsehood, and anybody who disagrees with you will be ganged-up on. It was never about argumentation, only persuasion, and you generally won't "win" that battle against the simp-horde (though they can choose to do otherwise). That doesn't give us the right not to argue (recall what it means to respect the Reason in [[the other]]), but their defection often gives us the right (even the obligation, in some cases) to wield other tactics.

Is the dopamine hit from your anthropological curiosity about the ways in which people appear shitty fooling you into believing shitty people donâ€™t affect others or that we should put up with their shit? Of course, I agree: nobody knows what they are doing absolutely or with certainty. It's an important meme to check though, easily devolving into anti-realism. So, spit it wisely (and, I will remind the fauxgressive crypto-reactionaries: nice != kind).

Will start handing out parking tickets from satellite photos: just give me a taste of the tax. Happy to enforce whatever rules will make us money. It's sufficiently legal to be profitable, right? It was the laws of nature and the state of nature and state that you are responsible for that made me do it, people! What I do is always your fault. That doesn't sound abusive, does it?

Looking 4: cases in which private corporations are at least among the best possible stewards of any part of the commons.

Magic occurs when one has expended more energy to achieve a trick (or [[an illusion, Michael|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1WSH0VzoaM]]!), i.e. a masked passageway inside a mirror across a stage, than observers believe is reasonable.

Pay has almost nothing to do with how critical or important a job is to a society. Pay is largely the result of supply and the demands of the most privileged minority: capitalists and perhaps even those who can appear bourgeois to some [[dok]]. It appears scarcity is not a fundamental value, and the demands of the wealthy almost never pick out what objectively matters either.

Social cohesion is partially a result of largely [[shared]] mental states, including a canon of beliefs and desired [[end]]s. The consent of the social-contracted, however, doesn't have to be immorally manufactured. On the contrary, insofar as it is up to us, it should be mutually discovered, reconstructed, interpreted, and applied in reflective equilibrium.
