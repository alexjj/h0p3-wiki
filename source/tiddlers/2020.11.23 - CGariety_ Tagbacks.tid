Thanks for your kind note!

I had not heard of Geschwind Syndrome. It sounds very interesting indeed.

Cheers,

No problem! I wish I reached out to folks more often. I'm kinda a hermit. 

It is an interesting experience. Hypergraphia didn't hit me strongly until later in life. 

I penpal out in the open with folks. If that is something you would ever want to do, let me know. Sometimes I write at great length with people. Perhaps I would be a useful interlocutor for you, I don't know. In any case, I hope you continue to do such fine work.
