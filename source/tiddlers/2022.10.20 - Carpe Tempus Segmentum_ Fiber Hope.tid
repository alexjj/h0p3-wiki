title: 2022.10.20 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Fiber Hope

Woke at 3. Solid. Piss was good. Meditation. Reading //Alphabet of Thorn// to my sympaticon. Leftover pasta + //The Old Man// (of course, the flaws continue to build up) + [[TTTOTW]]. Solar company is wondering what happened to the energy efficiency inspection, and I told them we didn't want to lose the possibility of low-income assistance on it (which their method would force); I was initially told it didn't even matter if it happened or not.

Cleaning my mouse, thoroughly. Rubber has worn off everywhere over the years. Unfortunately, I killed it. =(. Bought another cheap one, since I know I like the feel of it. 

Woke at 12:30. Huge dreams. Got a bit more in. Hugs'n'bugs

Spent time looking at classes for next semester for mi amor. If nothing stands out, then prereqs. I still think independent studies could be outstanding. Noodles.

Mi amor sent me an e-mail from an ISP I aint never heard of offering fiber. No idea how they got her e-mail, but I'm glad they did. On the phone, the salesman couldn't answer my questions, and the papers he sent me didn't either (there was a petition for fiber she signed*). 2/3rds our current cost for 1gbit symmetric, and we can use our hardware (apparently). Scheduled. Stupidly excited. [[m16]] could use an SSD for racing on public trackers (extending the life of swarms and supercharging them) and eventually larger drives for long-term storage. 

Offspring came down to grind. Programming, economics, and MTG.

//The Walk// with mi amor. Bundled up. Clarinet. This conference was a huge waste of time, except it has opened a door to speak with a person in leadership who wants to know what she thinks. Dope. Policy development and picking good people are some of her exceptional talents. There are many things to speak about. Reggie gave me his number, wants me to come buy tools from him. Naw. Tomatoes. We were having a conversation, but it was clear he had no interest in listening for even 10 seconds. Beloved boomer garbage. Talked about how much capital he has gained on his house since he bought it, but refused to consider what younger generations are experiencing. Talked insurance and investment, and he's worried about losing his home eventually, even after death (discussed several death-related things). I decided not to suggest a trust, avoiding probate, etc.; he doesn't deserve to know, and he wouldn't listen even if I did speak.  

[[Family Gathering]] was delicious. We had kickasserhole. More talking then usual. //Mr. Robot//. 

[[TTTOTW]] and chilled with my sympaticon. //Skintime// with my sympaticon. Ice Cream + LoL Worlds + [[TTTOTW]].
