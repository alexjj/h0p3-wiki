In part, mass market media may be devoid of substance insofar as its appeal derives from removing what some people don't [[like]] instead of adding what some do. Surely, some of the most important pieces of media are hedonically polarizing (including being boring, unfun, or difficult) for this reason too. That people think the meaning of media is generally moreso in virtue of either its creation or consumption rather than what one does with that information or experience (which is hardly sufficient for explaining its meaning en toto either), is part of the problem, no doubt.

I would not be shocked to see more (though I don't claim many) faraday encaged rooms (themselves requiring improvements) with routers hardwired throughout a building to prevent or carefully leverage WLAN sensing. Embedded electrical control systems in buildings should grow significantly more complex for the wealthiest people on the planet.
