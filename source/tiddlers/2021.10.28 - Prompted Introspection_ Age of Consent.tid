title: 2021.10.28 - Prompted Introspection: Age of Consent

!! A 14-year-old has sex. How large does the age gap have to be between the 14-year-old and their partner before the child can no longer meaningfully consent to sex?

Your boogeyman casuistry continues, Samwise. Few can set aside their disgust to carefully parse the problem enough to recognize that our intuitions on the matter are a clusterfuck. Even Saint Oliver Sensen whose only critique of my teaching was that I didn't advance enough of my own position<<ref "w">> (even though I marshal others) in my classes refuses to advance his own on this topic. 

I'm interested in the consent of moral agency, not mere positive law. As such, age is a poor proxy variable inserted into a rule-of-thumb that doesn't acknowledge the underlying metaethical issues. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I was easily capable of consenting to have sex at 12 with anyone who wasn't intending to use me as mere means. I'm not saying it wasn't easy to take advantage of me, but, even as a gullible autistic person who was significantly abused and sheltered, I still had enough information and self-control to make competent choices with someone participating with me in [[good]] [[faith]]. Granted, most people are evil, and if the line is about maintaining human dignity and non-domination, and perhaps whether or not we have the right to try to trust people and be wrong about it, I have some bad news for you about the state of affairs. Age isn't a fundamental factor, and we can construct counterexamples all day here. We should be deeply concerned with [[power]] asymmetries, but that still isn't an autonomy or consent defeater simpliciter either. 

Is this what you want, Samwise? X may consent to ϕ with Y //iff// X and Y are acting upon a maxim that can be at least universalized as permissible. You mean to say we cannot consent to violate our or anyone else's dignity, the respect owed to all persons, and so forth, and so on, right? Is consent simply about the vague, ambiguous, or grey areas in which we don't already know what the CI computes? Is consent really about our ability to guarantee the political freedom to take risks and even possibly violate our own dignity when in disagreement with others? If you don't believe in libertarian freewill, then consent is irrelevant, of course. We're back in [[TOP]] territory. Even the definition of consent is something that must be intersubjectively discovered. It seems that consent, so often, has so little to do with the consenter/consentee, and more to do those who have been "granted" consent, especially given which conditions and intentions validate consent, which cannot be divorced from circumstances and other relationships more generally. It's not the age-gap that concerns me; it's the intentions of the agents and the initial Hohfeldian structures.
