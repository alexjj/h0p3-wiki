title: 2020.10.18 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: house_name = "The Asylum"

It's weird to see [[New]] so short and shallow. It's been a while since it felt that way. It's okay. I think I'm still just curling up. I also feel a drop in my cognitive and memory abilities. I'm even more retarded than usual. My brain is finally going to spiral out, surely. I feel slow. I don't feel like I'm losing it, but that's what someone who was losing it would say. hehe. I've heard that once I've studied the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, the results are no longer valid. I may fail it still some day. Ignunce is bliss, yo. I just need to work on maintaining my stupidity within a safe margin.

* //Our Walk// + 1-on-1s
** Hands were held, words were exchanged, multi-colored leaves and bouncing fatty tissues were admired.
** Was awesome to start it that way. I don't want to miss any walks!
* Reading The Wikis
** It did not go well for my offspring.
*** My son even had to take a break. No bueno. I hear ya.
* [[JRE]] Called
** Didn't have much to tell me, but he had more to say with the offspring, which was cool. 
** He was done with his walk with his son, and he had a lot to do.
** He's concerned there's more aluminum than we know. That is a good point. Need to figure out what we can do about that.
* Reading The Wikis
** The adults had fun. Best part is that I get to be serious in thinking about her work, and mine is something to laugh at.
*** Plus, I can predict her posts. =).
**** Also, I got in trouble for guessing that my daughter was on her period. I have no sense of smell, but I do aim to make sense of attitudes backing shitty arguments.
* [[DeathOfRobinhood]] and his wife shared the evening with us.
** He led the conversation for us all. May he lead many more.
*** I'm [[grateful]]. It's not my talent.
*** I'm sure he's been told it many times: he's gonna be an amazing father.  
** We got to hear everyone's voices together. It was surreal for me. It was very pleasant, and wandering. 
** Vaporwave. Cannot word.
** Incoherently spoke about incoherence. 
** Selah is a prolific journaler. 
** They've been helping out their parents.
** It's cool how [[DeathOfRobinhood]] knows the stories of everyone in my family. He knows what's eatin' me.
** Will be leaving Signal and Discord up for [[Family Time]]. Super glad we got to join our houses for the evening.
* [[Family Log]]
** Plus cuddles.

We started [[Family Time]] later, and it worked fine. [[TTP]]s are less necessary. They know exactly what the adults think, formally, accountably. Scary fucking part about being a dad. This isn't some fucking game where I don't give a shit who loses and who wins. Every step I see them take, I see consequences thundering through their decades of possible life. Can't be fun to deal with an asshole like that. Success isn't up to me. Hold my breath. Catch what I can.
