With perhaps even more recession (maybe even stagflation) projected in the coming year or two given looming bond yield curve inversion, it remains unclear if the bullet will be bitten; will those in more direct [[power]] of the US government stop fraudulently deficit spending to redistribute wealth to the wealthiest, and, likewise, will the Fed really stop debasing the currency to similar effect (The Fed, of course, is just a proxy scapegoat for capitalists in the underlying principal-agent problem)? See, we're doing something, we're helping! That's a cycle I'm not convinced will break in a constructive manner.
