title: 2021.04.05 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Vehicular Transport

Chilled with my broski, talked blackboxes, then he vaped and I ate chips while we watched some LolVod.

[[TTTOTW]], Fireman Time!, hunting for a vehicle, finishing my logs.

Sleep early^^tm^^, sleep hard. Noises on machine, hoping it was my intruder, but it wasn't. `/sigh`. Messages, good. Rumination.

Heard her coming into the cave, we squinted at each other (dork) for a while until she decided to join me. //Skintime//, slacking off (as she should). Lots on the docket. [[Morning Routine]], Hugs'n'bugs. Assignments for github key work and upgrading our scripting; son is shadowing and doing what he can to help (and, he's in charge of his own). 

Joined the adults. Cracked her back and her neck was tight, gave her tiny massage. Maybe a big one is in order. Didn't want one though. Just after suggesting early in the morning that FB was worth leaving to [[Scout]], my wife demonstrated the value of maintaining a connection just to the economies and local news hubs that run inside FB. My searches are wildly incomplete, and FB has such a high rate of immediate responses from real people (that is not nothing, especially as I wander plenty of ghostly corners in the world - ofc, FB can be supplanted and ought be). Lots of vehicles that can only be found through this venue, and far less spam. It's obvious things move fast on it too, within hours here with the stimulus money.

Traveled, tried 3 vehicles, and the last one seemed reasonable to me (we'll see). $2500, Saturn, 127k, sounded decent. Felt like a chopshop, seller said we could put any price we wanted down on the paperwork cause...cash (thx bro, you know how it do, but my wife is as straightedge as they come). Bigger vehicle than she wants, but it feels decent. Thinking about our tiny front yard, probably will go to making the entire thing a parking lot. Eventually, there may be 5-6 vehicles at this house. Also, we have almost no cash on hand now. Need to withdraw. 

//Skintime//, breathing and chilling, Assisted Fireman Time! Life is good. 

[[Family Gathering]]. We had (this is the official term for this experiment): Fancy Hodge Podge. Curry Pork reminded me of Thailand, patties of sticky rice, my brother's excellent fresh pickled veggies, and quinoa salad. I even had a soda. We stuffed ourselves. He's dehydrated chilis to make his own spices (and it kicks). My offspring armwrestled. In a few years, I doubt I'll be able to beat my own son if he decides to work out.

Nap is lap, then got too hot, and hit the bed. Slept so hard. She couldn't sleep (I'm just too noisy). Wife has been feeling anxious again.
