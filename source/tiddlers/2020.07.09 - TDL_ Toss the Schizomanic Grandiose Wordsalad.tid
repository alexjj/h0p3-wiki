* They need to take the dolly, bring back the expensive tools and the battery (might as well have them talk me to double check), finalize the campsite, and come back. Walkie+Talkies need to be put back too, as well as the charger.
* Rooms aren't done. It's gotta happen.
* Vapelyfe. Enjoy, sir.
* Graft
* We don't have shows we want to watch, and I get the feeling my wife really needs shows. 
** I want shows that don't make me want to kill myself as we watch them, and she needs shows that make her not want to kill me. This seems to get harder with age.
** Maybe what my wife could use is an offline friend. But, nobody is going to do that with her right now, understandably (and it's super hard to find someone to fit her). While I don't understand it (especially the cost), she could use a drinking buddy.
*** She's missing church so much. My hiki life is not for her. 
** She's anxious, somewhat blue, tired. It's not as bad as it was a year ago, but her affect moves toward it. 
*** She doesn't feel stuck though, and the offspring are doing better.
