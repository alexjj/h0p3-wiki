title: The Book of Impassionata

//"[A]s much as I hate to endorse anything which tastes slightly of [[gnosticism|Straussian]], this isn't a place that can hold [your] hand...I don't ~~expect~~ [confidently predict] that anything I could say would constitute engaging with your argument in your view, but...You don't know me, and your words haven't known me. [[Hope]] is for the unseen...I have met you online, I am reading your words, I know you better than someone who has said nothing...it doesn't matter to me what you say you are if you've internalized Christ's teachings so thoroughly...maybe sleep on it and then reread this conversation from the beginning...(so it goes. don't let it trouble you.)"//

** "I write this way because I realized that legible writing can only address legible topics."
*** "[L]egible meaning is an illusion of the people who believe that communication is possible."
**** "If you can't understand me already I can't explain more."
***** "[Y]ou might not be in my target audience."
*** "I'm not sure what you think I preach or don't preach but I speak my mind and it's nothing personal."
**** "I just engage in this hyperstitional act of speaking my own desire into the void."
***** "I didn't actually read your walls of text because it was clearly about you and your struggle, whatever that is. You can fling shit from your mountaintop but you can't make me care...I hope writing all of that was helpful for you but I'm a discerning enough reader to recognize that this isn't about me at all, no matter how hard you try to tell me it is."
****** "and the people who are actual fascists? their only ideology is power: what that means, very specifically, is that they are not interested in dialogue. they will hide behind dialogue as a performance, an empty performance. they will talk as long as you will let them, and at some point you just can't let them."

** "To what have all your online postings contributed?"
*** "Difficult conversations to have. I don't pretend to be good at it, I post anonymously online to practice."
**** "[T]he problem hasn't ever been seeing the opportunity, it's putting text to page at the right time without any of the religious bullshit. Writing without the ego. Thus, pseudonymous. Thus, a manifesto on a domain."
**** "My only point is that this focus on virtual politics is a distraction. Online isn't real life. Online isn't real life. Online isn't real life."
***** "I'm a crank, but if the only contribution I ever made was critical, I would have added nothing to the community and I would have been wasting my time."
****** "[Y]ou need to be the wave, you know? win elections, take the levers. it's that simple. there's no grand system. there's no megalomania...but that's hard work and the heroism urge isn't satisfied by it: thus, posting online...I'm just not going to pretend I'm doing anything by posting here but providing a map for those who come after me. This is a Debord shrine. That's good. That's useful."

** "Impassionata's been a fun write. I'm not quite done but I've decided to truly retire and I think it can happen this year. And I'm sad to say that one reason I want to kill the name is I don't want any sort of association with the SFBA Rationalists."
*** "No one cares what logic you use to justify your association with a shitty cesspool."
**** "I have spent maybe 4% of my time on Reddit on SRD, I go in and out."
***** "Honestly this is as good a use of time online as any amount of reddit comment writing."
**** "I don't understand why people don't care that other people don't care that other people don't care. Shouldn't the internet just be disdainful, pointed silence in all matters?"
*** "When everything you've ever done online is posture about who is a loser and who isn't, mock other people for having serious opinions or feelings, and lean real hard into the idea that cool is not giving a shit, and the harder you don't give a shit the cooler you'll be, all becomes theatrics."
**** "I think you're missing the point, frankly, in your fit of leftist crit. You've got the litany down. Good job. I acknowledge my privilege and that we are living on tribal land, there, have I performed the counter-ritual to your performative theatrics?"

*** "But running a publicity venue is just practical work. The real question is just what to say. Remember when we had talk of starting up a zine? I just can't think what I'd want to put in it."
**** "My point about online politics is that this sense of urgency isn't connected to the opportunity for accomplishment."
***** "[T]he curse of politics is the sense that you must act now, or else. Recognizing the curse is the key to dissipating it, and calmly accepting that the path which lies before us will not involve being recognized for our work, but doing the work which is unrecognized."
*** "Unless you manage to hit the right extremely influential and intelligent notes, a Chomsky for instance, you have no staying power as a public persona, it's impossible. You will eventually be drawn into making a public statement on a controversial topic and it will cost you fans = votes...if you think that being a public intellectual is anything but political well you have some reading to do on the inherent intrusion of politics to all of human attention: that which people see is political."
**** "If you get involved with local politics and make real world progress, you see firsthand just how empty and idiotic online political discussion is, and I feel more like an observer, an anthropologist studying the rituals of a cult that performs the symbols of intellectualism without understanding any of the meaning of those symbols."
***** "[T]o be a political activist in a meaningful sense is to volunteer your time and energy in a meaningful way. that means doorbelling for a campaign. or volunteering at a domestic abuse shelter. it means turning off the internet and going out into the real world. it means testifying at your local government. of course you can't see a difference between online politics and politics: you don't even know what real politics is! don't require me to join you in your delusion."
****** "I'm writing bathroom scrawl but at least I know it."
******* "And you're here eating our shit. What does that make you?...Again, eat our shit. Continue eating our shit. You know it's shit and yet you keep eating it."

** "The best part of writing online is not taking yourself seriously."
*** "The inability to take things seriously is a sign of irony poisoning."
**** "I can't take seriously anyone who posts twitter-length smug. (because they don't take their own words/power seriously enough to articulate something worth reading, so how could I take them seriously?)"
***** "Now if you slow down and speak plainly and concisely, what's your problem with me other than I was smug at you once? What is it you think I believe that's so wrong?"
*** "You will never write anything worth reading if you think it doesn't matter what image of you your readers conjure up based on your words. It's literally your only job as a writer to make that image accurate. What you think you meant only matters if you partake of writing as a solipsistic exercise in justifying your own reality or whatever."

** "Like talk about wearing your insecurities on your sleeve."
*** "I have this sudden suspicion you can't create anything because your inner critic is too strong so you self suffocate. But your creative urge isn't satisfied, so you come here to look at uninhibited expression. You're jealous of it. That a person could engage in activity you take yourself too seriously to ever attempt. So you become the critical voice because you sabotaged your own faculties. Sad story. Many like it."
**** "Nothing like the duel of more enlightened than thou, the high holiness standoff, the gnostic didgeridoo."
***** "win more smart edgy internet philosopher points"
****** "You aren't transcending anything. You're propagating it."
******* "You need a guru badly lmao"
******** "You only write weak comments full of smug. You're not that interesting."
********* "Lmao ok dude have a good time on your enlightenment kick"
*** "You are belittling the same thing you are doing: it is clear and evident self-hatred. You are abusing yourself. You are angry at yourself for being here on this website, and you are taking it out on other people."
**** "What you mean is that your egotistical and narcissistic need to feel important and change the system in some grand and dramatic way can't handle its failure."
***** "Cope harder, you're still here posting worthless crap to someone you openly disdain. You extremely online loser...what you emit becomes what you actually are."
****** "You're a piece of shit not because I think you intend to be an asshole, but because you keep on telling me your shit is honey. I'm telling you it's shit."
*** "[W]ow. you went on to do a super smug PARAGRAPH PARAGRAPH PARAGRAPH smug, so. as far as I'm concerned you're lying to yourself hard. now I may be smug but I know it and I'll own it, and I speak with firmness but /shrug. you're involved in a performance of anger that has nothing to do with me. later."

** "There is no need to belittle people for writing something they wanted to write. Think about it."

** "I don't get caught in obvious epistemic moron traps like this."
*** "We've let politeness and not-wanting-to-make-a-scene keep some of the rhetoric off the table that needs to be on the table."
**** "I've been conversing in Internet forums for years and freedom of speech doesn't mean protection from bullying...Bullying works. It's unfair, it's immoral, it's what we are, and it's better than war."
***** bullying works. deplatforming works. you just have to be a bit smarter than to hold to an ideal of free speech absolutely in the belief that this will save you from having to handle the mass trash they can put out because if you just let them speak they will speak as long as they can."
****** "Sir this is an internet forum. Take your egoic excretions elsewhere, they're inferior and you're demeaning yourself."
******* "if you are so pointlessly critical of work here on this INTERNET FORUM again, displaying such a grotesque failure to apply conscience to context I will be here again yapping at you to SHUT THE FUCK UP"
******** "If people writing things bothers you as 'self-important' then you're in the wrong place because this is where any person who can string two words together can post them. Chill out a bit. I'm not professing this is Shakespeare, I'm just sharing a thought."

** "I regret engaging this person who is functionally illiterate."
*** "You're insufferable and illiterate. You should shut up more, read more, and think more before you speak...I don't know if you can unlearn your conversational style. Your teachers failed you that this is your response."

** "You're a bit of a shithead and you should shut up and listen instead of getting prissy and huffy"
*** "Man you are bitter and washed up."
**** "if that cheap shot is all you have to say you aren't worth my time"
***** "Have some pride and stop huffing boomer dementia farts."
****** "Yeah that's another symptom, spamming your joylessness. You strike me as someone at serious risk of heavy irony poisoning. Consider deleting your online accounts and leaving online life. Because the way you relate to me shows that you're incapable of having a serious conversation. There actually is something wrong with the way you process the world. Don't inflict it on others."
******* "You're not witty you're just being an asshole...You're not witty you're just being an asshole...This is it, this is the deflection, the defense mechanism, of those called out for their behavior. 'I'm just being ironic, it's a form of wit.' Dude your comments are garbage."
******** "You're an online troll man not an interlocutor of any merit"

** "Oh I'm not angry, I'm contemptuous...The way you relate to other people online is broken."
*** "You're like one of the least effective of God's chosen preachers I've seen though. You treat the people you talk to with such contempt. People chose to follow Christ whose Word you disdain. You're going nowhere, amped up with testosterone for a fight you're sure you'll have but all you are doing is performing your story to try and convince yourself. (Because it matters that you can't convince anyone else you know.)"

** "God you're a fucking rude twat...You have no understanding of my point of view."
*** "Listen man I got nothing to work with but what you put down. You are not winning points by telling me I got you wrong. I don't care, I give up. To a certain extent it's your problem if you are misunderstood and we are at that point now."

** "Your narrative does not magically make other narratives explode."
*** "Tiptoeing around defining reality to avoid offending people is dumb stupid."
*** "I think meta-modernism is a look back longingly at modernism."
**** "[T]he historical truth is still real."
**** "When there are no good options everyone's plans become foolish."
***** "'All religious beliefs are bad' isn't a conclusion I'm prepared to grant as basis for an argument. It's a religious statement because it's categorically moral. (It's not that you can't have morality outside of religion, but if you state religiously, as an assumption, that all religious beliefs are bad I will say that it is at least true of that religious belief!)"
***** "I guess I just trust the author of the I Ching not to have put anything that would set someone on the wrong path...the ideal thing about the I Ching, for me, is that there is only this true randomness at the heart of being guided to a reading. That's the will of the universe."
***** "[O]h I don't have any problem seeing aspects of God, I'm just inclined to view it as a quasi-polytheistic state of affairs. But so what if it's quasi-polytheistic? I'd rather have a god-prophet than a prophet between me and God."
***** "I'll be honest, once I read Debord I haven't had much use for philosophy. I'll admit to being a fan of Zizek for his odd moment of puissance but what is there to say, really, about existence? better to just engage in it."

** "[T]ruth to me is a process of checking and double-checking assumptions."
*** "[I]f you are trying to solve/perfect grand systems you've taken a wrong turn."
**** "The existence of wrong people, however misguided their intentions, does not make truth impossible. It just means you have to be skeptical of people pushing this kind of postmodern uncertainty."

** "I think the closest to depicting a universality is: the tao that can be spoken is not the tao."
*** "an interesting thesis but marred...there is such a thing as truth you know"
*** "Words are a limitation. Meaning is nonverbal, an association."
**** "I don't know I tend to disregard the labels of things because it doesn't matter what people think they're doing, what matters is the function of the form."
***** "You might believe you can transcend these petty human labels, but that is a clever solipsism on your part."
****** "The universe is absurd because the choices we make matter in the sense of determining where we end up tomorrow."
******* "You've been able to experience the illusion of choice, and now you're coming to understand that it was only an illusion, and only for some."

** "Beauty as an external source of meaning provides a foundation again."
*** "I think you're making the error of believing in a single standard of beauty. The point is merely that people who talk about beauty a lot are talking about their own feelings as a source of objective grounding."
**** "This isn't insight. In fact it's anti-insight."

** "If you're the person at prom saying 'The crown is only as important as the importance it is accorded' you're spectating instead of participating which is to say you are the spectacle. You are the mechanism which convinces you that the plot isn't real."
*** "[W]hat makes Christ divine isn't what he was, but what people see in Him."
**** "'What made Jesus divine was the friends he met along the way:)', heck I'll cosign that statement."
**** "The purpose of faith is not factual accuracy. The purpose of faith is radical transformation, in particular, of the self. What people see in Him, and then make of what they see in their own construction of their lives: that is God."
***** "[W]orship has this transmutative power you see. worship: the repetition of his words. their belief that He was divine was immanent in their actions. they formed a religion around Him. and worshiped Him. and thus made him God."
****** "[Y]es, 'all it takes to be made a god is people worshipping you'."
******* "It's a free country, believe what you want!"
******** "Now stop trying to construct your grand map of what people mean and holding them to a rigor of your own doomed making. 1) I don't give a shit about you or your system of ideas, and 2) The way you approach politics tells me you're trying too hard to make sense of it all. There is no perfect political theory or movement, no consistency of philosophies."
********* "I don't think you're capable of understanding outlooks, just categorizing them in your own cosmology in a simulacrum of understanding."
********** "It's a solipsism because you choose to remove yourself from the conscious experience of others."
*********** "You are not free of the illusions because you can point them out. You are, in fact, then trapped in the illusionary reality you have hallucinated."
*** "And I'm not saying you must bow down to the prom queen, must wish her well, must partake in a ritual of youth...but you absolutely must not think yourself superior, as you so clearly do, for 'seeing through' the ritual."

* __Yet Another "If I Can't Be One, No One Can" Broken, Ex-Gnostic-Messiah-Wannabe's [[Stoic]] Pragmatism__

** "[W]atching someone's mind explode with messianic delusions has a way of making you think about the wisdom of anyone seeking enlightenment."

** "The desire to shape the world is naive foolishness."
*** "The desire for the power of forbidden knowledge creates the belief in secret knowledge, and that those who seek it have attained it. The fear of the power of novel interpretation compels the secretive to the belief they are Elect. So it has been for all spiritual traditions. Not harmful in moderation, perhaps. But the reality is knowledge has no transformative power. 'The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls.'"
*** "Socialism is an attempt to codify community which generally fails the same way all human imitations of nature fail."
*** "[O]ne of my favorite protest chants was 'make racists afraid again.' The myth that misguided people just need someone to talk to them in a calm and reasonable voice has died."
*** "[W]e should reform what we can reform. Let not the impossibility of replacing the system with a radical transformation stop us from doing the achievable out of spite. This is something I feel I struggle against here from time to time: limiting the scope of attempted action."

** "[I]dealism must be grounded, firmly, repeatedly, and in some cases harshly, in realism."
*** "[P]uncture the balloons of the messianic...[for they] must be turned, swiftly, to the practical."
**** "Oh it's a Christ Aspirant. I've been expecting another wave. 1) Your team isn't coming. 2) You failed the test."
***** "Your miracle is making whine."

** "I used to feel the vigor of setting one's self against those things which cannot be moved."
*** "You can try and crap out a higher vision that will unite the tribes. Or you can accept that you are a small part of a larger machine of conflicting narratives that will never make sense...There are no perfect words, there is no perfect vision, this is not the starting place for a revolution."
**** "[N]othing could keep people on the same page because man is inherently alone!, and it is a rare glimpse at another human being without some manner of miscommunication occurring. In this miscommunication lies the spectacle. This is what it is so hard to get to the would-be messiahs. That your message can't get through."
***** "[W]hat you get when you combine an invisible, omnipresent malevolence clamping down on humanity as we sear ourselves to death and the emergence of an adolescent male (most of them are male) into that environment, deprived of a spiritual tradition but connected to the Internet, is a whole bunch of vision quests to hell sometimes ending in your bog standard messiah complex."
****** "The spectacle doesn't absorb religious figures, the spectacle is what makes you believe the spectacle can and has absorbed religious figures...It has to be reified so people can see it, and then deconstructed so people don't take it too seriously."

* __On Freedom: Abusively Reinforcing An Autological Spectacle About [[The Spectacle]], Methodical Gnostic Myths, & Subversively Spoutcasting Agency-Robbing Hypotheses__ 

** "The spectacle is a useful myth with real properties."
*** "[T]he spectacle is that which makes you believe in the inauthentic."
*** "There is no breaking free from the spectacle. The spectacle, insomuch as 'it' exists, is a total force this way."
**** "[Y]ou can't oppose the spectacle. That's the whole point of studying it...the spectacle is the set of forces that take that event and make it incomprehensible."


*** "[T]he spectacle is that which makes you believe man is controlled."
**** "Man is not controlled in that the things it is natural for a man to want: food, a woman, the agency accorded by political speech, they are available to him, and he may embark upon the journey of the creation of the self within these realms to the fullest extent. Furthermore, man is not controlled in the degree of the insanity of that political speech, resulting in a general postmodern confusion percolating in a miasma."
***** "It is the spectacle that convinces man to want more than food and shelter and family. The talk of control is had by people who don't understand: it was never in our control. We have always been here gathering food and making babies."
****** "Man is not controlled in any meaningful fashion. Man simply is the mass movement of monkeys with chainsaws and guns and tribalistic politics and shiny new things generating a perpetual becoming-capitalism, this, the gleaming trash pit of the edifice of our ruin."
**** "Will humankind stop at nothing in its desire to be controlled by something somewhere?"
***** "The spectacle isn't in charge so much as it is a strong inertia."
****** "The spectacle isn't an affliction of modernity, modernity is just an amplification of a natural human tendency to tell the story of our lives as they unfold...the point of reading this bleak book on the prognosis for meaningful social change against the systemic indifference of the mass population is so you can stop trying impossible things. try only possible things. especially realistic, achievable ones."


*** "...The accumulated forces of spectacle, the contradictions inherent in capitalism, these are one and the same. Heteronormativity is spectacle. Human operating system, a hive mind badly tuned...The spectacle doesn't exist, there's nothing to be angry at."
**** "[T]he belief that you cannot escape the strictures of mass culture is itself a spectacular artifact, a falsehood with enough truth in it to carry weight among the learned."
***** "There will still be meaningless pop culture dominating the airwaves but if we can attack the corporate death grip on our society we could imagine a better future for once."


***** "Never forget: the propaganda works because it is effective. If you're watching it, it's a message for you. You cannot escape the spectacle. You can only attempt to transcend it, and strip the trappings of status from your life as best the humble servant of the faith, whatever faith that might be, can."
***** "The biggest problem I have with this place is people in it often seem to believe that by identifying spectacular forces we can live free of them, or enter into a reality beyond them. And this is nonsense. We're not above any of it."


** "The spectacle wins not when you pay for a popular artist but when you stop listening to music because you're too afraid to be seen enjoying yourself because you had allowed your perception to be clouded by imaginary status games."
*** "The spectacle wins when people cannot tell an earnest recommendation from a paid ad. To see the ad in all things is only a beginning of wisdom."

** "yes marketers want to control what people buy, but no amount of marketing can actually force people to buy something they don't actually want...yes war profiteers want to populate the media with war drum messaging, but the American people are also just really warlike...the truth is that the American people hear about a potential war and say 'yeah sounds good' and this is true throughout all of our history...every would-be god of the screen is fighting for the almighty eyeball, but that's the point: it doesn't take men in labs to design the perfect eye candy it just takes enough writers chasing eyeballs and the attention-grabbing ones grab attention. that's it. that's the sum of the machination of the human mind...the spectacle is above and beyond the whim of individuals, of individual organizations, of banks and riches."
*** "if they depict the young female from their position of prominence in culture as they were already instinctively doing, they could make shitloads of money...the mythologization of the divine feminine only works if you can tell the perfect myth, and every generation retells its myths. Arguably Frozen is the most successful work of Disney ever created. You have to cater to exactly the desires of the audience. Disney is the slave. The master dynamic, the idea that populations could be mastered and steered, is an agency-robbing mythos...No one is control. No thing is in control. The properties of the egregores let loose upon the world in the form of corporations are merely processes operating, not control itself...Why do people not take the levers of power into their own hands? Because they don't want to. Movements fail before the heteronormative enclave: if you want to have babies that's pretty much all you're going to have time to do and this politics stuff is a sideshow to your main life. So movements get a chance to articulate a message to the mass screaming masses and put a conversation into everyone's life, but that's about it. Frustrated by the powerlessness they realized when they saw this mass indifference, people have reacted in various ways. One of them is to blame a vast nexus of "the elite" who control the conversation from behind the scenes, media manipulation. But the media manipulation that the public believes exists isn't the media manipulation to be worried about: the stories that are told are invariably only stories rich people want told. And the media manipulation that exists only reflects the desires of the people who consume it. It's not a control structure, it's just a reflection. There were people who were upset at the way OWS got reported on, believing it to be a campaign of mainstream sabotage, but that was a deflection of the people who wanted the story told their way and didn't like the way that people viewed them. These people are similar to those upset at the way /r/antiwork got reported on. It's not sabotage for you to have to think about how your movement is presented. It's just the reality of the vast noise introduced by having so many people around."
**** "the stories disney produces are all heartwarming heteronormative contract comedy-tragedies because that's the best state propaganda can do: try to nudge people to make slightly more ethical choices...I don't think that's intricate intervention personally, just the machine attempting to regulate itself, badly, while it leaks money all over some executives who really ought to ask themselves if they're worth their paycheck."

The lie is that there is but one demon to vanquish or banish or transfigure-into-the-benign (many demons feed on the conflict you might throw at them), but they number in the thousands for sufficiently advanced pain and must be handled one at a time. The religions stress regular ritual for healing for this reason."
**** "But there's a reason people practice ritual in groups. I don't know if I believe it 'enhances' the power in some linear/mathematical fashion, it's not mechanical like that. The point is that you can't get a thing if that thing isn't where you are, and if where you are is an online forum there's actually a lot you can get but there's so much you, a human in a body, cannot from this the real virtual."

** "I speak of spiritual sterility and say that this is the problem of our time which can also be solved. The absence of spiritual stories means that all one needs to do is tell the deeply spiritual stories."
*** "[N]ow you are, spiritually, where we were when it all began. you develop an oral tradition around the likes of Carl Sagan. you develop a respect for the numinous and often a general humanism. this is the re-becoming of religion. and in a Christian culture, what emerges as a result is a sort of muted Christianity without the belief in the supernatural."
**** "[I]f a tree claims it's a goose but operates under the principles of a tree, is it not still a tree? regardless of what you say you believe about God, if you function as a Christian human what are you really. did you think being a Christian was about going to church? did you think being a Christian was about prayer? most atheists end up sighing and picking up their personal cross, the responsibility of their life to the well-being of others. thus: a tree grows leaves regardless of what it says it is."

** "[A]ll ideologies fail to become perfect reflections of the dreams of their origination. atheism gets stereotyped all the time, as deservedly as the Christian stereotypes. that doesn't mean the core criticism of religion at the heart of atheism holds no weight, and I would be a fool to treat the stereotype of atheism as the fundamental nature of atheism itself."
*** "[Y]ou think too much because you think it matters what people say online, but the vast majority of people aren't paying attention in this way, that they grade ideologies. you take ideologies too seriously...don't muddy the waters, logician, your powers have no importance here in politics!"
*** "I used to think that it mattered what atheists labeled the thing they pointed to in order to find motivation to persevere in the face of such a gaunt and unholy reality, and then I realized that mostly anti-theistic behavior was anger at the particular religion the angry atheists of the day grew up in, not at the thing I have tended to call God. I thought atheists were confused and needed a nudge towards God, but what they needed was to vent about their experience with religion. God takes care of the questioners in Its own special way."
*** "For many atheists, online participation functions as a religious activity. What do you call it when people discount the stated lived experience of religious people in order to hallucinate their own understanding of events over that experience so as to interject their own dissatisfaction with religion? I call that religious behavior, personally. It's creative story-telling with a clear and obvious grudge. You don't have to believe that God spoke to a dude on the side of the street but if you are triggered into a long rant on how religion rotted his brain (when he likely didn't have much of a brain to begin with) you might have a problem."
*** "So you're telling me that you routinely, knowingly, habitually, and daily spend effort and exertion contemplating God out of a robust and earnest love for humans and the human project and you think you aren't doing it out of love? You think you aren't doing it with your heart? You think you aren't doing it with your very soul? You are so hung up on this "God" word. You think it matters whether there is some entity out there that you obey or worship affirmatively. But worship is what you do. Unlearn what you have learned about this 'God' word. You think you are violating the commandment to love thy God but you are in constant affirmation of the principle behind the commandment. You tell me you don't love God but your every behavior, as you describe it, is nothing but love. You just become preoccupied with whether or not God exists without considering what you create with your worship. That's the part I don't claim to understand. You think it matters what you say you don't believe when you spend your days in righteous meditation on the eternal divine mysteries, wrapped in the enigma of love and strident and sure in your ritual movement. Just because you say it isn't worship doesn't make it so. Look past the word God and into the wellspring of being and joy of all life."
**** "So to what extent is your concern with God that It isn't a real life superhero with powers of omni? To me it seems like you're taking the fan fiction too literally. If God is a real life superhero, why should It have the powers you expect it to have? I am a Christian atheist because I don't believe there is a superhero god, but I do believe in the power of worship and I think the human Christ is a man whose words and deeds are worth modeling my life after. It's not about what is real, it's about faith's place in human psychology."

**** "I believe that secular humanists are lying to themselves about the origin of their beliefs, and that's a petty, small thing to do; but further than that it's an intellectual dishonesty. We're not better than the story of our religion. We're not better than Christians of ages past because of some words written since then. I have as much in common with an early Christian as I do an enlightenment thinker, and if a belief causes me to believe that I have nothing in common and could not break bread with my common ancestor, that belief is severing me from this shared humanity. If the only difference between you and me is that I wear a cross and you look down on those who wear crosses--and I'm not saying you do--I'm going to claim that I've got the better end of the deal."
***** "There's a lot of desperate souls who need spiritual guidance. There's a lot of poverty, a lot of homelessness, a lot of criminals. There you will find the power of the Living Word of Christ that you mock, but you won't find secular humanists soothing the spiritual wounds of the downtrodden. Your problem with Christianity is just that it isn't what you thought it was or hoped it would be, but it's very real and very alive: it offers people a second chance, it offers people a spiritual path in the trying times. For you religion is politics. Mundane. You're here on this board debating religion as you exercise this grudge. People believe in Christianity because it gives them something when nothing else will. But it's not intellectually satisfying to serve the spiritual needs of men and women whose problems are innumerable. That's hard spiritual practice. Too much for the lightweight atheists who care more about being right than being good. And that's why I wear the cross. Because you think Christianity is history in your blindness to its actual activity, admiring your 'movement' in the mirror of history without doing the work or even really understanding what the work is."
****** ""the opposite of christianity" is a clunky phrasing that doesn't mean anything IMO. when you say you aren't religious what you mean is you don't attend church or affirmatively accept the teachings of any particular Christian sect...when I say you are spiritually in the same place as humans first discovering their place in Creation and developing an oral tradition around that place, what I mean is that this is religion: the development of scheduled practice, meditation, communication around the 'divine' aka 'existence' aka 'being,' which was not done by you but to you, not by any particular god in the sky but by that which is. having rejected the edifice of the religions which came before, atheists have no choice but to develop an edifice. you are laying bricks tinged with the holiness of your being. that you refuse to call them holy doesn't make them less spiritually significant, it's just a peculiarity of your spiritual upbringing." 
******* "I don't care what you say you are if what you do is perform the Christian morality wholly. you can recognize a false Christian, I can recognize a false atheist."

** "Religions of the world say look within. If you get caught there, looking within, turn to Christ. There will be a way for Him--which is to say, the-impact-He-has-had-on-the-world -- the myth above the man but also with the man!, to save you--not from the perils of the mortal world, but from making a mistake that might injure your soul. Or so it has always been for me. This is the necessity of the Trinity, to stitch all the God together. It's a hack job done by people who just knew what they had was better than what they had before Christ. Doctrinal conflicts eventually split the church apart, but it was divided from the beginning. Christianity is that which pervades."
