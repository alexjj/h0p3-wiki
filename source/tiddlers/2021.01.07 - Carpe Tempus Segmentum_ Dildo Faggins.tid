* //The Walk//
** The best of part my day. 
* It was obvious they didn't try. Asked my daughter if she's been using Discord, and then asked her if she's was lying 3 times before she decided to tell the truth. My daughter and I can barely be in the same room at this point.
* Ate dinner downstairs
** Bacon, pancakes, and coffee
* Cleaned & Organized
** Moved kitty litter back down since my offspring aren't doing their jobs. Might as well make it as easy as I can on them.

* Put my wife to bed
** It's true: I only get along with her in a lot of cases.

** Weeping. I know the feeling. He's gettin' crushed. That feeling like he's failing, starting over, like it's just going to keep happening again and again. 
** He did get the job. Long interview. 
** Thought about options.
** A bowl and some sleep for him.
* Try To Take Over The World
