Welp, time to try to figure out what's wrong. It's going to get tight after the downpayment, assuming we do.

* Read+Write
* Been a while since I cared about points on MyAnon. Size is irrelevant. Going for quantity. Will see. Still 5k away from 90k for the invite.
* Stepping through the Cryosleep list by hand now. I've missed one.
** Can't find it though.
* [[TW Canvassing]]
* Read+Write
* Tried sleep by 5:30?... didn't click until 7 in bed.
** Apparently, once I went out, I was out out (which is rare).
* Woke at 1
** Damn good sleep. 
* [[Morning Routine]]
** Exercise continues
* Offspring and I talked
* Prepped dinner
* Walk With Offspring
** Wanderings
** My daughter noticed Howard changing his stance/formation to get it over with. Who wants to talk to a crazy person? I know. 
** Sounds like there was effort, although the school discussions were short.
* Walk With My Light In The Dark Forest
* //Skintime//
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Ribs, asparagus, apples, coffee
** Presidential Debate
*** Looks much better for Biden.
*** Tried [[Fitness Routine]] again, but then I decided I just wanted to sit and watch with folks. 
*** On advice of counsel, I did not play a drinking game. Vapelyfe instead.
* Read+Write+Walk+Talk

Felt like a short day. I spent the latter part of it with muh peeps though.
