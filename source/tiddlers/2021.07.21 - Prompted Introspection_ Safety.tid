title: 2021.07.21 - Prompted Introspection: Safety

!! At the gut level, do you feel that the world is safe or not safe?

This is poorly defined, and you'll get just as poor an answer for it too. For whom, to what [[dok]], regarding, and so forth? My answer will usually be "no." I don't think nature is safe in general; it takes serious work to survive it well. Further, I think the vast majority of adult humans are terrible people, and they make it a dangerous place. Even if you survive, you're going to be enslaved to varying [[dok]] by the humans around you. Life's a risk, and, I think we're morally obligated to risk our lives for the sake of [[others]]. Most forms of safety are not the highest priority (but, that itself is a safety problem too). I don't predict that I or my offspring will live to old age, but I also don't think we're likely to pursue a bourgeois life. Maybe we'll get [[lucky]] though.
