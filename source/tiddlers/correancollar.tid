>> `/nod`. In any case, I appreciate your response. Thank you for the time again, madame [[correancollar]].

> i don't know. i don't think we have a set prescription

>> I think that may be a loaded phrase. Why is that the (or a*) fitting prescription?

> go outside

What are your prescriptions for such a person, my friend? (It's good to see you again.)

what is philosopher.life

It is a name conditionally leased through ICANN and a number of other authorities that links to a site hosted on github. Most people who reach my ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî± do so through that [[link]].
I cannot sum up easily what it is for you. It is a very large piece of work, at least 70 100k-word novels worth of words in length.
I do my best to explain what it is in the [[Readme]]: https://philosopher.life/#Readme
I speak with all kinds, [[nomad]]. It's an honor to meet you. My name is [[h0p3]].
I'm a very consistent interlocutor, and I do my best to be useful to people, [[WINTCIS]].
I'm reading through your accounts. Huge fan of rejecting nihilism. I take Saint Jesus' words extremely seriously as well. I'm an interlocutor who speaks with people at great lengths (and the proof is there for ya, [[Find The Others]]).
Stirner is not a place we should go, unless you really want to [[wrestle]].
Some people find it is best to speak carefully with me. It smooths the way for our long-term relationships. I take our words together quite seriously.
Huge fan of this "Surrealist Companionship of All"

ahh, that's cool
so it's like a mix of a novel and a blog
the house of leaves of blog

Definitely in the ergodic hypertext literature category, aye. =)

yoo, that's cool, that's cool
