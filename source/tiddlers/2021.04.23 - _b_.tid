If my body is not donated to science or necrophiliacs (y not both), and if my body is not taxidermied into a standing "soap dispenser" for the bathroom (I'm really going to miss my party-potty [Bostonian-only plz]), then I ask for a BBQ for those who swear they really love me to eat my cooked flesh, and then I want it burned down into ashes and poured into an hourglass. You may use "me" for either games or timing lectures or speaking events (you may speak over my dead body, okay?).

If you think it's a tall task to cross the bridge to me, please consider how tall of a task it was for me to build it to you. Reading, by far, is the easier and least committal part.

It's fair to say I'm looking for change and agreement, not simply tolerance or acceptance. Changing from intolerance to tolerance (or vv) can be the limits of progress in some scopes of time (to be lauded in many cases). Merely maintaining hollow tolerance without working to resolve disagreement is suspect.

What foreigner does not lie about their religion and relations while abroad? Who wouldn't?

I say this as someone with the privilege of 64GB of RAM and an idiotically unoptimized pile of text online. You should care about container sizes because the future of [[computing]] progress is bottlenecked into multi-threading, you need to work on unikernels and continue virtualization orchestration, it offers improved carbon-efficient scaling, poor people deserve high-quality access to [[The Great Human Conversation]], we should be able to understand and work on our own machines if we are to own the means of production, and performant P2P computing requires it in many cases. It's okay to fail some here (I do!), but to act like it's irrelevant borders on malicious.
