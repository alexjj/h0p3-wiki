*** Looks like offline installations will be prevented.

*** Ugh. Capitalists, not users, will probably benefit from this. Unless the user has a simple way to verify the entire boot process (and I'm certaintly not able to invest my time into doing anything of the sort), I don't see this being valuable to us. I also think there are ways to abuse this to proprietary advantage. At the extreme end: even a type of DRM, surveillance, or governance that would make other systems effectively illegal or infeasible to use (at least if you wish to engage capitalist production modes, and we must to survive). Feels like yet another root.
