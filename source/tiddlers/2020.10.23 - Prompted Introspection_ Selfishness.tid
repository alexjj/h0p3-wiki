title: 2020.10.23 - Prompted Introspection: Selfishness

!! In what way are you selfish?

Many ways in many contexts, including connotations of the word that are strictly negative or unjustified. I think there's significant selfishness in how I construct my wiki, for example. Even just the amount of work and {[[Focus]]} that has gone into this wiki that models me so absurdly must surely be called selfish (and not just in the original sense of "autistic"). It's so wrongheaded in the eyes of most who would glance at it; labeling it at least "idiotic selfish noise" is probably the standard kneejerk judgment to make, and I appreciate that (even though I dispute it to some [[dok]]). 

I'm not claiming that just any expenditure of this magnitude of effort on one's writing about oneself can be justified, [[WINTCIS]]. I think it's fair to say my wiki doesn't just serve me though. I've been lucky enough to encounter some people who have found it a valuable model in reasoning about their own lives too (surely of what not to do). The amount of time I can devote to such a task has had to vary. I've had to balance it. It's not just the time investment directly into the wiki either, as even the manner in which the various processes in my life spiral around it and become modified in virtue of feedback-loop mapping onto it count toward selfishness. Surely, the [[Wiki Litmus Test]] looks insane to at least newcomers. There is a skin in the game problem I continue to run into though.<<ref "h">> Even [[T42T]] requires some order of selfishness.<<ref "s">> I have an [[arrogant]] hack'n'slash way about my wiki, and whether or not I'm delusional about its instrumentality and telos is something that must be [[questioned]] again and again.
