title: 2022.03.14 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Ruminatory

<<<
[[TTTOTW]]. I believe my sympaticon was having another nightmare. I'm glad she is not bothered when I wake her. [[TTTOTW]]. It's cold down here. Foot and hand warmers.

...

[[Family Time]] @ 3. Pickles, water, vapelyfe. Lots of thinking about [[Variety Creepy]].

//Pulp Fiction//. A first for my offspring, which is rare. I consider the rape scene pretty difficult though, so I have waited for this one. Plenty to think about. My daughter is plenty hung up on what makes it pulp fiction.

Put my sympaticon to couch. I tried to sleep.
<<<

Couldn't sleep. Tried. Rumination. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Bits with [[Variety Creepy]]. Tuna + toast + water. //PBS Frontline: To Catch A Trader//. //Videodrome//.

Woke at 11? Garbage sleep. Rumination. I'm off.

Tag with [[esinpe]] ([[Variety Creepy]]). Massage for my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]]. Tea.

Rumination & Dadnap.

[[JRE]] called. He's doing the paperwork to take time off for us coming down. Also, he may get a full 9 weeks off paid for paternity leave if the adoption goes through (far, far away) on [[Q]]. I didn't get any (well, I had to save all vacation and sick leave for years). I'm glad to hear it's different from him. [[Bn]] rests his penis on the edge of the toilet, but they are lucky to have slow closing lids (for sleep and this exact problem). The boy just stayed there as the lid closed and moaned though, so I know what fetish he's got, `/thumbs-up`.<<ref "k">> Bro is trying to push for some strategic collective bargaining, as nothing was addressed. Contract lasts for 4 years. [[Q]] met his donor for the last time, we believe. Perfectly awkward.

[[TTTOTW]].

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. //Inform the Men!// Shower of the gods!

[[TTTOTW]].

//The Toilet Date//. Not mine to choose here, and I'm glad we were able to go. Much cheaper at Home Depot than the online options. Found a one piece<<ref "q">> two flusher for one fitty that seems like it will work. We'll see. 

[[Family Gathering]] was pleasant. Dev came over, [[5c0ut]] made Indian curries, a veggie dish, his pickles, and basmati. Water too. Talked for a while before we jumped into the VR episode of //House//.

[[TTTOTW]].

Put mi amor to bed. Yet again, seeing my offspring lack the grindset. They've voiced interest in [[D2]] again. I never really did get a serious playthrough with them, and that is an excellent game in which to come to appreciate how to abuse the skinnerbox mentality and appreciate what it means to optimize (though, it's hard to know without having mistakes in the first place). Hrm. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Massage. [[TTTOTW]].
