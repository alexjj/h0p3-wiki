title: Poem: The RRole of Love

//"have a sonnet"//

<<<
"""
No stranger art thou to the rules of Love,
Nor I, yet no man else could swear to this; 
To thee, a full devotion I dream of;
A Fool's commitment in a fulsome kiss.

Know that to forfeit, fail thee, or to flee,
I would abhor; and shouldst thou shed a tear,
Then tears we'll share, for I shall ne'er leave thee,
Nor tell the falsehood, cause thee harm or fear.

Long have we known and lov'd each other's minds;
Thine heart doth ache, but caution stops thy tongue.
Ask not mine heart; swear not thine eyes are blind;
Inside, thou know'st, this game we've play'd too long.

Ne'er would I give thee up, nor let thee down.
Ne'er would I thee desert, nor see thee frown.
