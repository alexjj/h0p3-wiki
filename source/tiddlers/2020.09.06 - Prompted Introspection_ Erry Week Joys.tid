title: 2020.09.06 - Prompted Introspection: Erry Week Joys

!! What do you look forward to every week?

[[weekly.tmpl]] is too barren, sadly. I look forward to the possibility of my offspring's effort in [[Homeschooling.tmpl]], rabbitholing with my offspring, some Read+Write, [[Fireman Time]]!, good sleep, skinhunger satiation, The Walk with my wife, [[Family Gathering]]s and [[Family Time]] especially, [[FTO]] with a wide variety of people, vapeylife, and eating delicious food. I feel simple and privileged here.
