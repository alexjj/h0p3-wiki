Just fix your personality, bruh. You'd be more liked if people found you more likeable, and what they like is exactly what is worth liking, of course. It's all unique style, original desire, and mere mimesis.

I wonder if some Bayesians (in their acceptance of some unexplained phenomenon of nested functional bottom-up and top-down convergence) might accept that the both contents and components of consciousness are conscious. That'd be a surprising Hegelian twist. Hard problem.

I believe in Y, so I don't need X. Admittedly, there are sound examples of that form.

Gaslighting projections may be the leaking internal self-validation rhetoric of the narcissist. It is but one face of the dark-triad factor, and their identical core: denying The Golden Rule, making an exception of oneself through whatever rationalization is necessary to protect that ego, using others as mere means in any [[dok]] (even through indifference, apathy, and self-imposed ignorance). One subset is a group of people who dislike themselves consistently enough (a lack of fitting empathy in one's self-objectification will give rise to psychopathy) that they end up studying others for the wrong reasons: looking for merely deconstructive bullying opportunities (perhaps to feel superior until the hit inevitably wears off and they circle in for more). Being open to criticism will get abused, especially in a world filled with vampires. It's still necessary for a fit moral compass, both in theory and practice. It's easy to dislike that subset (though we can be fallible in picking them out). We give a [[bias]]ed break, however, to those who are nice (seems like cooperation, right?). Unfortunately, the cost of uncovering a covert-narcissist demonstrates a mental state as sinister as naked aggression. [[FTSO]] [[W5H]] do we spend our compute time?

Being lovebombed with mirrors gives one a chance to test for moral compasses, and [[I programmed you to believe that!|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngCg_ES4ApY]]
