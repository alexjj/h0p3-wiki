title: 2020.11.20 - Prompted Introspection: Galt House Hotel

!! Write about a memorable experience you have had staying at a hotel.

[[2017.11.29 - Prompted Introspection Log: Worst Vacation]] is one such experience. 

IIRC, one of the last times I got to spend time with Jeff (from [[2018.05.01 - Prompted Introspection Log: Old Friend]]) was at Annual Conference for the UMC in Louisville, KY ('97?). I don't know why he was there. We stayed at one of the fanciest fucking hotels I've ever been in, The Galt House Hotel (no idea who paid for this shit). We played a lot of blackjack, and I memorized the deck as we played. It was like a magic trick for him; he liked his retard buddy for that sort of thing and didn't mind losing (which was otherwise quite unlike him). We got to hit the food court downtown and walk around the city like big kids (we were so gangster, you have no idea). I had lived in Louisville before, but this was the first time I was ever let loose in it. I think I had a youth group trip there a couple years later, and I remember visiting the art museum + theater for something else (it's fuzzy, =/). I remember it was a lot to take in. Little did I know I'd be walking the same spot for my job at Humana about a decade later. 

I still dream of this place.
