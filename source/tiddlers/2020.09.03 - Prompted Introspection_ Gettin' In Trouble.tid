title: 2020.09.03 - Prompted Introspection: Gettin' In Trouble

!! What did you get into trouble for the most when you were a kid?

Annoying my male donor: the punishments ranged wildly. I realize, I am annoying: no doubt, straight-up. I ended up being on the receiving end of "getting in trouble" far more than my younger brothers. I accept that a portion of his violence was justified. Too often, he didn't take the time to try to explain himself well enough. I was regularly praised for my behavior outside of my home until I was 12 (and, at their church, I still maintained what was necessary for their appearances), despite the fact that I was a weirdo.

The past is often a reminder that I wish I had never been born. Though it wanes, there is still [[hope]] in the present and the future to some [[dok]].
