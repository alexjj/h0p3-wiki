title: 2021.06.28 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: If I'm allowed to lick your butthole, then I'm allowed to lick your toothbrush.

<<<
[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]+LolVod. I've made significant progress in clearing out tabs. Cleaned [[the den]] well. Sleep by 9? Woke at 3. Fireman Time! 

[[Family Time]] sans [[5c0ut]] (sleeping or away with Miryam). [[TTP]]s. 

She laid there on my bed and read. Thicc. Phat. Hawt. I've put a timer on myself to not bother her. Leave my angel in her world. Thinking about a custom and very cheap desk approach for her. Shawty needs it short.<<ref "i">> 

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

[[TTTOTW]]. Ranga came down to pets and kitty krack. Sleep by 1! Just hit me. Woke at unknown time. That's privilege right there. Long Meditation. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. [[Morning Routine]]. Laundry.

//The Walk// with my offspring. Heatwave has hit us, and lawd, it's like I'm back in TN or NO. As predicted, they did a terrible job, though my daughter clearly read. Get dad off on an tangent (they've learned how to control their teacher ;P), and you're golden. Thinkin' about her [[art]].<<ref "s">> We continue to think about the structures of power and wealth in society. They've forgotten 95% of what we've talked about, but each time we talk about it, they pick it up faster and go deeper. I can see the wheels turning in my son. That boy picks up some difficult things quick as a whip. They asked for an explanation of Gamestonk, and it fit where we were anyway. We keep making strides toward the problem of passive investment dominance (which, I have tried to explain is a fringe conspiracy theory that holds more water than most want to admit). We have agreed I am a backseat armchair dismal humanitittiest, and I'm glad they know I'm absolutely retarded. Wish the walk was twice as long. We needed more time. It was really fucking hot though.

We cooled down in my room. Shot some shit, my daughter on her machine. [[The Den]] is dope in dire times. Laundry.

I'm trouble with my wife (okay, I agree, that isn't rational, and you are starting your period): my daughter has a minor sunburn. I've been banned from walking with them (I used to let these kids play out in weather just as hot as this in KY, TN, LA, Thailand, and they were young'ns too...this girl-woman is almost as tall as I am, and she beats me up - she can take care of herself, bring water, she knows where the sunscreen is, has her own fancy umbreller and watnot, etc.)

Prepared dinner with my offspring; my boy is not trying to concentrate today, and I'm taking him to task for it.

Talked with [[5c0ut]] for a while. His belly hasn't been feeling great. Vaping works, but food is no go. He's shooting for steadying his schedule. Tried talking about [[2021.06.21 - benhylau: A Quiet Response]]. Lawyer called, doesn't want the case, suggested Department of Labor; though, continued phone calls (and bringing his own documentation) has continued the process (he's still getting jerked around). He's eased up talkin about the issue with Miryam since it needlessly adds stress to her life he feels. 

A nap. Sweet, baby jesus.

[[TTTOTW]]. My wife came down for //Skintime// + //The Office//. Tomorrow. Cool. Her workday was good! Holy shit, dude. Most of the time, when she's not there, the whole fucking place falls apart. Not this time. People pulled their weight, and it was just a bunch of e-mails, then bidness as usual. She's still getting comments and requests for help after her presentation, so that's not too bad atttttall. She's surrounded by competence: it's dope.

[[Family Gathering]] with everyone in [[The Den]] (so hot upstairs).<<ref "w">> We watched //Arrested Development//, two episodes. Been begging my daughter to try it; no person who loves stories and memes like she does should go without watching this one. It's genius, at least to my retarded eyes. It is quite obvious that my offspring are significantly more knowledgeable and capable of understanding the show than I was when it came out. All the adults have watched it multiple times, and it's fun watching them interpret and make predictions (and, given that they've enough maymays in their diet, they've got some footholds). I feel good that they are much further along than I was (and eventually 'am', I assume). We had ribs, wedges (I'm cuttin em thicc again!), zucchini and squash, watermelon, and water. I eventually laid down, and my wife joined me. :P.

[[TTTOTW]]. She finished her chapter downstairs with me while I fiddled with her. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! Honey Whiskey + [[TTTOTW]]. Laundry.

<<footnotes "s" "She asked if she finally decided to connect with [[DeathOfRobinhood]], would she not have to speak with me?...lmao. Yeah, right.">>

<<footnotes "w" "With the new protest of 'Why can't I just have dinner in my room without you all?' -- because we love you, loser. This shit counts, and you know it. You already knew everything I was going to say before you asked the question (and you knew I knew that too, and we all knew I was going to respond :P). Do you want to walk through it? No? Okay. I love you.">>
