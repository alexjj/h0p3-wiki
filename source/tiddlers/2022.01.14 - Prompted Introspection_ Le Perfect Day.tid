I have no idea how to answer this question well enough. Part of the perfection of a day is that it varies from other days, to some extent. Peaks on the hedonic treadmill require we experience suffering too, and the reason for that day's perfection will be in virtue of other days too. Perfect [[gfwiwcgws]], [[FTSO]][[W5H]]? My days serve other days toward other ends. Into isolation, the perfect moment doesn't appear sufficient, nor the perfect day. I can appreciate trying to draw lines in a thought experiment, such as groundhog day eternal recurrence, this is the last day before the asteroid strikes, desert island vacuum chambers, etc. That's not the life before me (to my knowledge).
