Hey DeathOfRobinhood,

It's going alright here. I have been working to dance and sing during my [[pause]], [[Root User]].<<ref "w">> I needed to do that. Thank you.

I'm doing my best to be emotionally stable (except when I'm dancing, of course :P). I cried with you when we last spoke, and then I cried again that night with [[Sphygmus]]. I'm trying to understand my changing place in her life. I have [[paused]] the wiki to continue a crucial conversation with at least her. Everyone seems to be thinking and feeling a lot right now. I've got enough space to pull back in some places and take a plunge in others (as well as some time to think more quietly than usual). Life has not slowed down in all senses; I'm still working hard. But, I've been spending more time than usual on the bed ruminating and observing, but I'm still functioning and our home makes progress. I'm going to try to make the world stop spinning for a second so I can focus on my heart beat and then continue the hunt.

Since I began, I've never actually paused from writing in my wiki fully. I lasted a week not writing in it (albeit, with a couple text files, though I did not complete [[CDR]]s and did my best to minimize my habit, and I still had to read it). I started writing in my wiki again, though it's quiet and I'm still feeling it out (I'm trying to be ruthless in reforming the habit). I'm in Gribble Schizoid Stealth Mode for the moment, lol (I'm pretty sure I look like the naked man in camo paint frozen on the front lawn [I'm only invisible when people or cameras aren't looking at me, :P]). Only someone examining the diffs of the snapshots will likely see it all.

How's your week going?

I know I'm on the hunt. I'm looking for direction. Part of me feels like the time is right for whatever needs to happen with me, but I don't know what that is yet. I've been thinking about it, and [[k0sh3k]] agrees I should wait before diving in. I have a lot on my plate (I know it doesn't look like it). There's a non-trivial possibility these people deserve 100% from me, and I don't have 100% to give yet. Here's some draft thoughts I wrote down before recognizing I may not be in a fitting position (perhaps the time is not right [which sucks because I do want to know these people really well]):

Nomads, indeed. Yeah, I've seen them before! They are legends, no doubt. I am only partially familiar with some of their work.<<ref "m">> They are very talented from what I've seen and understood, their work is gorgeous, and I admire the reasoning they've provided on the few topics I do understand. I know just enough to be have earned the right to be impressed. Anyone actually using Plan 9 as a daily driver is leet AF (one day, we'll build the whole world from scratch in [[Forth|2020.06.10 - Prompted Introspection: Forth]]). I almost reached out to them on [[2019.06.11 - Link Log: Wipe]] (I doubt they are going to find me worth their time). They seem to live novel lives too. Their lifestyle appears to require pathological creativity and hacker efficiency; it looks like an experimental pre-apocalyptic survivalist thinktank-shop-incubator (way more stylish than my hiki basement dwelling, lol). I think we both adore tools, and I would be curious to learn what they believe tools are really for.<<ref "p">>

I see tons of overlap in our projects. Mine is extremely skiddie, glacial, ugly, bloated, incoherent, and lacking adaptivity in comparison, lol. I also do not predict my success (and, I think it's fair to say most people wouldn't and shouldn't), and that may be problematic for them. In my experience, I function most usefully to what matters most when I'm a sounding board for the developers and philosophers I've met. I'm open to talking about whatever (doesn't have to be anything serious). But, let us say we did have a project together, I would want to learn from these nomads how to help the world skid off the grid on the low-hanging fruit devices available to us. I'm interested in what an individual should tend to choose and what a nation-state-level actor should choose here for the people of the world.

That impoverished kid in India: may they be the leetest among us, may their voice be heard above ours (both in automation and what remains of the by-hand digital commons), may they tell us the stories of who they are from their own data and devices. I fear I will inevitably fail to empathize with a world who has not told uswho they are with fitting autonomy. Digital identities require many kinds of protection, one of which is a radically decentralized infrastructure over which we virtualize how we touch a world. The workers must own the means of production, and I admire how they aim to own their machines. I have failed here again and again and again (almost entirely due to my own stupidity). Some say it is impossible.

Anyway, that's one idea. Happy to build a relationship even without any ideas too (though I think we'd enjoy talking about a lot).

No chaperoning is necessary, but also, the more the merrier.

```
Mumble:                        ...
Tox:                           ...
Or whatever tool fits best:    ...
```
<<<

Perhaps I should say "hello" anyway. Relationships take time to build. I'm still at the crossroads in a lot of places (including the direction I should take [[FTO]]). At the moment, I'm feeling like 2021 needs to be a slower year for me (I [[hope]] I'm wrong, of course).

Love,
