If you want a replacement to FB, this is a reasonable method. The users own the means of production, and you can host it on any number of networks. I'm happy to seed your hypercore on [[Beaker Browser|https://beakerbrowser.com/]] too.

[[qTox|https://qtox.github.io/]] will give you real-time access to me. Protonmail works cleanly as well. Ultimately, I [[hope]] to read your stories from your own site too! I use [[Tiddlywiki|https://tiddlywiki.com]] for mine (I'm down to help you set a site up too), but there's tons of good options (I'm happy to even read plaintext files, bro). My responses outside of IMing will be from my ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 (a bookmark goes a long way).
