title: 2022.11.07 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Practice

<<<
Snacks + //Skintime// + LoL Worlds with my sympaticon. Chat with [[Variety Creepy]]. Back to Worlds. Probably the best finals I've ever seen. It was full anime. My daughter was up late, I believe. Neosporin for whatever she did to her heel.

Sleep by 5?

Woke at noon. Gumpination. Hugs'n'bugs. [[TTTOTW]]. Caffeine. Son's phone wasn't working right. Swapped SIMs, seemed like it was the SIM card, but after putting it back in, it worked. Makes no sense. But, alright.

We gathered for [[The Salient Cube]]. I refined my primary deck several times. Gave my opinions on theory and the pools each person had. I think the descriptor, [[Salient]], is becoming more obvious upon our initial filtering and construction.  bNarrowing down is hard, and I know my daughter is feeling overwhelmed by how many choices there are to make. Thinking about how perhaps she should consider technical writing. Unfortunately, there was little left for me to do until after trades. 

//The Walk// with mi amor. She tired. Very. Full route though. Quiet and small offshoots of thought.

Continued [[The Salient Cube]] initial construction phase. My son had a deck most of the way together, and he was ready to trade. I had already picked out the cards I was interested in, and he picked out cards and set out trades for each. Negotiation. I was willing to spend more cards and power, asymmetrically, because I really only needed a particular few cards to round out what I had. Couldn't give up Humility just because I consider too damaging to my deck (even though I have an answer). People were magic'd out. Lots of thinking. Continue practicing with my deck to get a feel; it's feelin' alright. Fundamental turn might even be t4-5ish average.

Hugs with [[5c0ut]]. The man survives. I think our hugs are cute.

Cooking with my sympaticon. [[Family Time]]. Grilled cheese BLT with mayo. Yes, it works. How could it not? Watched prequel alt-episode thing of //The Sandman//. [[TTTOTW]]. 

//The Walk// with my sympaticon. Nearly full route. 

Laundry. [[TTTOTW]]. Cubing with my sympaticon. Put mi amor to bed. Assignments. [[TTTOTW]]. Waitlisted (hate this bullshit) for Arc Browser. Curious, ofc. Thinking about my sympaticon's deck. She's a good eye.

[[TTTOTW]]. Noodles. Smashing tabs all over the place.

```bash
yay -S shellcheck-bin --noconfirm #pretty dope
```

I did it: I completed all of surf tabs! What what! (I mean, I still have that 3kish list sitting a txt file, but I'm back in black, yo).

Saw mi amor off. She slept! Bread with her. Institute connected to my PhD program just flew in a speaker to deliver a dope paper on gender identity eliminativism, and my brother [[JRE]] and my daughter have been on my mind with it. Common topic for us. [[TTTOTW]]. Not only did I clear out my surf tabs, I dropped another thousand from the old list sitting in buffer (the easiest 1k, ofc, mostly dupes and nothings). 

Noticed our hopefully new ISP closed our support ticket, no explanations, no fix (which I verified). Wrote them a letter. [[TTTOTW]]. Sleep by 7:30?

Woke at 2. Hugs'n'bugs. Offspring came down to grind. [[TTTOTW]]. I got a call from the ISP, but no voice. Called back, found a more helpful operator than last time. They asked for traceroutes. Gave lots of examples. We'll see. I'm not holding my breath. Wrote it up, sent it off. 

[[The Salient Cube]] "practice" games to hone our decks. These are //not// official tournament games. We were itchin' to play, and we wanted to get a feel for them. Played one with [[1uxb0x]] and three with [[j3d1h]]. Many unique game situations. They made decisions together against me. `/nod`. My deck is a beast, but I think they will learn how to target it (`/fingers-crossed`). 

Mi amor called. Lots of phone disconnect troubles for me too. Hrm. Mi amor is workin' on her paper. I'm glad to see her using the library as a student; it's hard to beat having that experience (again and again) to give her perspective as a librarian (not that she necessarily learns much, but it may increase confidence intervals or highlight what is salient). Mi amor made me think we should consider changing not just our wired ISP, but maybe our wireless too.

//Skintime// + //Red Rising// @3:02:42:42 with my sympaticon.

[[Family Gathering]] was delicious. [[1uxb0x]] made pulled pork (I liked his seasoning choices), wedges (he cooked them at a higher temp and for longer, tons of salt, I had a ton :P), salad, and I had a coffee beer (I was surprised that my sympaticon strongly disliked it) for a treat. //Mr. Robot//. Unfortunately, that beer demolished me. Feel asleep near the end of the show. Maybe it was 7?
