title: 2021.02.22 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Und Für Sie

//To my brothers! Kings! I dance for you.//

Lots of thinking and feeling. Bursting. The timing is impeccable, synchronistic even: I just pseudo-cussed-out a ~79yo woman whom I find quite attractive. You know exactly why I aim to be cognitive here: I'm emotionally retarded and underdeveloped. When are you going to believe me when I tell you I'm stupid? When are you going to relieve me by telling me I'm your retard? I fucking hate my weaknesses. Seriously. ugh. I'm trying to let go of my analysis mode and just feel it with you. I'm sorry if I fail.

[[AIR]] paid me an exceptional compliment, among the highest I've ever received in my life. He said I'm a supporting pillar of our family and that [[Family Time]] is an amazing practice that he wishes we had growing up; I sit in stark contrast to what we had.

Shit sleep. Headache. Δ⁸ is probably the problem. Fuck. Fireman Time! is dope.

Hugged'n'bugged everyone. 16 years today. Jesus. =). 

Wife acquired a monitor, and I don't understand how G can be considered qualified if he doesn't know this information. It's 101 shit.

Called [[JRE]]. Heard he was having a rough day, and he didn't want to wake me (should have). The anxiety of a hyperaware father. He's going to be so much better than I am. Everyone is doing alright. MS is making verbal progress, inferences of "me" and "dad," accurate call and responses, verbalizing on cue. He almost has the pieces to connect with his dad deeply, to see a world few ever will. Also, things might be changing with the piece of paper. Thinking about [[Justice]] together. Addy dropoff in effect, ugh. Asked him to consider writing with me. He's qualified, can wrestle hard AF, already knows lots of the foundation, is familiar with the canned perspectives, and he knows just how crazy unlikely it is. I'm hoping it will be a [[Lifetime Project]] together.

Had lunch with my son, MUC vs Affinity +1, 0, stomps, nothing he could do in the first, and failure to Wish->Hurkyl's (the only possible out). He lost hardware, and he has to buy it now. Room is closer. I saw a wiki open, and I heard a "yes." I dare not look, but I [[hope]].

Scrubbed the bathroom and applied caulking. I suppose the floor will have to just be redone some day. It works though. Not sure if this is going to fix our problem yet, but it's a good start. Hopefully, the leaks will be fixed now. `/fingers-crossed`. Walking my offspring through actually cleaning a floor for the umpteenth, KMN.

More bugging my offspring.

[[Family Gathering]], ratatouille, perfectly thin garlic bread, and the fried chicken was crazy. Wildly better than anything the rest of us could make. My brother has to make a cookbook before the end of his life. We sat at the table long after we stopped eating to talk. My son had his back turned to everyone at the beginning, but he warmed up to us. Noice. I like that I don't have to carry any conversation and everything I say is simply dirty. My daughter keeps punching me in the liver, a lot.

We did the kitchen together today. I liked it. We've tried it many times, and it may just work now. Sweet. 

Skin. Sex. Shower. Slave to that booty. Yanno, it was a good day, [[ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱]].

"Satan" is always the hawtest of all the gods (that show gets it right, and so did those sculpting brothers). Morning Star, Shining One, Lightbringer. Oh, yes.

[[TTTOTW]] + Dancing in my seat. 

[[AIR]] and [[j3d1h]] spent hours baking cookies and sweet things ([[AA]] would have been proud of the pumpkin batch). A tasty baking bootcamp bonding session. With all her giggles, daughter brought me a caramel she sculpted into a pile of dogshit (such an artist). Talking with her tonight about having a class next semester in cooking. Wouldn't take long for her to have a lot of the basics down, and ... of course I could talk for hours. You know what I think. I keep repeating myself year and after year. It's my job.

Hung out with my bro while I cleaned my cube, soap and water, the last of my speed lubricant. It's quiet and turns perfectly again. Stickers are gone. Just for the stim. Also, woke my wife while upstairs with my cicada worry beads: I got the muhfuckin look from the nicest [[k0shiqua]] I've ever met.

MJArsenal Titan and SaiDrag2 before the ban.
