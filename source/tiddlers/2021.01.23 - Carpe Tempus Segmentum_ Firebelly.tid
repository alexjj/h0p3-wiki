title: 2021.01.23 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Firebelly

* [[T-Money]] had some heavy things to talk about. Much of his life is flashing before him.
* Writing until 7am.
** My eyes hurt. My penis needs something wet and soft to fuck. My belly has been on fire for days. It's not going away.
** The letter is finished. \o/. Usually, it takes me forever to write one to her. That was one easy. 
** Owe [[DeathOfRobinhood]] and perhaps [[PH]] a thorough response, more than what I have so far.
* Chilled with honeybuns for a bit.
* Finally slept, no idea what time.
* Woke at 3
** Feel good.
* Wife was sleeping, so I wandered.
* Reminded my offspring of their duties
* Inform the Men!
** Something we almost never do: we fucked to music. Some space ambient. It was magical. Smooth, warm, tight, smothered. She hates my bed, but it's simply the best for sex and for my sleep. 
** Kinda dangerous to fuck in my room; anyone could walk downstairs (though everyone knows not to).
*** Surprisingly hard to get off to this music. I fuck hard for the last 10 minutes (she's never had scarring, but this year, she might...I give everything I have these days).
** I think her holding me is the most important part of my day so far. Even more important than walking! She is like a crutch for me. I am dependent. 
* Meditation
* Shower of the gods!
** My wife is growing a bit more comfortable with me holding her while she pees. She doesn't understand, in a sense, but I'm glad I'm not tossed out for it.
* Offspring have failed again. It is not my problem now. 
* Son's room continues to smell awful. We continue to try to solve it with him.
* ⁸Δ⁸
* Dinner Date
** Chinese food in the car, hehe. It was on the fly. I realized we should right when we got there.
** A worker at the front memed hard with me. :P
** It was quiet, very cold, had my music on as background, just chilled. I'm looking forward to doing this with her again and again and again.
** My wife is unhappy that food isn't spicy enough up here. That makes sense. 
* Shopping @ Aldi
** Very simple shopping, still expensive because we bought a lot of ginger beer. I'm trying to keep her extremely well-stocked. It seems to work on her tummy somewhat.
* Skintime!
** She was sleepy too. She got a lot of rest today. I'm glad. She needed it.
* Slept until 11:30
* Meditation & Rumination
* Wife promised she'd go to sleep (she got up to watch her garbage :P). 
* Try To Take Over The World
