title: 2021.09.01 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Lots of Sleep

Footbath + [[TTTOTW]]. Laying off, as requested. `/sniff`. Bit of prep for dinner. No idea what time I fell asleep. It hit me hard though.

Woke up at 10:30 drained. Nightmares of people surrounding and entering my house to commit violence, with no recourse. Ugh. Meditation. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Dadnap. [[TTTOTW]].

//The Walk// with my offspring did not start out well. She didn't do her work, and I don't want her to deceive either of us. Appreciating the boundaries of our rights to express our feelings. With zero resistance, she must admit the implications of her autonomy. We got through it, and it smoothed out. My son did his work, and it kept us busy. Tons of argumentation about permaculture (and he was thinking about Liet Kynes here too). Thought about eco-stereotypes as well.

She's at the table studying. Apparently, it's going to be a minimum of 10 hours a week outside of class. That is a chunk of change. I like that she's learning classical instead of just what's in the NT. 8 people in the class; that's sizable enough (one of her students is her peer in this course...a dynamic I hope she experiences many times over, :P). One student in there is on her 8th language. 

Prep for dinner. Son's knifework is improving.

We spent some time downstairs working on our projects. My son is going much slower than he should be. No fun giving me excuses that I know aren't true. I hope he does the right thing.  

[[TTTOTW]]. Canvassing. Ranga has been coming to me for pets quite a bit.

//Raw Skintime//. Many transitions in the next couple weeks. Yaleys are lucky enough to taste-test and shop for their classes (technically something we see elsewhere, but it's encouraged/accepted in a different way here), but that puts extra pressures on her scheduling. Oh, not great news, but her prediction is that A will replace C with the previous holder, M, who has an unhealthy set of dynamics with J as it is. That is surprising to me in some sense, but maybe it shouldn't be. 

[[Family Gathering]] was short but good. //House//. We had brats with rye, kraut, onions, a hash, and watermelon (dark chocolate too). I've been asking if there's unanimous desire to watch a second, but my daughter has easily had enough of us by the end. I hear that. Go get your stuff done and be with your friends, girl.

Sent her some spaced repetition resources for her book. [[TTTOTW]]. Nudging folks to bed. Phone alerts for all the weather awesomeness tonight. Lub me dat thunderclap straight from the lightning. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Leftovers + dark chocolate. Oh, UPS went off and there's a leak from the ghetto window (where whoever lived here before punched a hole for the dryer exhaust but I guess didn't seal it well enough). A very small flood in the basement. My poor particle board, lol. I'm //so// proud of myself for reserving a basket of dirty laundry (beyond my "not dirty enough" cubelet next to my desk), as it was easy to pile it on, stomp it, sop it up, call it solved for the night (I hope...the flash flood warnings are being extended into the morning).
