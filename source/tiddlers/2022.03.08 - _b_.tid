Including oneselves, [[aim]] to guide the lost seeking to be blamelessly innocent and unblemished.

Like a lantern, it can be educational watching people interpret how I deal with covert narcs in front of them.

Even if only in terms of probabilities, the questions you refuse to answer often tell me quite a bit about you.

It saddens me to see people choose to live the lie and roleplay in what is largely a fiction of their own construction. To some [[dok]], we cannot escape this problem, but we can make progress by honestly pursuing what is outside ourselves when it is not merely [[FTSO]] of ourselves.

Perhaps: Most of the time, I'm watching wanton NPCs, in the Frankfurtian sense, who don't even care how they choose which [[FO]] desire to act upon in the construction of their epistemology. They do so without integrity, justification, or even shred of apology for their narcissistic solipsism.
