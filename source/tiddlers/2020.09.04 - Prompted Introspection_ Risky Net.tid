title: 2020.09.04 - Prompted Introspection: Risky Net

!! Do you prefer taking risks or having a safety net?

Those aren't mutually exclusive universally, but at some level we have to choose which risks are worth answering or taking. There's no way to not have risk in life. For example, we all face philosophical existential risk at all times. We can't even eliminate survival risks. Just getting out of bed is a risk (and so is not). We can minimize some risks though, and I prefer minimizing Bayesian regret (while maintaining a radical idealism). The construction of safety has its own risks too. Risk of what? Risk for whom, [[gfwiwcgws]]? Of course, I need more context. I think I have serious variance in me here, and I think it's not easy to interpret what consists in risk-taking.

Do I dive head-first into places that are normally considered foolhardy? Sometimes, yes. I'm willing to go all-in far more often than most. I also have significant disagreements over predictions of the world (including [[SO]] effects, probabilistic implications, etc.) with almost everyone. There is an objective answer here, but I'm only able to guess with bias. I can't give a short answer to this question that's coherent enough.

Consider, for example, that I think retirement is simply out of reach for almost everyone in my cohort (even those who would be happy to subsist on very little). The risk of failure for even attempting it is simply too high for me. It's not like I'm not going to pick low-hanging fruit for my wife's retirement, but I'm not planning for mine and I don't think she will be able to retire either.<<ref "r">> While I'll agree I could make enough money as a capitalist to retire, I don't think I could make enough to retire given moral means, especially not given what I think is required of someone in my shoes. Trying to build a safety-net in this sense is too risky. 

I think it's fair to say I'm a hedger of some kind.
