title: 2021.12.24 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: More Chill

Arrived home from //The Walk// with [[ASK]]. Didn't go the second route because the streets are not safe with the snowplows. 

Hotdogs with pickles, mustard, and onion on rye. [[TTTOTW]]. I've brought [[m16]] to its knees, `/bow`. Comfortable yet shitty sleep, 3 beds, by 4?

Woke at 2? It was enough, though felt half-brained with nightmares woven. Meditation. Fireman Time! Hugs'n'bugs with erryone.

Offspring and I worked on [[The Cube]]. 

Directories with 10 million files each (bars and names in reverse order, IIRC):

"""
â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ Would
â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–’ you
â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–’â–’ be
â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–’â–’â–’ interested
â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–’â–’â–’â–’ in
â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–’â–’â–’â–’â–’ sucking
â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–’â–’â–’â–’â–’â–’ my
â–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–’â–’â–’â–’â–’â–’â–’ microscopic
â–ˆâ–ˆâ–’â–’â–’â–’â–’â–’â–’â–’ e-penis
â–ˆâ–’â–’â–’â–’â–’â–’â–’â–’â–’ ?
"""

Not even the tools which don't hash files could handle it. `/nod`. 

```bash
rm -r ð“‚º
```

Sous chef to [[ASK]] for the kielbasa bake. 

[[TTTOTW]].

//Equilibrium//: not taking any pill at all is its own pill. I think it is like a play. He is maintaining equilibrium for the equilibrium society in creating the enemies necessary for his own role to continue to exist in society, and that is the response to his quasi-empath partner. Obviously, there is no cognition as we would know it without S1.

[[TTTOTW]] and bugging my peeps.
