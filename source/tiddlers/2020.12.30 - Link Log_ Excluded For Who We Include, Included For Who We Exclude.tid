* Stunning!

*** I know how crazy this person looks (I read about them a long time ago), but it's my job to pick 'em. Crackpot or not, this feller is brilliant.
**** We have some serious disagreements, even in practical matters (and especially political).
*** Despite avoiding talking about it, it is a version of Hegel reiterated. I appreciate how telic it is. Teleology is, apparently, a spook. Glad to see True Believers^^tm^^ taking it up. Idealism is expensive to think about. 

* Confirm My Bias

*** Prediction is that crispy, high-water, quickly perishing luxury goods will be grown local with a transnational/national corp. The real value would be in high calorie staples, but seems unlikely (as well as unlikely to receive funding).

*** Ofc, advice is to continue centralizing at all costs.

*** I feel like one of the real strengths of my [[‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±]] boils down to the number of functions it can feasibly serve by hand convention. Zettel is necessary but insufficient. And, from I can tell, just getting words on the page that you find [[salient]] might be the best ML option (still vapor atm, but hard to argue that it's impossible).

*** Looks like a censorship machine to me, and top-down oppressive.
