!! How has your health been this week?

* 1uxb0x
** An unexpectedly large amount of bad sleep, with no particular reason. Also headaches as a result of that.
* j3d1h
** decent. sunburn is peeling, but it doesn't hurt or anything.
* k0sh3k
** Stressed and exhausted most of the week, but got all the things done. Headache until I got all the shots in the face. Belly pain at the end of the week, as well as a panic attack at church - fun times?
* h0p3
** Sleep is off again, but not bad. Mudbutt.
* ASK
** Everything hurts. More than it ought. I'm so weak. I want to say things like "I can't wait for my medical!" But that won't make much difference. I figure it out on my own or suffer.

** Lul, noooo
* A step closer to maybe some help with our insulation and other energy costs
* Found a way to redeem my EBT without the card. Did some shopping. 
* Went to DSS and did stuff. Took a survey. All the stars.
* Cried a bunch for Bean
** //Ender's Shadow//
*** (He stole my cryptic.)
**** What's a cryptic?
***** Anything that makes one scratch their heads. Particularly if they include an inside joke or suchlike. I do sometimes inside joke with myself. Too much time alone. 
****** Who canoe?
********And Tyler, too. (https://youtu.be/IFaRklAYanY)
********* Precisely! Well done!
* I've had an alright week, mainly because it was just kinda meh. I like the work I got done this week for math, but I still have room to improve. I'm in the mood for a game I don't know of which kinda sucks. My sleep has been reliably bad, and it has no good reason-perhaps just an unlucky streak, perhaps something else. The food has been great as well, thanks to ASK.

* 1uxb0x
** I've improved largely on my output. Gonna increase it some more.
** Your new [[private]] wiki is lookin' good, sir. I [[hope]] you shape it into something extremely useful to you. May it adaptively feel like climbing into a new skin or shell.

** Great job on your paper. I know it wasn't fun.
*** Thanks. I hate it.
