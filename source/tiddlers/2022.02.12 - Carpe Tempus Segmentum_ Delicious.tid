Art group until ~12:30. [[TTTOTW]]. Exhausted. Attempted sleep by 1?

Woke by 6:30? I did sleep some, but it doesn't feel like it. Racing. Gonna be okay, though not looking forward to recovering from the booster and all the other stuff I need to get done today without the sleep.

//Skintime// with my sympaticon + planning. Breakfast. She made coffee for me, and I had mandarins + curry. [[TTTOTW]].

I drove, so we arrived early because I risk everyone's lives for fun because I get bored so easily. =D. This place was anticipating a much greater turnout for the boosters, and there were only loose theories I could squeeze out of people for why the numbers were off. Quick and easy. I made a grill laugh by talking about being a neckbeard basement-dweller hiki. So, yeah, like, I've still got it. I'm cool like that.

We had chicken sammiches. They are insanely good. 

Grabbed coffee grounds, since we're here.

//The Walk// with mi amor and offspring on the old trail. It was amazing. Parents and offspring took turns, and they had plenty to tell me at a million miles an hour. I have missed walking with my offspring a fuck ton. I [[hope]] summer will provide us ample opportunity.

Shopping @ Burlington. I found a pair of utility shoes to replace my long-dead ones. We go so fucking fast through shoes (I tend to only wear a single pair, though I've got some workboots and flipflops), it's stupid. Son got some pants (because, yet again, just half a year later, that boy's pants don't fit him...stop fucking growing, loser). We've all been thinking about what it is like to be able to walk into a store without feeling stressed.

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. It's been a [[good]] day. //Inform the Men!//

Trying to find two weeks off in Summer to see [[JRE]] and [[DeathOfRobinhood]], [[k0sh3k]] included.

//Skintime// with my sympaticon + //ATLA// + [[TTTOTW]] + high fructose snack.
