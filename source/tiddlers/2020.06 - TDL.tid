!! Audit:

* Guess what: you are one horny sumbitch. You get off 2-3 times a day, ask for sex several times a day (probably 2-3 times a week as pure gifts to you), and that's sometimes all you can think about. It's almost pathological. Geschwindautist.
** I have been in a pussy-eating mood for a while now. 
* [[TW Canvassing]] has been pwning my time. I've met new folks though, and that's been great. 
** There's a reasonable chance that at least dozens of people have tried out TW because of my effort too. I feel like a skateboarder.
* Plans for shopping have fallen through pretty often, and [[Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση]] has had a high rate of failure.
* I feel like I'm completing 75% of what I set out to do, and that is still out of order.
* I'm grateful that I take the time to project ahead, even if my neckbeard, basement-dwelling days look so similar.
* You are slowly getting your offspring to own themselves. I do not claim you do a good job of it, but the evidence of progress is there.
* I am grateful that you take the time to chillax. You push a blistering manic pace.
** And, that may be a reasonable part of why your [[TDL]] is not what you wish it was.
* Heeyyy, you sent a [[letter]]! I'll sing the Blue's Clues song for you.
** Keep it up, dude. [[APonting]]'s letter just sits there. It's a good thing people give you so much time to get your autistic work done. You need it, understandably.
* Sometimes what I think you are doing here is helping an isolated set of your brain speak to the others as the words are filtered and interpreted in your [[phenomenology]]. Cooperate with yourselves, sir.
* You've had to ask yourself to vape, and you've also coincidentally tapered down on alcohol this month. I like the ~~effexor~~ effects, sir. 
* There's good effort in here. I think you should be pleased with yourself, and remember that you are still growing this thing. It takes time. 
** I [[hope]] you can help your offspring learn how to do this +9kx what you can in this sphere. Be humble (as we obviously should be here...[[2020.06.15 - TDL: Hit The Target No One Can See]]), and maybe the garden will grow for them.
* I appreciate the everydayness of [[TDL]]. It's hoomin.
* I feel like a glutton while reading this.
* I like the [[FTO]] pushes.
