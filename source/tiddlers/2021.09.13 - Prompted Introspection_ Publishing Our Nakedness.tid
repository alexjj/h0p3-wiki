title: 2021.09.13 - Prompted Introspection: Publishing Our Nakedness

!! If you could magically cause a neutral nude photo of every human to be published publicly on the internet every year on their birthday, would you?

No, not even for the lulz. I don't consider that being nearly [[naked]] enough. That information is prima facie morally arbitrary, and, hence, barely relevant in this context. Even given our [[embodied cognition]] and self-identification with our bodies, our flesh prisons aren't representative of what is most [[salient]] about our identities. I think that information would be misused, and I don't see the upshot here (not like I don't enjoy nude photos<<ref "s">>). This is not the fitting way to eliminate unjustified [[privacy]], which should be done in a scaling fashion.

In an absolutely ideal (into [[The Infinite]]) society, our "perfect" minds would be so transparent and connected that there would be no incentive to lie as there would be near perfect information for all players. The very knowledge of one's lie<<ref "l">> would be transmitted as well, and the implications would be known to all.<<ref "t">> Our intentions would be as bare as we could make them (though, of course, the [[infinigress]]ive problems of freewill remains, and there are limits to the [[dok]] to which we can even know our own intentions). [[Good]] [[faith]] collective computation of [[TOP]], even simplified to mere consequentialism, would be radically different if we could be so [[naked]] with each [[other]] that we could [[trust]] in at least the high likelihood of mass, sharded, woven, forcibly-honest cooperation. Part of what I value [[PSM]]ing for is in virtue of recognizing and pursuing this ideal.<<ref "a">>

Note, however, the difference between merely making the information public and actually getting people to collectively understand, care about, and weigh said information in a fitting manner. It's a matter of praxis. I think [[FTO]] requires [[wrestling]] and second-personal encounters. Perhaps all we can [[hope]] to accomplish is to lead by example. 

I think those in [[power]] are more accountable to [[PSM]]ing than anyone else. Flat, equal distributions may be too easily abused. Who could use that much information the fastest? Not anyone I [[trust]]. This is a hard problem. Obviously, I don't bet on people doing the right thing, not even the disenfranchised.

Bad players who could not be stopped would know they could not be stopped, and that would be known by all other players as well. There may be several nashes to consider, and it surely it gets harder to conceptualize with infinite resources.">>
