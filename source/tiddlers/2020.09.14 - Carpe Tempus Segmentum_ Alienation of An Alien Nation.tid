title: 2020.09.14 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Alienation of An Alien Nation

* Woke at 11
** Don't feel well-rested, but definitely can't sleep more.
** Just arguing with myself in my dreams. Sensory strip pressure.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Read+Watch
* Shopping at Aldis
** Offspring did most of the work and thought ahead. We're getting closer to them handling the process.
*** Perhaps in a few months, they will run the show from beginning to end, and I will quietly watch.
** Debit card is still not working well at that specific store. Would not go through today. I do not understand.
** Watermelon season is almost over. Still found two!
* Stopped at the giant store closing next door. They sell clothes. Offspring have never been in a store like it, so we thought about the prices, signals, and reasons for the objects. It was short. 
* Deepfreezer rubber seal lining is not doing well. There's a stickiness that shouldn't be there as well. Cleaning. Maybe should glue it.
* Read+Watch
* Encouragement and sitting with me. 
** Feeling better about my daughter today.
* [[JRE]] called. 
** Been a helluva weekend for him. 
** Matthew is at 104 fever. CV19 test, won't have results for a few days.
** Their justified resistance to take on another newborn is considered a redflag and may cause them to lose Matthew still.
*** Difficult to know the degree to which people are telling the truth. 
*** A story of a couple taking in 6 before there was any consideration of them having the right to say "no more."
*** Rebecca is extremely stressed, crying, understandably.
** Cancer test was negative for third time, and so they won't need to test him again.
** Considering switching up who will be working. Tough spot, but I think that makes sense.
** Was glad to hear from [[k0sh3k]].
* Read+Write+Watch
* That girl has been gettin' on Discord. That's the game. Time to tighten down more. Let's see if she finds another route.
** Asking to keep her "phone charged" at all times is super slick. Didn't smell right, but now I'm glad she wants the cover.
* Encouragement
* Nap
* Spoons with my wife for an hour.
** Listened to her about her day. Held her as she watched.
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Pizza, pierogies, veggies, pineapple, and coffee
** [[Debatable]]. Offspring were quieter than usual. We're giving our best answers. 4 questions in total.
