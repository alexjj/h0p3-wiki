You both like Philosophy, and Psychology.
You: Hello.
Stranger: Hey
You: What brings you here today?
Stranger: I need someone to talk to me
You: I can do that. What would you like to talk about?
Stranger: Do things get better?
You: I don't know. Sometimes.
You: I can say that my life has, but I know it could dip back down.
Stranger: Hopefully~
You: That's the key word. [[Hope]]. https://philosopher.life/#Hope
You: What's making it awful for ya?
Stranger: I’m just in my head a lot :(
You: Oh, I know that feel.
You: I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.
You: Though it can be quite painful.
Stranger: and I’m trying not to be a people pleaser
You: A tricky problem, no doubt.
Stranger: yes I’m always the one trying to make the peace
You: We ought to please at least some people (even if only idealized versions of them). It's part of practicing The Golden Rule. But, we have to guard our approval-seeking carefully.
You: That can be a costly thing to do. What do you feel like you sacrifice for that?
You: Does it have the results you look for?
Stranger: I feel like I have to sacrifice my own comfort for others to feel comfortable
Stranger: It’s tiring :(
You: What do you aim to do instead?
You: *if you can
You: I don't know anything about your situation.
Stranger: No one wants to
You: No one wants to what?
Stranger: As in the people in my life never bother
Stranger: Because to them I’m always smiling
You: What happens if you try to show or tell them what you're feeling and thinking?
Stranger: I have before
Stranger: It never ends well
You: You gotta have people to talk with, every day if you can. It's hard to find that, but I think it can be done.
You: I'm sorry that you aren't able to be intimate with the people around you.
You: That's very expensive.
You: I'm always down to talk, btw, if you ever need to. I'm an annoying person though, but I do listen.
Stranger: all I need is a hug honestly
Stranger: but
Stranger: any guy irl always wants more from me
Stranger: i hate it :(
You: Yeah. =/.
You: Skinhunger is a real need.
Stranger: :(
You: I don't know what to do in your shoes besides continue to hunt for the people that fit your life.
You: Even if you have to sift through a thousand people to find one that connects well with you, it's worth it.
Stranger: I hope so.
You: One thing that has helped me a lot is journaling. I've learned a lot doing it.
Stranger: I do that kind of
You: Writing every day, whether I want to or not, has done important work for me.
Stranger: But in my notes app
You: Yeah.
You: That's a journal.
You: What do you think matters most in life?
Stranger: Being good to people
You: Preach, yo.
You: A very, very expensive task.
Stranger: What about you?
Stranger: How is it expensive?
Stranger: It’s free
You: I would say [[The Good]] (https://philosopher.life/#The%20Good), and being moral to others, [[Love]] (https://philosopher.life/#Love).
You: I'm not sure what is actually free. There's usually a set of costs for anything.
You: I can say that being good to [[others]] (https://philosopher.life/#Find%20The%20Others) often requires major sacrifices. Material, time, my awareness, setting aside having fun to do something else less fun to me, etc.
You: Being good people is a vocation. I have to spend my life not on myself but on others who obviously have greater needs than I do.
You: I think being good to people requires the pursuit of [[Justice]] (https://philosopher.life/#Justice), and that means seeking it for every person on the planet. It means using my privilege to distribute [[power]] (https://philosopher.life/#Power) to those in profound need (including future persons).
You: I don't think I own myself, in the end. That's how expensive it is.
Stranger: makes sense.
Stranger: but it makes all the difference in people’s lives
Stranger: so, thank you~
You: `/salute`. It is my honor.
You: So, what do you do to survive in this world?
Stranger: I’m living with a roommate atm
Stranger: My mom kicked me out in November
You: Oh shit.
You: Why?
Stranger: I wasn’t listening to her
Stranger: and she didn’t accept me
You: That's gotta be exceptionally painful, especially during the pandemic.
You: I don't speak with my donors anymore, not directly at least. I can relate somewhat.
Stranger: donors?
You: Oh, my word for these people who gave birth to me.
Stranger: oh
You: Donated the genetic material, and so forth.
Stranger: I wish mine would speak to me though
You: I wish mine would even attempt to listen.
You: I do give them a chance to speak with me [[anonymous]]ly (https://philosopher.life/#Anonymous), and, for all I know, they have.
You: What would you want them to say to you?
Stranger: That they forgive me
Stranger: That they still care about me you know all those things parents should say
You: Yeah.
You: Give it time. Maybe things will change. You keep hunting.
You: Even I have [[hope]] for reconnecting one day with my own donors, however slim.
Stranger: I blame it on my (ex) friend who made me go against them
You: I'm a stranger in the desert here. I don't know your circumstances.
You: And, I believe that your friend is non-trivially responsible.
You: Do you think you should have listened to them because it was the right thing to do?
Stranger: those friends always planted thoughts in my head
Stranger: and started making me
Stranger: sneak behind my parents backs
Stranger: and do things
Stranger: that even today I’m trying to still forget
Stranger: you don’t really know something until ur body knows it
Stranger: and my body feels used
Stranger: it felt used
You: I see. That requires digestion. It takes time. Again, I do not know your circumstances.
You: Do you think your parents understand the influence your ex-friend had? Do they take your ex-friend to be solely responsible? Do they think you are responsible to some degree? Do you? I cannot say that being used is your fault.
Stranger: I can’t take back the things I did too
Stranger: Soo it’s my fault
You: Insofar as it is, it takes time to come to a place where we can forgive ourselves.
You: One of my favorite [[stoic]] phrases (https://philosopher.life/#Stoicism-fu) is "this too shall pass." Sometimes it's one night at a time.
You: There's this feller I like a lot, he wrote too much, but he said to his people this thing which sticks with me: "Love is such a priceless treasure that [we] can redeem [what remains of] the whole world by it, and cleanse not only [our] own sins but [some of] the sins of others."
You: I don't know if your relationship will heal, or if what you feel you've done that you can't take back can be fixed, but you can start again, keep marching, find the hidden [[gem]]s in the world.
Stranger: <3
You: <3 `/hug`
Stranger: ...
You: (keeping the conversation alive. I'm still here. Sitting quietly with you... -- I'll use the "..." for that too. And, if we disconnect, you can reach me here https://philosopher.life/#Contact%20h0p3.)
Stranger: can’t.
You: It loads very poorly on a phone or a slow connection. This is my Session Key: 05c17f4a9286f13dc5e57cc996b8f9b76a0767b0edab8d9ff425dbb34afd063a48 (getsession.org), and my e-mail is h0p3@protonmail.com.
Stranger: don’t.
You: ...
Stranger: I’m toxic
You: I don't believe you're toxic in a bad way, even if you made mistakes. You actually care. We all have good and bad parts to us. And, we are plastic creatures who can change. We aren't stuck.
Stranger: I’m stuck tho
Stranger: because they will always remember me as that
Stranger: ‘whore’
You: I gotta say, maybe they are wrong. That is not acceptable.
You: I can't say you did what was wrong either.
You: Maybe you wish you didn't do what you did, but you aren't toxic or evil necessarily for having broken social norms about sex.
You: Forgiveness for not listening, maybe. But, forgiveness for that...that doesn't sound right to me.
You: Parents aren't perfect either (and, lord knows, I'm a wildly flawed parent myself).
Stranger: a parent wouldn’t be proud of a daughter like me
Stranger: it’s embarrassing
You: I understand that they may feel ashamed, but I hold them in contempt for not embracing you. From where I stand, their honor and image are objectively less important than their relationship with you. They are non-trivially to blame, from the sounds of it.
You: And, still, it may heal. It takes time.
You: You may have to forgive them.
Stranger: but the numbers are in the doubles
You: So?
You: You are their daughter.
You: You are their offspring.
You: It doesn't matter how many people you had sex with. They should still love you and maintain a relationship with you.
Stranger: but they don’t
You: They are wrong for that.
Stranger: and haven’t called me or check on me once since
You: They are wrong for that.
Stranger: I’m wrong for that
You: It is possible that everyone has some measure of responsibility, but it's important to recognize that the approval you are seeking from them isn't based on their rational reasons. The failure of that relationship is not completely your fault, and it isn't exclusively your problem to fix. It can't be.
Stranger: but I’m getting worse without them
Stranger: Hating myself more
Stranger: For doing more of what made them hate me
You: Just as you hope to be a good person to others, you have to search for people who also aim to be good persons to you. People who don't seek to just use you, who only see you for your body - these people exist. You can find them. It sucks so badly to be alone. It's insanely painful.
You: And, I'm going to say it again: there is nothing obviously immoral about having had sex. I don't care if you had sex with triple digits; you are a person, a person with dignity. You matter.
Technical error: Lost contact with server, and couldn't reach it after 3 tries. Sorry. :( Omegle understands if you hate it now, but Omegle still loves you.

`/nod`. I'm trying to hold back because I'm not convinced they've done anything wrong, at least not in a [[FO]] sense. This person has been brainwashed, and I don't know how to give them the doorways they need fast enough. I don't how to be useful well enough. I wish you [[luck]], my friend. That is quite a mountain in the wilderness you are climbing. Being good to people means being good to yourself too, madame. Don't give up. Don't stop. Keep going. You can do it. Do your best. I don't know what words to say. I don't know what it means to pray to the universe, but it's my only out.
