How's your week going for ya?
Jun 4 9:35am

Hey sir. How are you doing? Had a rough week at work. Glad it's the weekend!
Jun 6 12:46pm
Hanging in there. Flooded. You know how it goes.
Jun 6 2:02pm
What made it a rough week?
Jun 6 2:02pm
Steep learning curve at work, made some mistakes, still not part of the "band" yet. Meh. I'll get there. Just stressful being the new guy outkast with no answers and lots of questions. Lol. Life goes on.
Jun 6 3:11pm
If I get let go or fired from this job it would be the first job I've ever been let go from not on my own terms.
Jun 6 3:11pm
What are you flooded with? School work?
Jun 6 3:11pm
That is stressful. =/.
Jun 6 4:47pm
Hopefully, they won't fire you.
Jun 6 4:55pm
You have probationary period to pass?
Jun 6 4:55pm
I'm flooded with school, reading, and writing. Yup.
Jun 6 4:56pm
I haven't passed the probation period. Haven't even been there a complete 2 months! Not jiving with the guys yet. I have reviewed all of options in my head. Helps with my anxiety. Lol.
Jun 6 5:06pm
I hope to pull myself up in this job and out of depression. Maybe get back to reading a book.
Jun 6 5:07pm
How long is probation?
Jun 6 5:08pm
3 months. It's all good. This too shall pass.

Good times
Jun 7 12:06am
Any shows standing out to you lately?
Jun 7 12:07am
Marco Polo on Netflix.
Jun 7 12:07am
Noice.
Jun 7 12:08am
You?
Jun 7 12:23am
Modern Love, but it quickly has gone downhill
Jun 7 12:23am
I still fall asleep to Rick and Morty.
Jun 7 12:23am
Lurv it
Jun 7 12:24am
I'll check it out. Never seen it. Waiting on the new orange is the new black season.
Jun 7 12:25am
That show was captivating.
Jun 7 12:26am
I've not seen it in a while.
Jun 7 12:26am
It goes down hill
 They all do.
Jun 7 12:27am
First season is usually the best.
Jun 7 12:27am
Seems to be the case.
Jun 7 12:27am
With Netflix and Hulu making their own series you get alot of 2-3 season shows that just die.
Jun 7 12:28am
Wife and I were just talking. Wondering if Netflix series actors make as much as mainstream network shows.
Jun 7 12:29am
It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Venture Bros., China Il, 3rd Rock from the Sun, and The Newsroom have been solid exceptions ot that rule.
Jun 7 12:29am
I have no idea.
Jun 7 12:29am
Indeed. Have always enjoyed those shows.
Jun 7 12:30am
Southpark is a staple. I fell asleep to them for years. Lol
Jun 7 12:30am
I don't follow that space much, but from what I can tell, acting prestige is to be found in the golden age of shows (which seems to continue for now).
Jun 7 12:31am
I find cartoons comforting, even in my 30s.
Jun 7 12:31am
I do as well. When I quit smoking weed family guy stopped being funny though. Haha
Jun 7 12:32am
That show never came back right.
Jun 7 12:33am
Futurama and Arrested Development had that problem too
Jun 7 12:33am
I still love futerama.
Jun 7 12:33am
Yeah, I fall asleep to that one too. There is an entire subreddit devoted to that. Falling asleep to Futurama, lol.
Jun 7 12:33am
Haha I've been there too! Funny. I remember when they took it off Netflix I freaked.
Jun 7 12:35am
But it was on Hulu. I haven't watch in awhile
Jun 7 12:35am
If you ever need shows, let me know.
Jun 7 12:35am
I am guilty of wasting way too much time in front of a television.
Jun 7 12:36am
It's a great drug
Jun 7 12:36am
It goes great with all other drugs too.
Jun 7 12:37am
Stacking power
Jun 7 12:37am
Hittin the sauce tonight
Jun 7 12:37am
My wine tastes like yogurt.
Jun 7 12:37am
I had a few earlier. Suppose to be on call in the morning.
Jun 7 12:38am
Suppose to read a chapter of an aircraft maintenance manual before Monday. Vibration analysis.
Jun 7 12:39am
How Boomer Top-heavy is the aircraft maintenance industry at this point?
Jun 7 12:40am
(presumably it is)
Jun 7 12:41am
Like many other.
Jun 7 12:41am
I don't think I will be in the industry for much longer. A few more years maybe. The stress is too much. Sad to have that many years invested. But I'm burnt out.
Jun 7 12:43am
Hopefully, your skills become rare enough that you could command a lower stress environment, but I doubt it. =/
Jun 7 12:44am
You are extra stressed right now, understandably.
Jun 7 12:44am
Not a fan of a careless mistake to costs people's lives. And being rushed to complete jobs simultaneously.
Jun 7 12:44am
Yeah. Fuck that.
Jun 7 12:44am
Agreed. I'm just gonna keep trying to play the dumb card.  Maybe I'll get fired.
Jun 7 12:46am
lol. I hope not. I would be surprised.
Jun 7 12:46am
Probabaly succeed and just be stuck lol
Jun 7 12:46am
I have it easier on this front. My mission is almost guaranteed to fail, lol. I just do what I can, and the rest isn't up to me.
Jun 7 12:47am
Buy you keep pushing and striving and moving forward.
Jun 7 12:49am
Most people wouldn't begin to try.
Jun 7 12:49am
I'm hoping that 30 years from now, we will both have an awesome story.
Jun 7 12:50am
*assuming we live that long, lol
Jun 7 12:50am
btw, how are you feeling about the social/political/economic position where you're at right now? Even just your gut feeling
Jun 7 12:52am
Things are slowly opening up here
Jun 7 12:52am
Stores are stocked again and there are more people out and about.
Jun 7 12:53am
Yeah. We went to Walmart today. Workers wearing masks, below their chin. Restaurants at 30% capacity.  We are making our way thu all the canned food I bought. Still. Haven't had to buy toilet paper yet. Maybe another week or two. Lol
Jun 7 12:54am
I got a bidet gun. Highly recommend. Asshole has never been cleaner.
Jun 7 12:55am
Wife says (from clients) alot of. People don't wanna go back to work cause with  unploymwmr plus $600 a week they are making more. But we nothe know that is all. Short term.
Jun 7 12:56am
Lots of places are in need of workers that were laid off.
