* Tacos al pastor
** Never made 'em before. We'll see how it goes. I'm excited. Cheap to make, and they are delicious.
* We could go shopping, but I think it is still best to wait. 
** I want to hit Costco first.
*** Assuming it's there when we arrive.* XD.
* [[Monthly Auditable]]s
** Would be amazing if you just knocked it out.
* Ugh. [[Hegel]] for [[Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση]]. Who did this to me?
* You should chat with folx. You do pull your weight. Keep doing so.
