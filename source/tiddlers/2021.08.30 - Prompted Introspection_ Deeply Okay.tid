title: 2021.08.30 - Prompted Introspection: Deeply Okay

!! If you could press a button that would make you feel deeply and permanently that everything was ok, would you? Assume that you'd remain functional in the world.

I'm not convinced that is a coherent possibility. Without anxiety to some [[dok]], we cannot experience its opposite, nor can we be sufficiently motivated. Even a functionalist is unlikely to think one would function in that circumstance, unless it was just to sit there. I think we can work toward The Calm (or better), but we can't erase the lack of feeling that not everything is okay without just erasing ourselves. It's part of us. We aren't [[The Absolute]] (though we may be a part of it), and intentionality drives toward such a thing.<<ref "p.s.">>

<<footnotes "p.s." "[[k0sh3k]] has pointed out that the consequences of the argument are such that if we were to remain functioning in some sense, pressing the button would have to change the world. Insofar as that is cogent and correct, then I would press the button.">>
