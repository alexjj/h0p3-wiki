** Hey, where's the script you wrote? That should at least be in here.
*** I think it makes more sense to make its own .xsh tiddler.
**** Don't forget to tag.

** I'd like to see you be more explicit and detailed. 
*** I'm going to make a macro for this. `/hr-deets` maybe?

** I suggest I want time more than almost any other resource. It is often the case that I'm going to think of the conversion of various resources into how much time it costs (for whom, and so forth). Yeah, universal resource makes sense.
*** This phrase "everyone understands time" will be worth your inspection. If there were different levels or kinds of understanding, some of them more tacit or unconscious than others (or some just as kind of awareness or perception), it seems like //time// is something that must always be understood or reckoned with in some way. It appears we cannot be aware of anything without already having this category or structure imposed on our [[phenomenology]]. 
** From a practical perspective, it seems like we measure time about as well as we measure space. There may even be neurons devoted to being a metronome or timer in you.

** The physical category, process, concept, or instantiation of time might not change, though relativity will require you to say more how "time is fixed." For us, whether we are on the lowest or highest point of the crust, we can't perceive the difference.  The question is about the [[phenomenology]] of time, as you point out. It's a great answer.

** What are you hoping will happen in //Brave New World//?
*** You want a bad ending? lol. why? Why should I think that is the best way for a character to express themselves?
**** I think that expressing ourselves while we are at our worst is an important part of completing the kaleidoscope of who we are. What we choose to do with our pain, suffering, grief, feelings of meaninglessness, fear, and anger enable us to describe, apply, and instantiate [[The Good]] in ways that conceptually could not occur otherwise. 
***** Similar to how fair-weather friends aren't complete friends. 
***** Expressing ourselves while we experience various positive states is just as necessary for painting the picture of who we are too though. When you're flush, when you've got a full harvest, when you're high, when you're filled with joy and wonder: what do you choose to do with these gifts?
*** Why do you want the government in the book overthrown?
** Thanks for staying up a bit later to work on the project with me. I had fun.
*[[Cooking of the Future]]
** Tag it. You all have been on this "future" kick. Why?
*** Okay, why do you think she's picking it out?

** You should consider compiling a list for [[2018/06/16 -- To-Do List Log]] drawing ideas. Have a single home for it.
