title: Virtue is Knowledge

//See: [[Axioms of h0p3]]//

A teenage boy asked the master "How do I compose a symphony?"

The master said "You're too young, you need to start with more modest projects."

"But master" said the boy "you first composed a symphony when you were half my age!"

"Yes, but I didn't ask anyone how."

The scholar, having to encounter doubts and difficulties on all hands, [...] learns to take nothing for granted; least of all, to make an assumption of his own superior merits. [...] It takes years of patient toil and devoted enthusiasm to master any art or science; and after all, the success is doubtful. He infers that other triumphs must be prepared in like manner at an humble distance: he cannot conceive that any object worth seizing on or deserving of regard, can be carried by a coup de main. [...] It never once enters his head (till it is too late) that impudence is the current coin in the affairs of life; that he who doubts his own merit, never has credit given him by others; [...] that the world judge by appearances, not by realities; and that they sympathize more readily with those who are prompt to do themselves justice, and to show off their various qualifications or enforce their pretensions to the utmost. [...] He who has spent the best part of his time and wasted his best powers in endeavouring to answer the question -- 'What is truth?' -- scorns a lie, and every thing making the smallest approach to one. His mind by habit has become tenacious of, devoted to the truth.

-- William Hazlitt, //The Shyness of Scholars//

From my standpoint: 

//Virtue is Knowledge//

[[<=>]]

//[Virtue] is [Wisdom] is [A Unique, Normative Kind of Practical Knowledge]//

[[<=>]]

//[Virtue (for me)] is [Wisdom (for me)] is [Knowledge (for me is my habiturally trained [[intuitions networks|Intuition Networks]]) in our [[fastmind|Fastmind]]]//

[[<=>]]

//Virtue is Intuition//

Or, perhaps Virtue isn't really knowledge, it's a very special kind of knowledge. Virtue requires developing excellence/mastery embedded in the Intuition networks of our fastmind. This is our moral psychology. 

This is incredibly in line with the literature. The Triune Greek Philosopher Gods were fucking geniuses. They were incredibly in touch with who they were to have deduced what they did with what little evidence they had.

[[RPIN]]: ....or....that is the natural state of memetic evolution. You are just getting in tune with the ancient beast inside you (that set of intuitions we are born with from evolution, embedded in ), the oldschool natural way, but now you know far more about these beasts and should take up a different position that people who lived thousands of years ago.

Virtue is Knowledge is concerned with the relationship between Theory and Practice.
