You both like psychology.
You: Hello!
Stranger: Hi
You: What brings you here today?
Stranger: Just wanted to talk to strangers
Stranger: How about you?
You: I want to talk to strangers as well. I do so because I'm trying to [[Find The Other]], for lack of a better phrase.
You: Sometimes it works out.
Stranger: Oh sure; haha
You: Do you come here often?
Stranger: No
Stranger: Do you?to [find the other] haha;
You: For the past couple weeks, during my workdays (well, really late at night usually), yes.
You: Also, this may provide context: https://philosopher.life/#Find%20The%20Others
Stranger: Have you found anyone yet?
You: [[Foobar]] is a [[link]] in the wiki.
You: Definitely. You can check the [[Anonymous]] section to see.
You: From what I can see, it tends to be more successful than other [[anon]]ymized social platforms, like 4chan.
You: Still, the failure rate is considerable. I'm still learning to use the platform in a way that maximizes success.
Stranger: What has been your results so far?
You: Hard to narrow it down fast enough. I pointed you to the results. There are particular people I have long conversations with, and some that have even continued speaking with me well after meeting me on omegle. [[Nemo]], [[ThisDoesNotExist]], [[5t3v3]], and [[66912]] are [[recent]] examples.
Stranger: How old are you?
You: I'm 36. How about you?
Stranger: 24
You: Noice. That's a good age.
Stranger: Where are you from?
You: I'm from the US, and you?
You: (all over the US, that is*)
Stranger: And, I am from India; btw
You: Cool. How's life going in India at the moment?
Stranger: Fine, how about you?
You: I tend to be [[lucky]] enough to encounter many people from your nation on this platform.
You: Yeah. I can't complain, locally.
Stranger: Well; we are over a billion of us, it's not hard to find us anywhere; haha
You: That is true. I assume that over time, a significant portion of my online friends will be from Asia.
You: I used to live relatively close by, in Thailand.
Stranger: Cool
You: It was quite an experience.
You: So, you're interested in psychology, yeah? What parts of it interest you?
Stranger: Haha; I can imagine
Stranger: I like the intricacies it has to offer
Stranger: How about you?A quick glance at that link that you sent me tells me you like 'allophilia'?
You: I am interested in what it means to have a mind and mind like ours. I cannot say I understand who we are well enough.
You: Allophilia is an interest, yes.
Stranger: What exactly does that mean?
You: Which part?
Stranger: Liking for allies?
Stranger: Allophilia?
You: Oh, well, I take myself to wrestling with what it means. I suggest that The Golden Rule is concerned with empathizing and taking into account in our weighing and prioritizing the mental states and models of [[The Other]] as best as we can.
Stranger: What do you do for work btw?
You: As you'll find in [[Contact h0p3]], I'm concerned with making sure that we protect our outgroups.
You: I read and write, I run my household, and I [[homeschool]] my [[offspring|Be A Good Dad]].
You: How do you survive in this world? What do you find fulfilling to pour your effort and energy into?
Stranger: That doesn't answer my question, but okay
Stranger: I am a junior doctor
You: Why do you feel it does not answer your question?
Stranger: 'What do you do for work'?
Stranger: that one?
You: I grant I am not the most skilled interpreter.
Stranger: It would normally mean that someone is enquiring your occupation
You: I am a formally trained analytic philosopher. I used to be a teacher in many settings, including university. I continue my work as vocation, though I do not make money from it.
Stranger: Why were you staying in Thailand before?
You: I was teaching and I was helping build an orphanage for children who were being trafficked in the sex trade industry.
You: Do you enjoy your work as a doctor?
Stranger: And what caused you to move to a different country?
Stranger: Yes;I do; haha
You: Noice. What do you enjoy most about it?
Stranger: Perspectives of everyone I come across
Stranger: In my work; that is
You: I moved because I felt I had the chance to do some good in a way that I could not in my area at the time. It was a transformative experience for me.
Stranger: Are you a single dad?
You: I can imagine you engage in conversations with more people than average, probably in higher stakes matters than average too.
Stranger: Sometimes;
You: I've been married to [[my wife]] for almost two decades.
Stranger: Alright
Stranger: you got married at 16?
You: How about you? How's your family unit?
You: 19*
Stranger: Alright
Stranger: I am single;
Stranger: Just matching what you told me btw;
You: In what manner?
Stranger: Talking about a partner and a family unit with him/her
Stranger: I am single in that aspect as yet; haha
You: Ah. I see. Well, I'd be interested to know what relationships you have that matter to you deeply.
You: Sometimes that is through blood relation or marriage, but it need not be at all, to my eyes.
Stranger: The ones I share with my family and my closest friends;
Stranger: are you there?
You: Yes. I am listening.
Stranger: Well; I told you what I was wanting to
You: I see.
Stranger: I asked you a question; haha
You: Which one?
Stranger: You: So do you use your savings to run your household as you said earlier?or do you do something else that can be classified as an occupation?
Stranger: Did you not get that text?
You: Ah, that message did not arrive.
You: I learn new things about Omegle every day.
You: My wife earns enough for us to pay for that which costs money.
Stranger: Alright
You: My work is classifiable as an occupation, though the manner in which I engage in it is non-standard.
Stranger: Sure
Stranger: So what exactly is a formally trained analyst philosopher?
You: Analytic philosophy may be a branch of [[The Great Human Conversation]] that traces through the anglophone world since Saint Kant.
You: Presumably, those with the fitting diplomas to engage in research and write papers that can be published in what are considered the journals of the discipline, and those who teach it in post-secondary settings, are formally trained.
You: That said, I think plenty of the best philosophers I've encountered aren't people with these pieces of paper.
Stranger: You used those words 'formally trained'; I was asking you, what makes you one?
You: I meet the conditions I've stated.
Stranger: Alright
Stranger: What does your wife do?for work?
You: She's a librarian.
Stranger: Alright
Stranger: Has your child always been home schooled?
You: Yes. From the beginning.
Stranger: Alright
You: Do you encounter many people who engage in homeschooling where you live?
You: I know very little about the practice worldwide.
Stranger: I have not met any personally, but there are plenty who do
Stranger: I have heard that is;
Stranger: So, your website; why does it have a huge rainbow on the home page?
You: I [[like]] it. It's pretty. =)
Stranger: and why is it in the font that it is in?
You: What do you find [[beautiful]] in this world?
Stranger: Empathy; to name one
You: It allows me to hold a lot of text on my screen all at once, I enjoy the style, and I make use of the monospacing often enough.
Stranger: Alright; why do use []
Stranger: for specific words or things
Stranger: ?
Stranger: *you
You: [[Foobar]] is a link in my wiki. You can search the term up, if you wanted. [[Find The Others]] is the name of a page (though it also has aliases).
Stranger: I just did, thanks haha;
You: I try to provide context, to maximize [[intimacy]]. Some people review our conversations on the ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî± and find a window into it. It is a very, very large body of text.
You: Not a problem.
You: Do you have anything pseudonymized that I might be able to read or digest?
Stranger: I have some on instagram
You: [[Public Self-Modeling]] is an expensive task, I realize. I'd prefer that you maintain your [[anonymity]].
Stranger: It's a clandestine thing I chose to have on the internet; haha; I don't really share a lot of my writing on the internet for no reason tbh;
You: Are you saying you don't have a reason not to share your writing?
Stranger: Do you like using well, presumably old technology things?
Stranger: I am;
You: Uh, sometimes, yeah. I suppose it depends on what you mean. I am a fan of tools and instruments.
You: I cannot say I'm terribly skilled. I used to be a pipefitter, and I played piano and clarinet considerably.
Stranger: I mean, foobar is something not many people my age would know;
You: I agree that it is an odd word.
Stranger: Neither would someone my age be used to a website designed like the one you linked me to
Stranger: It screams 2000s
You: Oh, well, perhaps no one is familiar with my kind of site.
You: I hope it screams something even older.
Stranger: I used to see yours in the 2000s haha;
Stranger: Alright
Stranger: cool;
You: It does have an older style to it, I agree.
Stranger: I was just being honest; not rude btw
You: I respect your honesty. That is the basis of a relationship that counts. =)
Stranger: Glad haha;
You: Do you have an interests in older technologies?
Stranger: I like technology, I won't say I have a particular interest in the old kind for sure though;
Stranger: It's just the beauty of how things change;
Stranger: I like to learn from; tbh
You: Yes. That makes sense. There's a lot to learn in studying why and how the world [[change]]s.
You: Do you have any cherished examples that stand out to you as a doctor?
Stranger: Sure;
Stranger: Regards to technology you mean?
You: Yes.
Stranger: Haha; I like the ease cell phones have provided;
You: hell yeah, lol
Stranger: Haha;
You: I can't imagine trying to do half of the shit we do without our [[phones|Pinephone]].
You: I'd like to know your predictions about the future of your discipline as well. Do you think [[machine learning|Aispondence]] will revolutionize parts of your work?
Stranger: Oh haha;
Stranger: It seems to be promising in some things
You: Like a mathematician's proof assistant, do you see MLed diagnostics as being crucial tools for at least some future formally trained‚Ñ¢ doctors?
Stranger: Haha; why that eery reference?
You: I think it's cute. =D.
Stranger: Haha; electronics?
You: I'm sorry, I don't understand the question. Please elaborate.
Stranger: Nvm
Stranger: Mled?
Stranger: what's that?
You: Machine Learned
Stranger: Ah
Stranger: Makes more sense now;
Stranger: And yes, in some ways sure seems that way
You: Oh, I suppose I have a more pressing question: how do you think and feeling about Covid in India? I was recently speaking with my friend [[Variety Creepy]] about this.
You: (or, that may be a fatiguing question, we can move onto something else)
Stranger: Sure
Stranger: What's your name?
You: My name is h0p3.
You: It's an honor to meet you, [[nomad]].
Stranger: Haha
Stranger: Is your wife thai?
You: No. She is an Amerimutt, like myself, with heavy lines of German and Romani in her.
Stranger: Haha;
Stranger: Intentional sarcasm or not; that was funny
You: Gracias. =D
Stranger: De nada;
You: I'm autistic, so I have to be extra careful in how reason about sarcasm.
Stranger: How tall are you?
Stranger: Sure
You: I'm a manlet. I'm 5'7"...if you can believe it, I've lost height as I've aged.
Stranger: alright
You: I look forward to a generation that will tower over me. My wife is short as well, for where we live.
Stranger: How many kids do you have?
You: Is height a key factor in how social interactions play out in India?
Stranger: No haha; not really; haha
You: I have two. [[1uxb0x]], my son, is 13. [[j3d1h]], my daughter, is 15.
Stranger: Alrighty
You: There seems to be non-trivial [[bias]] for height where I live.
Stranger: How tall are your kids?
You: They are both about 5'5"ish.
Stranger: Alright
You: I predict they will be taller than me. What do you think?
Stranger: Sure;
You: So you've been using the interwebs for quite a while. You do happen to have any links that seem worth checking out?
You: I'm kinda a linkslut. People have to pick out what is [[salient]] for me on the internet. It's how I come to understand people, in part.
Stranger: Define links?
Stranger: 'linkslut'?
Stranger: interesting word, quite unexpected from you haha;
You: I suppose a name that can be resolved to a server that distributes information. For example, https://www.omegle.com would count as a link.
Stranger: Haha; aw
You: Oh, well, I swear like a sailor, I'm incredibly lewd.
Stranger: And you are definitely old school at heart haha;
Stranger: 'swear like a sailor';
Stranger: 'swear like a rapper'
Stranger: is more up and coming; js;
You: In my experience, both are excellent at swearing. XD.
You: Updating my language may be valuable.
Stranger: sure
You: I do try to stick with it. [[SURFER GOD AARDVARK TRANSLATION: YOU PEOPLE FDUCKING DISGUSTMEMe xD]]
You: I'm just not turbly good at maymaying sometimes.
You: Only the retarded have the patience to interpret my schizospergs. :P
You: So, how many languages do you speak?
Stranger: Five
You: God dayum, son!
You: That's crazy [[awe]]some.
Stranger: gee thanks
You: I'm jelly. I wish I could. I've tried and failed to learn many languages.
You: How many did know by the time you were 12?
Stranger: um 4
You: Wow. That's quite a gift.
Stranger: I grew up trilingual tbh
You: Does it serve you well as a doctor these days?
Stranger: Yes
Stranger: Two are european though, so not very where I am rn; haha
You: Have you spent much time outside of India?
Stranger: I travel yes, I have never 'lived' in another place besides my city though;
You: Do you [[hope]] to live in your city for the rest of your days?
You: It can be gift to have roots in one place, I think.
Stranger: I don't put a cage on myself; but sure
You: What are some conditions under which you would prefer to move?
Stranger: It offers me more than what I have, in every sense important to me;
You: Ah, okay. What are those senses?
Stranger: Personal relationships, and professional ooprtunities
Stranger: *opportunities
You: It seems easier to know the latter rather than the former, unless you engage in significant online interactions with people.
You: Do you have much cross-over from your online interactions into offline ones?
Stranger: I don't really;
Stranger: and none, so far
You: I have little experience in it myself.
Stranger: I am old school that way; maybe haha
You: That makes sense. There's something to be said for it.
You: What do you enjoy doing with your freetime? Do you have much freetime? Many of the doctors I've met have extremely busy schedules.
Stranger: Rn, I can get some spare
Stranger: I usually read or write, sketch, cook
You: Do you consider yourself a homebody?
Stranger: Probably
Stranger: I love to move around thoug
Stranger: *h
You: You like to walk, or what kinds of physical activities do you enjoy?
Stranger: I love yoga, walk, strength train haha; love a bit of badminton too
You: Yeah, can't do all of those at home, I assume.
Stranger: some yes; haha
You: Been a long time since I played badminton. Terrible at it. Do you get to play often, and who with?
Stranger: I do, usually my siblings or friends
You: Noice. How many siblings do you have? What are they like?
Stranger: One; haha
Stranger: I meant my sibling and his partner
Stranger: They are really nice; haha
You: I have two, [[JRE]] and [[AIR]]. It's very rare to have people who know our stories. They are [[power]]ful people in my life. I [[hope]] my own offspring will be the best of [[friends|Friendship]] for as long as they live.
You: I think as we age, it gets harder and harder to try to communicate the stories of who we are with each other. It's a flood of information. It's easier as a kid on the playground.
Stranger: sure
Technical error: Server was unreachable for too long and your connection was lost. Sorry. :( Omegle understands if you hate it now, but Omegle still loves you.

A different encounter. I doubt this one considerably. Maybe a STEMlord, perhaps high-caste (though, not nearly as educated as [[Variety Creepy]]), and interesting confidence. Not limply, this one defensively (and perhaps cynically) said almost as little as possible. You have my attention, interrogator. `/salute`. Perhaps they came to wrestle about linguistic normativity without putting their skin in the game, let alone picking out a theory. I can appreciate being hedged-conservative in speaking with a madman in the desert. Welp, I [[hope]] we meet again.

You both like Psychology.
Stranger: hey, what would make you beat the shit out of someone?
You: Hello!
You: I just want to check you are there. I'm happy to answer.
Stranger: yea i am
You: There are likely many sufficient conditions for me beating the shit out of someone, and I think violence comes in degrees and kinds. One clear example would be saving the life of a child that could only be saved through violence.
You: How about you?
Stranger: i think it's mostly self preservation for me
You: Have you had to fight people before in your life?
Stranger: would all your reasons involve immediate danger like that?
Stranger: yeah i did
You: That is an expensive thing to do.
You: I am not convinced it would always have to be in virtue of immediate danger (although it depends on how we define danger).
You: How did your fights go?
Stranger: gone from being hospitalized myself to making the other person beg for mercy and still continuing the beating.
Stranger: but i can't say i'm the same person i was back then
You: How do you feel about that encounter now?
Stranger: which one?
You: Both of them. Sorry, I misunderstood.
Stranger: when i was hospitalized or when i was the aggressor?
Stranger: the one i was assaulted, i think i was very stupid to have misread the situation on how aggressive the people involved actually are. i was young and naive
You: You don't feel like you deserved it though, right?
Stranger: the other one, i do not like myself for what i did. it's something i would like to avoid at all costs
Stranger: i don't believe in the concept of deserving things
You: Oh.
You: That's surprising.
Stranger: why is that?
You: Well, most people who have told me that ultimately do seem to hold some positions on rights and obligations, however minimal they may be.
Stranger: i used to be the same. there were certain people i looked at with contempt and disgust who i thought deserved to be in pain
Stranger: i don't see the world the same way anymore
Stranger: what about you? have you ever been in a fight?
You: Uh, I don't mean that people deserve to be in pain. One can deserve not to be hurt by others in at least some contexts. Some people may even have the right to defend themselves (which is a kind of desert).
You: I have been in physical fights, and I think these come in degrees.
You: None that were too damaging to our bodies.
You: I often come right up to the line of physical violence.
You: But, I don't want to cross it. I hate crossing it.
You: You appear to be copy and pasting your question. How have other people responded to you today?
Stranger: it's a script actually
Stranger: i'm too lazy to do it myself
Stranger: i've had different responses
You: Oh, neat. What kind of script?
Stranger: everything from pacifism to sadism
Stranger: just auto pastes that and auto disconnects if someone disconnects
You: Are you running multiple tabs?
Stranger: only talking to you at the moment
You: I've not looked much into scripting on Omegle. I've encountered some interesting bots.
You: It's hard for me to pick out what I would want to automate.
Stranger: oh i don't know much either, it's just what little coding skills i learnt back in school
You: Oh, cool. I wish they taught me that in school.
Stranger: i don't think i even know how to make this anymore. this was years ago
You: Well, 6 months go by, and nobody can read their code anymore.
Stranger: haha yeah.
You: So, what do you do to survive in the world? And, what makes your life worth living?
Stranger: what about you?
You: Sorry, about what? (I might have missed a message. Sometimes Omegle fails to send correctly.)
Stranger: you didn't get my message about what i do?
You: I didn't.
Stranger: i teach self defense, study psychology. i'm not sure if there's anything in particular that makes my life worth living. maybe curiosity
You: Omegle is a buggy place, lol.
Stranger: yeah it is
You: I read and write, try to be useful to people. This is me: https://philosopher.life/. My name is [[h0p3]]. It's a pleasure to meet you.
You: As to what makes it worth living, I [[aim]] to understand [[The Other]], to seek [[Justice]], and to live [[curiously|Question Everything]].
Stranger: nice to meet you too
You: So what kinds of tools do you hand your students when you teach self-defense? What parts of psychology interest you?
Stranger: their body and their mind mostly. and when it comes to psychology, it's mostly behavioral.
Stranger: so, you read and write about philosophy mostly?
You: Oh, I'm not sure how to say it fast enough. I read and write about everything. There's plenty of formal philosophy in it, but I'd say my journaling ([[Carpe Tempus Segmentum]]) and [[Link Log]]s are examples of practices that aren't standardly conceived of as philosophy (though, I'm willing to accept broad definitions).
Stranger: i see
You: Behavioral psych is an interesting place. Some people I've met do not find it has much credence, but I think that's mistaken. It can be a bleak affair, but there seems to be plenty to learn about who we are in that branch.
You: Do you have any particular places in behavioral psych that I should think about?
Stranger: i only go to uni part time because of work but i started working on my own paper last year. it's about how crime evolves on an individual level. for example, how someone who starts out with things like making fun of another person could over their lifetime evolve into someone who does things like rape and human trafficking
Stranger: i think the evolution and shaping of behavior and mindsets is something that is very deep and fascinating. i'm only beginning to understand and learn about it myself
You: I can see why we should be worried about that problem.
You: Do you enjoy attending school?
Stranger: well, it's been around forever, it can;t really get any worse but yeah. it's something to be worried about for sure
You: Omegle sometimes conks out right here, throws up a technical error (and I don't know why). This message is to ensure they don't close down our session.
Stranger: you didn't get any of my messages ?
You: None.
You: =/.
You: Hrm.
You: That is annoying.
You: Do you mind copy and pasting what you sent?
Stranger: i do. it's a special class for people who are working so it only has those who really want to be there. and i think that makes it better for me
Stranger: how about now?
You: Yes, I saw that. Thank you.
Stranger: yeah, so what about you? work? school?
You: It's much better to be in a class where everyone wants to be there!
You: I read and write. I [[homeschool]] my [[offspring|Be A Good Dad]].
You: I used to teach as well.
You: I very much enjoy school, but it's probably not the fitting place for me at the moment.
You: I spend enormous amounts of time online. I learn on my [[machine|monster]].
You: I have a feeling I have missed your message(s).
Stranger: i see. i used to spend all my time on work. but the pandemic forced a much needed break on me
You: Ah, saw it.
Stranger: i think it's your internet maybe? i've never had it happen this many times before haha
You: It could be. I am not sure yet.
You: I'm glad that the pandemic gave you a break. How have you spent that time?
Stranger: got more into psychology.
Stranger: what about you? how did you spend your time being forced to stay at home?
You: A difficult place to study, no doubt. Over half the studies in the standard literature cannot be replicated. It's a crisis.
You: I have been [[lucky]] enough to stay home for several years. My life, in most direct respects, was barely altered by the pandemic. I'm a hikikomori who lives in his basement. =).
Stranger: i see. and how do you feel about your life?
You: I [[like]] my life in a local sense. Globally, I am quite worried.
You: Part of my work is about solving some hard problems, and I do not predict success.
You: I'm [[grateful]] to have my family and the opportunities that I have.
Stranger: what kind of problems do you solve?
You: Do you have any significant other(s) in your life, or what relationships matter most to you?
Stranger: i have my family but no romantic relationship at the moment
You: I work on problems concerned with [[privacy]], decentralizing [[power]], [[voting]], and [[justice]] at the intersection of classical philosophy and technology.
Stranger: what kind of justice are you talking about here?
You: Finding lasting relationships with depth, sincerity, and [[intimacy]] can be quite difficult these days.
You: [[Justice]] is not simple to define. Roughly, I take it to be about computing a resolution to our competing desires and concepts of [[The Good]], particularly of [[Humanity]]. You could classify me as a Neo-Rawlsian Marxist.
You: I work to secure distributed governance, democracy, to represent people using the tools available to us.
You: I cannot say I'm skilled at it or that I'm succeeding.
Stranger: i see, that is interesting
You: You definitely have met a madman in the desert on this here interwebs. =)
You: So, what's the demographics of your self-defense students?
Stranger: don't have any particular except be old enough for it. our youngest is 16 years old and oldest is in their 40s
Stranger: usually early 20s though.
You: That's cool. How did you up becoming trained in self-defense?
You: end up*
You: We may have had a disconnect, I don't know.
Stranger: how did i learn personally? mostly getting in fights and losing. but i also learned a lot from my uncle who raised me. he was in the military and had a ton of experience in unarmed combat in particular
Stranger: now?
You: I see it. Thank you.
You: I can imagine you and your uncle have lots to talk about on this subject. You do you get to see him often?
You: Not everyone in the military has a ton of experience with unarmed combat, so learning from him must have been a privilege.
Stranger: no, he lives with his family now. i live in a different part of the world.
You: Oh. I see.
Stranger: yeah unarmed combat is a specialization, it's not really a common thing in armed forces haha
You: Where do you live now? I live in New England, US.
Stranger: i live in singapore
You: Oh, that's cool as hell.
Stranger: is it?
You: Seems so different. I've read some about the nation.
You: What do you think of it?
Stranger: i think it's fine. what stood out to you the most?
You: It's small, seemed relatively orderly, maybe even strict in social and legal conventions. My offspring learned part of their mathematics through curriculum that is purported to have originated in Singapore schools (and, indeed, their test scores seem relatively high).
You: I've never visited.
Stranger: i see. interesting, most people i asked that question go directly to our justice system and caning as a punishment in particular
You: What stands out the most to you about it? How long have you resided there? How did you come to find yourself living there?
Stranger: did you not get my previous message?
You: last message I received: "Stranger: i see. interesting, most people i asked that question go directly to our justice system and caning as a punishment in particular"
Stranger: yeah, i also asked if that doesn't bother you
Stranger: and for me i like it here. it's relatively safe, plenty of opportunities and politically neutral on the world stage
You: I'm not terribly convinced retributive justice is fitting, though [[Gradual]]ized [[T42T]] approaches to iterated prisoner's dilemmas implies that such defection may be necessary in some cases. Restorative justice seems far more fitting to me. I do not have an opinion about Singapore's effectiveness.
You: I think justice requires at least examining the gini-coefficient, preventing caste societies, and seeking equality. The vast majority of political [[power]] sits in the hands of just a few thousand people around the world.
You: It's a privilege to live in a safe area.
Stranger: it is indeed. i don't have a personal opinion either because i never looked into the details of it but that seems to be the case with a lot of people here
Stranger: they are happy the crime rate is so low and they don't really want to change anything.
You: I make a vital distinction between what is moral and what is political. There may be societies which have low crime rates while still being highly immoral in the end.
You: Part of the problem for the US is that we have such a double standard, a legal system to be manipulated by the wealthy and a "justice" system for the poor.
Stranger: i see
Technical error: Lost contact with server, and couldn't reach it after 3 tries. Sorry. :( Omegle understands if you hate it now, but Omegle still loves you.

Curious person. This one is wrestling about a crucial topic. Unfortunately, they're looking in the wrong place. They seek a description, not a prescription. Without desert, they are trapped in a nihilistic egoism. The connection problems were surprisingly bad. Could easily be my end. =/.

You both like Web.

Stranger: Hii
You: What brings you here today, eh?
Stranger: Nothing really
You: I hear that.
Stranger: Just killing time
Stranger: How about u?
You: I am here to speak with people, to come to understand and [[Find The Other]].
You: We both have "web" tagged. What do you like about the web?
Stranger: Ohh I putted "web" because I'm currently studying how to make website
You: Oh shit. That's cool.
You: How are you doing it?
Stranger: So far so good
You: (I don't know much, sadly...been a long, long time since I really tried my hand at html...well before CSS and modern javascript existed).
You: What's your website about?
Stranger: It's a little bit confusing at first but yeah enjoying it
Stranger: Ohh that's cool
Stranger: What do you do?
You: Ironically, I work on my website with a passion, but not much as a designer.
You: That is how I spend most of my time.
You: https://philosopher.life/
Stranger: I'm not good at designing
You: It's hard to do.
Stranger: Will definitely check that later
Stranger: I gotta go man
You: Peace.
Stranger: It's nice talking to you
You: Feel free to reach out to me again later.
You: I have my [[Contact]] details up.
Stranger: See yah.
Stranger: Sure sure
You: `/wave`
Stranger has disconnected.

I take it that I am not worth killing time with. :P. I understand. I admire politeness.

You both like Philosophy, and Psychology.
You: Hello!
Stranger: Hi
You: What brings you here today?
Stranger: Idk man. Just bored
You: I see. Yeah. That makes sense.
Stranger: You?
You: Common answer, I think.
You: To [[Find The Other]], to understand people. I like that I have the chance to speak with people [[anonymous]]ly.
Stranger: I see
You: So, what parts of philosophy and psychology interest you?
You: They are fantastic subjects.
Stranger: Metaphysics
Stranger: Philosophy of religion
You: Dope.
You: What parts of those interest you?
You: Do you consider yourself a religious person?
Stranger: God's existence, nature, and relation to tbe world. No
You: Are you interested in metaphysics primarily as it pertains to philosophy of religion?
Stranger: Yes
You: Oh, cool.
Stranger: What about you?
You: Who have been reading?
You: I am quite interested those topics, and others as well.
Stranger: I'm currently reading the history of cosmological arguments
You: Oh. Hell yeah.
You: This is me, btw: https://philosopher.life/.
Stranger: Cool
You: It's interesting to see someone who isn't religious walking through the subject carefully.
Stranger: Lol I guess
Stranger: Are you religious?
You: Yes.
You: I believe in [[The Good]].
Stranger: Are you a Platonist
You: I am. A [[Straussian]] Platonist. I take [[Saint Plato]] seriously, though I cannot say I understand enough.
Stranger: Interesting
You: What brought you to reading about philosophy of religion? Did you grow up around people who held religious views?
Stranger: I grew up Catholic. Wasn't really religious growing up
You: I've been having some trouble with Omegle today, btw. I'm hoping we don't get disconnected.
Stranger: Do you have discord
You: I recently deleted it, [[Links: Discord Servers]]. I use Tox and Session as my IMing tools. https://philosopher.life/#Contact%20h0p3
Stranger: I see
You: I admire much about Discord, but I cannot justify it.
Stranger: Why not
You: I do not care for how it is designed. I think it serves the interests of capitalists, enables surveillance, fails to encourage the distribution of political [[power]] and ensuring the users own the means of production.
You: It's well-designed in terms of UX.
You: And, parts of what Discord does haven't been duplicated by any other tools. I think their noise cancellation (they pay a contractor for the rights) is excellent. I've found no great replacement.
Stranger: Btw
Stranger: To [[Find The Other]], to understand people. I like that I have the chance to speak with people [[anonymous]]ly.
Stranger: Wdym by that
Stranger: Are you a hyper sophisticated robot lol
You: Those are [[link]]s in my wiki. https://philosopher.life/#Find%20The%20Others:%5B%5BFind%20The%20Others%5D%5D%20Anonymous
You: I am regularly accused of being an advanced AI. XD.
You: And, I have some interest in [[ML|Aispondence]].
Stranger: What are you then?
You: I am not a bot though. I am happy to prove it.
Stranger: A nano machine?
Stranger: Prove it
You: I am a human, though I do think am some sort of mechanism, by and large.
You: Well, what do you think consists in a fair turing test?
Stranger: Idk
You: Hrm. Well, it's problematic for me to pick out the test entirely, right?
You: Some practice with the state-of-the-art GPT-3/J tooling might give you some experience in knowing how you want to draw those lines.
Stranger: I mean no offense but have you been diagnosed with autism?
You: That is astute of you. Yes. I am autistic.
Stranger: I see
Stranger: So what got you interested in philosophy?
You: Hrm. That's a good question. I was interested in it before I knew it had a name. My donors are both pastors. We grew up thinking about theology quite a bit. That was probably one of the keys to opening the door for me.
You: It was normal to have a conversation at the dinner table that fell within the scope of what most people call philosophy.
You: What would your parents say to your study of philosophy?
Stranger: Idk
You: Also, this is something: https://philosopher.life/#%40%3A%20FTO%20Proofs
You: I'm kinda a linkslut. You don't happen to have any links worth checking out for me, do ya? Could be about anything.
Stranger: Ok
Stranger: None
Stranger has disconnected.

They have so little to say. I wonder what they wanted to talk about, or, I suppose, I wonder what they would have found interesting.
