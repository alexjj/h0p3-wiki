Woke at 4. God damn, I slept so fucking hard. 2021 is the Year of Best Sleep. Meditation, then Rumination+Fireman Time! 

Bugged her. She was in a good mood despite not sleeping enough. She's made her B̶o̸t̷t̵l̴e̴ ̴o̴f̸ ̶w̷a̶t̸e̶r̵ lemonade. We got in trouble: woke my daughter up, being too loud. Muffalettas and mandarins, then two kinds of dark chocolate + tea, [[TTTOTW]]. Oh, and someone compared my work to Principia, jokingly, perhaps.<<ref "w">> They've made it difficult to reach them, and I'm going to leave it there. They can find it if they really want to.

Match with my daughter. Held hands and talked. It was a good day.

[[TTTOTW]]. Feeling the grind. I know so few actually give a fuck about it, but I've earned the right to set it aside. I'm glad I have those who do at all (quite an honor), and I continue in the desert. Maybe my words will reach those who might need them after I die too.

Talked with [[JRE]]. Feeling pressure as [[Rb]] is already closing up shop in anticipation. Advised me on the roof and the room. 

Match with my son. Experience is coming into play. There's less variance when we draft the entire cube, understandably. I've been making a lot of mistakes and my memory has been poor. Both my offspring are sensing it. I've been doing a shit job of writing lists down. Here it is:

I adore how my daughter is quite consistent in pointing out that she cannot trust any of my words about the [[FO]] game while we are playing the game. All such words are spoken toward victory.

[[TTTOTW]].

[[The Den of Thieves]], thinkin' with my son. {[[Dream]]}ing. We made a poster with [[Zing]], `tags: `, and "Quote of the ~~day~~ Dream of The Room," may it be {{Text Art: 𝕱𝕴𝕽𝕰🔥}}. [[5c0ut]]<<ref "n">> and I thought some together, then my son and I worked on the tooling a bit. It's a first attempt. Just the boys sittin' there.

A massage. I'm like officially now a beginner at this art. It's cool. Storm hit and her head a'sploded, her spinal-system tensed. Who doesn't want to touch a hawt naked woman's body? I am quite happy to be the creepy perv.

Let the record show that (a) "perfect as always, [[k0sh3k]]" and (b) "oof" as the manboy turns bright red like dat dress. I guarantee you that almost every most man you've worked with has thought about it (they have to work not to stare :P), and I bet most have masturbated to you. Tribute cums. They want to wear you like a pair of sunglasses: one leg over each ear.

[[Family Gathering]]. [[5c0ut]] made an amazing curry with pickled veggies, naan, and I had water too. It was crazy awesome. We lingered at the table, unlike our usual savage selves who shovel it in and go. It was dope.

Fuck...I don't remember what happened after that. My brain is giving up. I'm giving up on you too, brain.
