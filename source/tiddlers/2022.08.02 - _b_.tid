One doesn't recognize and take ownership of bad actions without trying to fix the damage and prevent it from happening again, and barring the possibility of that, working toward making amends otherwise. Of course, there are limits to what we should claim ownership of as well, especially when faced with external contradictions and the problems associated with the concept of corporate responsibility.

Is US colonial monetary policy a type of rent-seeking? Perhaps one insane version or branch of the goal of the US government (wielded by capitalists around the world) as a transnational corporation in the "market" of the ego-pyramid's war of all-against-all is to get paid to print money. That's one way to take more than you give, to centralize power. I'm not claiming the USG will be successful in that endeavor, at least not long-term. A different kind of usury arises out of oscillating toward negative interest rates either through asymmetric inflation (where the US gubmint's favored contexts proportionately suffer less than others in a war of attrition that forgetful minds shocked into focusing on present material conditions are unlikely to grasp in sufficient numbers in time to revolt against) or negative yield treasuries, crediting or paying for the right to hold USD in the currency that the principal can print at-will. Destroying "blackmarkets" (defined by regulatory capture and enforced through imperialism) that would otherwise arise is, of course, what free markets do when competing positivist governments cannot be distinguished from mere corporations. Capitalism and free markets are desire signaling centralizers: they generate [[power]] oligopolies and monopolies by their very structure; and we need signal-mixing, translating, and tallying computers that consistently redistribute that power (including, unfortunately, the will of a people that doesn't reduce down to mere individualistic egoism), compound jubilees and samaritanism to avoid crucifixions. I'll agree that the solution must be a globalist one, and it can be sufficiently decentralized (even if we never achieve certainty, we can arrive at justified stability) for those with moral intentions to safely and quickly distribute, weave, compute, and leverage their signals together.

Temp ban chains, where anyone can ban another with a reason posted for why which enables others to ban the original banner, seems pretty cheap. Should it Othello flip the bans? Proof-of-social-work to generate accounts that leverage the trust earned by longerstanding users, the highly distributable federation that prevents the sybil attack while combing through for authentic users may still split the network(s). Automatically generating perspectives of the clusters of shards to hop may be federation, but I'm not sure how to incentivize the sharing of the reduction of private signal graphs of a cluster nor how to do so safely enough.

We are morally obligated to make [[good]] [[faith]] efforts to [[share]] some language in common, universally, and, of course, this cannot be done without particularization and contextualism rungs on that non-pointless* ladder.

One of my favorite parts of //Ender's Game// command school simulators is how the UIs as DAGs of any number of perspectives and scopes could be instantly assumed, perceived, played with, used, etc. That is what my net browser should strive for.

It seems that if [[TOP]] social voice credits were the fiat currency of the market, it would prevent the corruptive, blackmarket buying of "standard political" credits with "standard money." Enforcing the monopoly, authority, and a dictatorship of the distributed computer of the proletariat is the only option to defeat the golem (and, of course, the odds are slim that we will cooperate in [[good]] [[faith]] long-term even then -- but, [[Justice]] is blind to the knowledge of our actual material conditions). Accept political economies as inescapable, and entertain the idea that even ideal systems shouldn't try to peel apart economics from politics like spherical chickens in a vacuum.
