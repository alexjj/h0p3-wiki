How's life going?

Hey [[h0p3]]. I think I did a good thing?
Ima call you tonight to catch up :)
Apr 20 1:41pm
Cool! TTYL! =)

How are you doing? What did you get up to this past week?

Hey [[h0p3]]!
We attended a virtual birthday party for a friend's 3 year old on Saturday.

Yesterday, Selah taught me a new card game and we took a walk. 

We're looking for a larger apartment so we walked through the particularly co-op friendly part of the neighborhood.

Lots of no-owner housing options, community gardens, even the hq for the local Marxist party (which I mention for your interest ;)). They even have a badass playground called le parc des joyeux vikings with several tiers of rope nets and a tall metal tube slide, all nautical themed.

Yo!

I hope the birthday party went well. Were you all able to play any virtual games for the party (seem to be cropping up more)?
Apr 27 9:45pm
What card game?
Apr 27 9:46pm
Walks have been rockin' my world, soakin' it in. You guys gettin' stircrazy a bit?
Apr 27 9:48pm
I hope you find an apartment that suits ya. Sounds like you have excellent options. That park is gorgeous. Perfect for little ones too.

Selah and I played spite and malice. I experienced SIGNIFICANT highs and lows over the course of that one game. I think we both learned something about myself that game...

We're not particularly stir crazy. Walks are just a good idea, I think, regardless of whether or not we feel desperate for one. It's like, by the time you're feeling thirsty, you're probably already dehydrated and should have drunk something hours ago.

Thank you for wishing us a space. Although we have our preferences, we pray God will place us where we will be useful.

How are you (all) doing? I see you saw Captain Fantastic. It's been a few years, but that was a memorable movie for me.

Games are fascinating devices. What'd did you both learn about yourself that game?
Apr 29 6:16am
Totally appreciate the hydrate before you diedrate metaphor. I've been feeling the need to walk more than usual these past few months. The dial has turned up.
Apr 29 6:17am
Not easy to find a place to be useful. We're already having to look since it's possible we'd be required to move here in 8 months.
Apr 29 6:25am
What kinds of commute times will each of you have, ya think?
Apr 29 6:26am

We're doing well enough. Everyone's pretty worried, the adults more anxious and the youth more depressed (something like that); homelife has been good though.
Apr 29 6:27am
Captain Fantastic caught me off guard. My brother [[JRE]] picks out movies for me with absurd consistency (weep in most of them).
Apr 29 6:29am
We all had strong but different reactions to it. My wife has visceral reaction to it, not liking the movie in the a similar way to how she doesn't like //The Giving Tree//. My offspring see themselves in the kids, and they made us pause the movie many times to laugh or point something out. We've been digesting it.
Apr 29 6:31am
We learned that I feel BIG stupid emotions :P

I had a moment when I had her on the ropes and I laughed, sincerely, like an evil maniac (sympathy for twirly moustache villains and campy cartoon bad guys everywhere). Like I couldn't even help myself. 

Then, my plan fell through because I didn't realize the joker I was holding was actually a substitute three of spades from Selah's deck. My one game-winning move  foiled. 

When I was spectacularly destroyed at the end of that game, I was a ruined, quivering mess for close to an hour, but then we had intimate time and I felt better.

Lol. That's awesome. I bet you are extremely fun to play with when you get into a game. It's amazing what cardboard can do for story telling. Best way to end a game too. Those are good memories.
