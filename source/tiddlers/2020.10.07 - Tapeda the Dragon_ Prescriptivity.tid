title: 2020.10.07 - Tapeda the Dragon: Prescriptivity

"""
[05:08:10] h0p3: Sir Bach has not given me a reason to think he has a strong conception of moral philosophy. I appreciate his claim. He's a brilliant person. I'm going to ask you to be extremely thoughtful about prescribing to me.
[05:10:07] h0p3: You still have not revealed your hand here, and I'm not asking you to. Take all the time you need. 
[05:13:12] h0p3: Sir [[kickscondor]] is not someone I can interpret effectively enough either. He is a hoot. I'm lucky to have met him.
[05:15:17] h0p3: I agree that ML could perhaps provide tools to assist us in understanding and applying The Telos and The Golden Rule. I am not optimistic that it will be used wisely. 
[05:19:26] h0p3: I do not know the answer to your reward systems question. I have been much closer to death than most humans, and I will not agree that it is a place where one realizes life is worth living in all cases (but, some, yes, definitely). I do not think most people really care if their lives are for a great good, not even the people I've met on their deathbeds. I've met a lot of people facing death as a pastor's kid, and most never make it over the existential hump. I am fortunate enough to meet some (about 3% of those above 25) who seem to have it right (though, obviously, few are generally articulate about the matter). 
[05:22:34] h0p3: I appreciate your analysis of why many people write to me. There is a lot to read there (books and books worth). I would be interested in knowing what you think of my relationships. If and when I have time, I aim to [[Footnote]] them considerably. 
[05:25:39] h0p3: Your minglin' claim has sat with me for a while. You do occupy a special space. I am often much quicker and stingier in how I engage in dialogue with others. You come loosy-goosey, fluid, exploratory, and open, and I'm trying to let you mingle and flow in between. I think my perspective is more crystallized, hardened ([[WINTCIS]]), less plastic, and so forth. I [[hope]] take what is worthy to help you on your quest.
[05:26:24] h0p3: Resonance is a word that continues to pop up for me. I'll agree that I'm not terribly convincing in a lot of contexts, especially not given the amount of work I put in. 
[05:27:20] h0p3: There is a moral question in rhetoric that must be answered carefully.
[05:29:56] h0p3: I have worked to make peace with the fact that people are primarily going to hate me and what I have to say. I am lucky to have a few who listen regardless, who [[love]] and [[like]] me even if they hate much of what I have to say. I'm not telling the story that people desire to hear, but I rarely think their desires are justified (despite the fact that I aim for a political apparatus that attempts to represent their desires). I am a madman in the desert.
[05:31:01] h0p3: You and my wife seem to share a lot of shows in common.
[05:32:54] h0p3: I appreciate your recommendation for learning an instrument. I have played [[Music]] some. I will likely play some again. If I were to really learn a new instrument, I think I'd want to learn to make electronic music (but, I'm not convinced it's a wise use of my time...maybe when I'm older and I'm satisfied with my attempt).
[05:35:32] h0p3: [[Music]] has been an important anchor and example for me in life. It's part of why I don't trust my affect pretty often. It's a delicious drug though. Sometimes it's a reason to stay.
[05:44:10] h0p3: I much prefer text to voice/video while studying, btw. I realize that is often impossible. Do you have any particular videos from TheoriaApophasis you want me to think about?
[05:54:33] h0p3: I try to listen to those who others deem crazy. Many contradictions are revealed this way. 
[05:56:15] h0p3: I think there's something to be said for being able to wander and digest another's word salad. I can see why a TheoriaApophasis is punished. I obviously have a lot in common with this person. 
[05:58:22] h0p3: I aim to be hedged-conservative (not [[pright]]) in how I approach what I deserve, [[WINTCIS]]. My gut instinct about my gut instinct is that I can't trust myself not to be selfish. 
[06:11:30] h0p3: I may be misunderstanding you (I think I do often). I suggest a non-trivial percentage of English speakers would benefit (though I do not claim hedonically) as functioning moral agents from taking me seriously, even for a few hours. Do I think I deserve to be heard? To some extent, yes. I think my gardens will have to grow organically. I am attempting to play a long-game here (though perhaps I do not have enough time to do so). There is a chance many might see it (and, I think ML on my wiki is an extra-long game). Perhaps there will come a time where I will be much louder.
[06:13:07] h0p3: I appreciate that we get to practice with each other too! That is crucial. Part of my job is to train up wrestlers, and I'm lucky to play and practice.
[06:18:38] Tapeda: Laptop: hm, well if i can ask a quick quite personal question about me encrypted and that: What would you reccomend in the way of cards to play when walking into the public lectures here in greenland, something that says "Hi i'm a highschool dropout, and previously middle school dropout, that doesn't want to get a job as the local cashier, so if there's anything i can do to help, holla at me" i realize this is far left field, however I am trying to sneak in to academia somehow as the scouring of knowledge alone does get quite tiredsome without application, and in the vain of the crazed john mcafee who has a great quote "either you take hard drugs before 25, and you're a leader, or after 25 and you're a follower" hahaha
[06:24:42] h0p3: > i take your literal commentary very serious as i wish to never be free from it, as the moment 
ones reputation exceeds your intuitions it seems impossible to get any honest commitment in commentary back

I ask for clarification on this one. Hold no punches back, please. I hope to be extremely deliberate in my commentary, [[WINTCIS]].
[06:27:40] h0p3: “Writing long books is [often] a laborious and impoverishing act of foolishness: [particularly when] expanding in five hundred pages an idea that could be perfectly explained in a few minutes. [In many cases, a] better procedure is to pretend that those books already exist and to offer a summary, a commentary.”

― Jorge Luis Borges
[06:32:57] Tapeda: Laptop: I've guess I've personally experienced a certain wall I hit with many I attempt to prace with, in where they at some point stop providing me with commentary and begin to experience something akin (but no where near as great ofc) as Voevodksy.. "Mathematical arguments had gotten so complicated, he realized, that other mathematicians rarely checked them in detail. And his stellar reputation only made the problem worse: Everyone assumed that his proofs must be right."
[06:33:07] Tapeda: Laptop: I guess*
[06:34:10] Tapeda: Laptop: heh and perhaps you're right on borges there as i found your verbosity to be one of the most useful, and likeable aspects of your wiki
[06:35:02] h0p3: It depends on what you mean by sneaking into academia. If you want a job as an instructor or professor, you won't escape the credential requirements (it's the cheapest signaling mechanism). If your goal is to participate in academia without necessarily getting paid, then writing papers for journals is doable (though, some may hold a lack of credentials against you; so you may have to shop around more).
[06:35:54] h0p3: McAfee is such a special dude, lol. I think he's kinda baller.
[06:36:34] Tapeda: Laptop: He definetely seems more self-aware than he has any right to be with the `shit` he's ingested
[06:45:15] h0p3: That wall is sad enough to be hilarious. I hate to say it, but most academics I've met simply aren't interested in speaking with you unless they have reason to believe it will price-efficiently improve their status. 
[06:47:48] h0p3: I can appreciate the need for that dialectical friction, sounding boards, and digesting with [[the other]]. 
[06:50:20] Tapeda: Laptop: well to talk more of what i request to be encrypted; I've already met with many of the professors up here, and there's a beautiful communal thing in greenlandic culture you may be missing, there is a patience in every interaction here that leaves a very strong impression on one, there is no such thing as saying quick, or saying the right 4 things that kiss their ass the right way, it is what i find so profoundly great of living here(lived around many european places before this), it is the great human conversation, but everyone's interested, no one shy's away (not too far to run perhaps).
[06:58:01] h0p3: That is dope. My hypothesis is that colder climates tend to select for humans, virtues, and cultures that are more likely to enable people to thrive together in close quarter (and plan for it too). When fruit falls off trees year round and shelter requirements are minimal, it gives rise to different communities. I'm an envious. I'm glad to hear that people are listening carefully to you.
[07:00:57] Tapeda: Laptop: Yes, the virus has for sure also opened many-a-doors for what people deem far-fetched or out there and wild, and i definetely have a similar hypothesis in where people cuddle up in the cold and want nothing more than to get away from sticky icky people in the warmth lmao
[07:01:35] Tapeda: Laptop: anyway I'll ttyl! It's always a pleasure
[07:01:58] h0p3: Yup. Peace.
