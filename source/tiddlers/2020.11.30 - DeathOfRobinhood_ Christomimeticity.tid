Dear DeathOfRobinhood,

I'm looking through what I've written, and I think you already know everything I'm thinking. Lol. Welp, I'm glad you don't mind my redundancy, wild opinions, and grandiose gibberish.<<ref "g">> It's what I got.

Old Red has some muscle to it. Resilio Sync is great for syncing TW across devices (including your phone). My brothers had laptops for TW, and (semi-alternatively) a laptop is well-suited for being fully encrypted (I'm not convinced that will matter for you). 

I grin every time you call yourself a narcissist. You must be the only person who sees that in you; that might be what the test really shows in this case. It's what you fear (and surely you will paranoically doubt I'm wrong here too), but it's not who you are. You have a high standard, and rightfully so: you are a skilled wrestler. Ego is often the enemy, though itâ€™s also part of the engine and non-trivial product.

What characters would you prefer to have seen on your list? What would your list have been without consulting the psychometric oracle? I think of you as a quiet (though articulate and fittingly sensitive) leader. That doesn't make for the best hollywood experience. There's probably something wrong with the list too.

Your tentative question is something I can't take lightly (though I am honored that you would introduce it with humor; I think that might be one of my [[love]] languages,<<ref "a">> and you speak it fluently). I take us to be attempting to [[fff]]ingly understand (and, unfortunately, that includes the infeasible seeming task of trying to //describe//) the meaning of Christ, and I am never qualified or justified enough. It's gotta be done though. Aint no way around it, sir.

[[Questioning|Question Everything]] and seeing every character (fictional or otherwise) in virtue of Christ (the embodiment of The Golden Rule, and, thus, at the very least a part of The Good [and, I am not qualified to say more]) is a crucial method. All fall short, and all finite stories become incoherent and incomplete after sufficient scrutiny. You pick out a blindingly bright light (perhaps it is better to look at the reflections<<ref "r">> than straight at it sometimes); everyone is a secondary character on that path ([[Good]]!). That said, to my eyes, some identities disintegrate or disappear more than others when looking through that lens. Some seem to maintain their integrity and purpose though. I am often wrong about whether or not a protagonist is really a hero, the character of most importance^^tm^^ ([[gfwiwcgws]]), a tool that merely drives the plot forward, the creature-canvas that changes the most, or the person with the most to lose. If we're not looking to interpret the world and ourselves through what is sacred and divine (I recognize many [[infinigress]]ive problematics here, and I don't know how to solve them satisfactorily [I never do, lol]), we're doing it wrong. 

I would be interested to see a list selected for Christomimeticity (and not just //The Last Unicorn// levels of smacking us in the face). Unfortunately, for a similar test (and perhaps there's an appearance of hokeyness, blasphemy, or [[cult]]ishness to even attempting such a thing), it requires having enough people to agree on the mapping from the questions to the characters. It's already difficult enough to pick out characters in popular fiction (I barely know most of these characters on any of our lists...I'm lost in the flood of characters and stories. I'm lucky to locate any of us, let alone in relation to that which matters most). I am glad to have characters that pick out what I should not be, but I also need more characters that light the path for who I should be (or try to become like). The test as it is didn't inspire me to go find out more about these characters beyond the surface (maybe I should though).

I have wept many times through //Rick and Morty// S02E10's<<ref "d">> final moments.<<ref "s">> NIN's hymn, //Hurt//, alone will do that to me. Perhaps that is not fitting. I do not claim it is rational enough (that I would even care about these stabbing characters and all too human story so much, especially in the ways that I do, is probably a demonstration of that<<ref "k">>). Like Rick, the show is tainted in many ways. I wish that show's telling had begun with [[the end]] in mind, but it's obvious it did not (and that is why it is an exceptionally incoherent story [at best], and I hope not by design). The story will only ever be an entertaining shadow of what it could have been. It is fair to say I ask too much of Harmon as an overly entitled consumer.<<ref "h">> He is wrestling on the screen for us. Even if he doesn't begin the right way, and even if he doesn't intend to do what's right, I am lucky to watch him wrestle.

You will be the first person I've met whose digitized self-modeling begins with an atomized foundation of holy text. I think most of us are simply trying to reveal our inner lives seemingly (and futilely) ex nihilo, but, I would argue, you aim to explicitly reveal and build it in virtue of more timeless material and tentpegs up front.<<ref "f">> Perhaps like writing it in blood, some might think it sacrilegious to begin writing one's life at the back of a Bible (or in it, or on it, or with it, and not merely alongside it). I think it makes good sense to begin with such a book on your bookshelf. May your work be an appendix, a branching garden, a revealed example, and a bright footnote to what matters most.

Love,

h0p3

<<footnotes "d" "This show is one of my lullabies to quiet my mind so I can sleep. I do not fall asleep to this one so well though. For lack of better terms, The Non-Escape Escape, maybe even Harmon's Slip, of S0301 is far more comforting to me (the episode of this show I've conveniently fallen asleep to the most).">>

<<footnotes "s" "More than just tears the first couple times: I cry ugly. That is one of the most overt references in the show (and, to be clear, I am the sort of person who misses the obvious all the time, and I [[hope]] you will take me seriously when I claim ineptitude...there's extra wrongthink in my brain that an non-autist and a more well-read person would never have). Depending on how we wish to speak of Christomimetics (we are way outside of what I understand), I suggest (vastly) broken images of Christ bleed through Rick in many places. I appreciate that it is an expensive subject to draw comparisons to or from at all. Sometimes, representation is all that I have, even just to experience other representations.">>

<<footnotes "f" "I think the analogy is almost contradictory here. There is an uncovering with the creation of a covering.">>
