title: 2021.02.08 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Bleh 2 Insane

//Cozy snowed-in day. Enjoyed the coolth of the home.//

$:/plugins/telmiger/EditButtons is wonderfully lazy for fixing part of the timestamp problem.

Rejected, I think `/wave`. I understand. I need to shave. I can look younger, and apparently, I need to care right now. Need to get fucking RIPPED, my ninja. Ultimately, however, the [[ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱]] will be the deciding factor and filtering mechanism (maybe destroy all chances).

Bunch of accounts on networks I abhor beyond all compare (I feel tainted). Terrible devil, middleppl. Insta is completely fucking blocking me by IP (and suspected proxies - my IP addresses are always dirty because of Tor and i2p support), secondary phone number, protonmail, lmao; surprisingly hard to make a clean account (my wife has offered to generate one for me on her networks <3). The boxes I'm supposed to fit into deny basic autonomy; they are built for something else. I know what these places are. Access requires dishonesty in a sense (heads up: ~~Rusty Shackleford~~ Tyler Price ^^such a badboi, roflmao^^ is not my name). I'm leaving a trail here, and if anyone cares for me, great. If not, I've not burned too much energy. My first task is to get us off these horrifying networks immediately (and, in a sense, I think this may doom my process as well). I have no idea how to make a worthy profile anyway:

<<<
ENM, Talkative, Obsessive, Extremely Neurodivergent

https://philosopher.life/ (A computer is highly recommended)

h0p3@protonmail.com

I strongly prefer secure messaging tools, even for casual conversations.

It's fair to say I'm nervous. I'm trying to find offline relationships, and, unfortunately, it requires meshing with my online identity (a tall task).

Pretty sure I won't find any ~~cool kids~~ retards like me on these networks (and, it's gonna be difficult finding anyone who is willing to install a piece of software just for me, though I do it for others). Gotta try though (do you like dogs? GTFO here, NOW!). Apparently, on a few of these tools, I've recieved likes/swipes, but I'm not paying to find out (I literally don't believe it; bots, almost guaranteed). Talking with my son at lunch about it. Thinking with him about the fact that he's probably gonna have to hunt like this too. It is degrading.

Nagged everyone, as I do. Nobody is missing their iron and D. `/salute`. Gracias. My breath is still smelling bad, like onions. It's that cheese. :P. Pretty sure a dragontard needs dragonbreath. Apparently, I'm here to LARP, according to the interwebs.

VPNCloud discussion, encouraging the dev, donation even. A Snap is a good idea muhfuckah! (I'm worried given how OS-specific virtual nics have to be that this is just not reasonable though). Still one of the leetest practical "immediate replacement" tools in town. I wish I could select devs and projects that deserved money. It's no yggdrasil, but this one does (perhaps with fitting stipulations).

[[ASmith]]'s crew is thinking about the right sorts of problems. We all have our own stupidity. There are so few venues where I get to make an ask on these topics. Paranoid family, that's what he's cultivated. They really do love each other.

Busted out the table and gave my wife a real massage (well, with what little skill I have). She's become far more sensitive over the years. She used to beg me to go even harder (in this arena), but now she's almost ticklish when I press too hard, and I find a new line with her. She seemed much better. Kept her warm too. And, yes, I want the baby oil off your skin on my fresh, fuzzy blanket. Live for it. I know what I want, woman. Give it to me. Smother me.

Demandy-request that she remote today (because I don't fucking trust New Haven's streets after this snow, though I'm not bothered by the student's murder as much), and it went aight. S and SI quasi-telepathically knew exactly what was happening too, and they played along as well (not everyone gets it, but these two have a real understanding of their papertrails). I wish I were as cool as these females; they fucking get it. Best co-workers ever, imho. I'm so mindblind by comparison (I'm also not nearly as charitable in my interpretations).

Offspring seemed more on task (my son is tired though), but after last night, they should be. Come to Jesus moments and so forth. They never end. I'm glad my wife is recognizing the limits of our [[power]] here. End of the day, they still didn't have it done though. 1.5 hours of real work, failure. They did, however, shovel snow and do some chores.

For fun (because apparently, he //likes// to cook, and this was despite my protest that it's my job to cook and he should chill), my brother spent all day making an Indian meal (after hitting up one of his many student chefs [my offspring are gravely mistaken for not learning from this patient teacher], who is born and bred Indian and knows what it do, for recipe checks [then doing his own thing on top of that to taste {I can boil water...}]), and it was insane. [[Family Gathering]] was us ogling this food, like we were in a restaurant. It was the best butter chicken I've ever had (I didn't think the ingredients we had in the house could do that). We [[grateful]]ly had to wait to have sex because we were too full.

Fucking. Used and abused. I like making her work for it, where she can barely catch her breath. Cum to Jesus moment and so on. I have waited too long. I've had 5 other orgasms in the past 24 hours, but nothing compares (and I'm fucking good at getting myself off [which doesn't mean I'm good at having sex at all], if I do say so myself [and, I do]). Relief, eyes watering. My hands shook for 15 minutes afterward, then showered with her. 

Got lots of reading done today (some garbage intake too), though nothing is standing out. Lost, as usual, like a dumbfuck. 

Cleaning up [[Recent Obsessions]]. I have failed, tremendously. I apologize.

Thinking my shoes might be cutting circulation off some. 

My brother's infectious laugh can be heard throughout the house. He adds such a bright color to our rainbow. We have all laughed a lot more than usual. He's like an amplifier.

Xonsh is still fucked, some Redhatters on it (thank god). VBox hax to get Android 9 x86 up (a pile of shit still, and I no have idea why it's not amazing). Session continues to grow; more active than many of the competitors in live use (missing a lot of important features still, but network effect seems even more important). 

Need to do taxes here soon enough. Think I might let the offspring run through it this time. 

We're almost out of TP, yikes! Need moar shelves too. They lacked one leg in the last set, so I'll take a spare off the model. XD. Bro asked not to hit the Asian market, prefers we save money. Right on, sir.

Offered to let my daughter stay up late on the condition she was working on her machines. She said I couldn't trust her to get do so. I respect that honesty.

Wife wouldn't go to bed at a reasonable hour. Afterward, she asks, "why are you the worst?" and I instantly responded (before I could even think about it, my body just, like, knew) with an amazing fart. Demolished.
