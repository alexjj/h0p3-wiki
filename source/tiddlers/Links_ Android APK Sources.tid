//With disgust, dismay, and despair...I'm stuck in this hellhole. This space continues to evolve at too rapid a pace, and I still can't cull this list well enough (oh, you thought I was talking about urf, didntcha?). I am, however, struck by the nostalgia of direct download software hosting sites of the 90's (a similar vibe here, <3). There's little that stands the test of time in the churning sea of [[noise|S2NR]], especially the darker sections (and, ofc, to dust we all return). It's a graveyard that reminds me of the web itself, and hence all the overlap. So, user beware, ignore the [[games]], if it's too good to be true it is, find your own trusted sources and scanners, watch your permissions, remember you don't own your machine anyway, and perhaps consider lucky patcher or GNU/Linux instead.//
