How was your weekend, sir?
Jun 15 5:39pm
Hey
Jun 15 8:22pm
Yo
Jun 15 8:22pm
It was nice. It was Selah and her dad's birthday, so the family got together for a visit
Jun 15 8:22pm
Had a somewhat difficult and revelatory conversation in private with her brother's sister, which I hope will be helpful
Jun 15 8:23pm
Sunday we just crashed. I started a Tiddlywiki for bible verses by theme
Jun 15 8:24pm
Which would be my second TW project actually...
Jun 15 8:25pm
How was yours?
Jun 15 8:25pm
Sounds like you had a super busy weekend. Glad you got to crash. I hope the party was fun.
Jun 15 8:25pm
Neat. I didn't know you've been diving into TW.
Jun 15 8:26pm
Will you be atomizing a Bible such that each verse goes gets its own tiddler?
Jun 15 8:26pm
[[REDACTED]]
Jun 15 8:27pm
Mine was good. I got a date, so really good.
Jun 15 8:27pm
Haha. The thought crossed my mind
Jun 15 8:27pm
A first-rate date for my mate
Jun 15 8:27pm
Hell yeah. Saturday was dope.
Jun 15 8:28pm
Reading the wiki through google translation
Jun 15 8:29pm
How many languages have you spoken, btw?
Jun 15 8:30pm
super jelly, lol
Jun 15 8:30pm
I presented it to my colleagues as a place to put references together, but it didn't really catch on
Jun 15 8:30pm
I am not a good salesman
Jun 15 8:30pm
TW is ugly. It's not you, lol.
Jun 15 8:31pm
That web 1.0 lookin shit.
Jun 15 8:31pm
Just English and French. Ive got rudimentary Chinese and Spanish, but together they don't make up a 0.5 tongue...
Jun 15 8:31pm
Hah! I've never been one to make aesthetic sites actually. I don't know why, but they fall outside of the category of things I take pains to make pretty
Jun 15 8:32pm
Is this the beginning of the collection of scholarly art knowledge you were considering putting together?
Jun 15 8:32pm
I guess
Jun 15 8:32pm
Not art in general
Jun 15 8:32pm
Just as pertaining to animation
Jun 15 8:33pm
That is surprising to me. Maybe it's like a chef who just makes PB&Js when they get home after work. Makes sense to me.
Jun 15 8:33pm
(that's what my brother [[AIR]] often does)
Jun 15 8:34pm
JRE?
Jun 15 8:34pm
AIR
Jun 15 8:35pm
JRE = [[JRE]]
Jun 15 8:35pm
Oh!
Jun 15 8:35pm
How is [[AIR]]? You guys talking much?
Jun 15 8:35pm
If you had a preferred translation, what would it be?
Jun 15 8:35pm
I'm more comfortable in English if that's what you mean
Jun 15 8:35pm
Yeah, we're chillaxing. I don't get to talk to him as much as I'd like, but I don't want to crowd him. I'm just lucky to be able to speak with him.
Jun 15 8:35pm
My dad was French, but my mom has better English, so that's what we spoke. They could both speak Malay though
Jun 15 8:36pm
You have like .25 of Malay under your belt?
Jun 15 8:36pm
Nope
Jun 15 8:40pm
My parents didn't think it was a language with a global presence, so they didn't talk it much when I was there
Jun 15 8:40pm
That is a hard problem. Only so much time in the day.
Jun 15 8:41pm
I like how well organized you are. You seem to know what you want to get done day to day
Jun 15 8:45pm
That is high praise. I feel like I barely have control of my life, lol. It's a "wishlist" where I hope I will meet my predictions.
Jun 15 8:45pm
Offspring and I are looking at how to make that wiki for ya.
Jun 15 8:46pm
Oh gosh!
Jun 15 8:46pm
[[REDACTED]]
This is all I have minus a bit I got started on today but forgot to upload
Jun 15 8:47pm
I appreciate your (English lacks a way to signify this in plural easily, frustrating) eagerness to help :)
Jun 15 8:48pm
Yall's
Jun 15 8:48pm
That rolls off the tongue nicely actually!
Jun 15 8:49pm
It should. Southern corruptions.
Jun 15 8:50pm
Youins for some Northerners
Jun 15 8:50pm
What are you saying esti?
Jun 15 8:51pm
Lol, I have no idea what is meant by "esti" here.
Jun 15 8:52pm
KÃ©bec 'punctuation'
Jun 15 8:53pm
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_French_profanity ?
Jun 15 8:55pm
That's it
Jun 15 9:05pm
Impress your friends!
Jun 15 9:05pm
lol =)

It's a start.
Jun 16 12:05am
Oh, thank you! I'll look at it today
Jun 16 9:06am
This feels like a significant two-tat. I appreciate it :)
