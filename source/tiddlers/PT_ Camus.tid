; 1913-1960: Camus

* It is absurd that we ask for meaning for our lives in a universe without meaning and purpose
* The absurd is not in man nor in the world, but in their presence together; it is the only bond uniting them. 
* There is but one truly serious philosophical problem and that is suicide.
* The kill oneself is a capitulation; we should refuse to surrender unto the meaninglessness of the universe.
* The religious solution of positing a transcendent world of solace and meaning beyond the Absurd is philosophical suicide.
* Science and rationalism always hit walls in their explanations of the world; the world is unreasonable.
* The only authentic and valid solution to the Absurd is simply to accept it, and to continue living. ('Revolt')
* True revolt is preformed not just for the self but also in solidarity living. ('Revolt')
* Living with the absurd brings revoly (against the meaninglessness of life), freedom (from roles, goals, and values), and passion (living life to its fullest)
* An analysis of rebellion leads at least to the suspicion that, contrary to contemporary thought, a human nature does exist.
* Of all the methods of revolt, creation is the most effective; to work and create "for nothing," to know one's creation has no future, is wisdom.
* There is no sharp division between art, science, and philosophy: they all use symbol systems to perceive and understand the world, to construct worlds.
