; 1632-1704: Locke

* We should analyze our mental faculties and find out their limits; we cannot know everything.
* What we have direct experiences of are the contents of our own consciousness, ideas/perceptions caused by the world.
* The data from which we start to think should come through our senses, from the outside reality.
* When we are born the mind is like a blank slate on which experience begins to write.
* Personal identity is a matter of psychological continuity (in terms of memory).
* Science can deal with primary (objective, measurable) qualities; length, width, velocity, etc.
* Secondary (subjective) qualities are out of the reach of science: taste, smell, color, etc.
* We can only know the properties of a thing, not the material thing in itself.
* I can only know the contents of my awareness, not the thing (self) that is having those experiences.
* Possible knowledge consists entirely of transactions between the mysterious subject and object.
* Because knowledge/science starts from observation, there is always room for error.
* We must always be willing to change our beliefs in the light of changing evidence.
* It is mistaken and morally wrong for political and religious authorities to impose beliefs.
* As made by God in His own image, mankind was not a jungle beast in the state of nature.
* The social contract is made between free men because the presence of government is better.
* Sovereignty ultimately remains with the people; they retain their individual rights and freedom.
* If the government abuses people's rights, they have the moral right to overthrow it.
* One can acquire the property of something by mixing one's labour with it, but only where there is enough, and as good left in common for others.
* I can dispose of my property right as I wish; give it, sell it, etc., independently of government.
