title: 2020.06.16 - JRE: Creation

"""
[10:13 AM] [[JRE]]: If responsibility flows from parent to child and not the other way around because the parent choose to have the child, are parents not responsible for children that are the product of rape?
[10:15 AM] [[h0p3]]: Children do have responsibilities, including to their guardians. Creators have the much larger scope of responsibilities for their creations though.
[10:15 AM] [[JRE]]: Doesn't the child/parent argument closely mirror the social contract between society and the individuals in said society?  How are the individuals responsible to participate in said society if they never explicitly agreed to it
[10:15 AM] [[JRE]]: My phone didn't charge, so I had nothing to distract me when I took a shit
[10:15 AM] [[h0p3]]: Insofar as children have the rights of persons, there is a mapping of obligations of other persons onto that child. This can be in virtue of vicinity too.
[10:16 AM] [[JRE]]: I dont need a written answer just yet, just wanted to prompt this for future discussions
[10:18 AM] [[h0p3]]: The child:parent::individual:society relationship seems weak.
[10:19 AM] [[h0p3]]: There isn't the same creation:creator relationship in both so cleanly.
[10:19 AM] [[h0p3]]: There's also a radical complexity difference, almost like comparing household budgeting to national budgets.
[10:19 AM] [[h0p3]]: and economies*
[10:22 AM] [[h0p3]]: I don't see why our moral obligations as political creatures ultimately spring from what is standardly conceived of as consent, tacit/implicit or explicit.
[10:24 AM] [[h0p3]]: Just because the drowning girl in the pool next to me is not someone I've "consented" to participate in a society with (or is the product of rape) doesn't mean I have the moral right to my body, time, and energy to do whatever I want to do. My obligation to help her has nothing to do with a causal relationship that brought her to be drowning in that pool nor my consent.
[10:26 AM] [[h0p3]]: You are morally obligated to bind yourself to The Moral Law; sometimes that is for a society, and sometimes that is against (or toward another).
[10:26 AM] [[h0p3]]: The Moral Law is the only source of Categorical Normativity.
[10:34 AM] [[h0p3]]: Despite calling myself a neo-Rawlsian, I have very little sympathy for the standard social contract theories I've found.
[10:35 AM] [[JRE]]: I found the social contract explanation that justified violence and looting at the riots so useful...
[10:35 AM] [[JRE]]: Hehe
[10:42 AM] [[h0p3]]: I am not sure I understand that explanation. Let me rehearse that for a second and you can tell me if I'm on the right track. I take that claim to be: "Riots are justified when the social contract has not been honored by those in power."
[10:44 AM] [[h0p3]]: (in case this is valuable: Insofar as the Rule of Law is generated by a justified liquid democracy, I take it to be more than a social convention. There are cases in which what would otherwise be morally permissible becomes immoral in a context because of a justified rule of law.)
[10:47 AM] [[h0p3]]: One of my problems with the manner in which "social contract" as concept is applied in everyday discourse is that it is used to justify the status quo, to claim that those in power now deserve to have their power in virtue of the fact that they already have it.
[10:53 AM] [[h0p3]]: It gets more problematic too. If a law is not simply that which is legislated, but is also that which must also be interpreted and applied (wherein the meaning of that law also arises from how it is adjudicated and executed), it becomes difficult to say that the law can actually be broken by an authority. It is in their behavior that the law comes to have its meaning.
[11:00 AM] [[h0p3]]: Ultimately, all interactions between two or more people are political. Politics does not begin with some criterion of authority that obtains, but instead the need for one. Politics is concerned with fairly computing a compromise between two or more people's competing theories of [[The Good]] (including the good of themselves as individuals).
[12:34 PM] [[JRE]]: Is a parent child relationship really a created:creator relationship in the case of rape?  Wouldn't it be more a case of innocent parasite:innocent host?
[12:36 PM] [[h0p3]]: It's not. I'm fine with the claim of innocent parasite and host.
[12:37 PM] [[h0p3]]: Note, of course, that I don't think a fetus is a person.
[12:37 PM] [[h0p3]]: The metaphor breaks down there too.
[12:38 PM] [[h0p3]]: We can have obligations to a fetus, at least indirectly.
[12:39 PM] [[h0p3]]: The future like ours argument does have some force still.
[12:40 PM] [[JRE]]: Also, never heard of liquid democracy before... how is that not a concept that is more widespread??  Or am in the lucky 10,000 today?
[12:41 PM] [[h0p3]]: Capitalists have few incentives to promote education about the concept of democracy (or to enable it).
[12:41 PM] [[h0p3]]: It's also not easy to envision what representation can look like with automation.
[12:42 PM] [[JRE]]: I'm saying the child is a parasite even after birth to be clear.  If you took no part in the moral decision tree that lead to its existence, you are a host, even post birth
[12:42 PM] [[h0p3]]: You may still be obligated to the child.
[12:43 PM] [[JRE]]: True, but more so than any other person?
[12:43 PM] [[h0p3]]: No more so than any other person in your shoes, but that is trivially true of any possible context in which one is morally obligated.
[12:44 PM] [[h0p3]]: But, not everyone is in your shoes, and you can be more obligated than others depending on your circumstances.
[12:44 PM] [[JRE]]: No, I mean, do I have more of an obligation to save the drowning child that happens to share genetic traits with me than the random passerby?
[12:45 PM] [[h0p3]]: prima facie, I don't see why. We can rig cases in which that is the case, but I suggest that difference arises from other considerations.
[12:46 PM] [[h0p3]]: The issue of the parasite isn't a genetic one though. We could consent to pushing a button with a stork delivery of a randomized baby too. Someone could "rape" by pushing that button for you.
[12:46 PM] [[JRE]]: Sure
[12:46 PM] [[JRE]]: Sign you up for cat facts and an adoption
[12:46 PM] [[h0p3]]: boom
[12:47 PM] [[JRE]]: Can you send the baby back
[12:47 PM] [[h0p3]]: Maybe you are concerned with the problem of Moral Luck (https://philosopher.life/#Moral%20Luck).
[12:49 PM] [[JRE]]: If you have an understanding of diffusion of responsibility, and the negative effects it has on how effective a crowds response is, saying someone else will save the drowning child because we all are equally responsible makes you more indebted to the child because you realize the reduced chances of success if you dont act
[12:50 PM] [[h0p3]]: I do not know.
[12:50 PM] [[h0p3]]: I am not sure if we are equally responsible.
[12:50 PM] [[JRE]]:

[12:52 PM] [[h0p3]]: There is also a problem in the prediction mechanism issue. Your argument reminds me of not going down dark alleys because that will increase the chance that you will get beat up. I do not know the degree to which one is responsible for the choices of others. It's non-zero.
[12:52 PM] [[h0p3]]: Cute AF. I bet he loves that swing.
[12:54 PM] [[JRE]]: Specifically, what obligations do I have towards my creators and their creators?
[12:55 PM] [[JRE]]: And what obligations do your offspring have to you now vs 20 years from now
[12:55 PM] [[h0p3]]: We have a particularistic codification problem. I'm never going to be able to completely answer the question. We can only ever step closer to the answer in our context. I will attempt to generalize.

[12:56 PM] [[h0p3]]: First, creators have the rights of personhood.
[12:56 PM] [[JRE]]: Whoa, you can edit??
[12:56 PM] [[JRE]]: More u no
[12:57 PM] [[h0p3]]: shit is dope, yo...wish I saw it in secure messaging too with history/rollback
[12:59 PM] [[h0p3]]: Second, special circumstances arise between some creators and creation. Justified stewardship affords certain rights to coercion, for example. There's a principal-agent problem here, but even after the dust settles, some creations owe parts of their dialectical identities to their creators to some degree in various contexts (I know that is so generalized that it feels almost meaningless).
[1:00 PM] [[h0p3]]: One might attempt to argue about the right of a guardian in terms of the child's obligations to themselves.
[1:01 PM] [[h0p3]]: For example, when I tell my daughter to do her schoolwork, she owes it to herself to do it. It's good for her, and it's the right thing to do in her shoes.
[1:01 PM] [[h0p3]]: Do I have a right for her to listen to me? Yes, to some extent.
[1:02 PM] [[JRE]]: Only insofar as you are saying the right things to her
[1:02 PM] [[JRE]]: About as prescriptive as virtue ethics ever gets lol
[1:03 PM] [[h0p3]]: Correct. I will add that I am [[fff]]. Sometimes I make mistakes, and at least in some of those cases, she's still obligated to do what I say even when from a more ideal perspective it's obviously not the best option.
[1:03 PM] [[h0p3]]: But, we can say those are "right things" given my context.
[1:09 PM] [[h0p3]]: Third, there apears to be a place for gratitude, https://philosopher.life/#Gratitude. It might be considered supererogatory to be thankful to one's creators for creating you. I would caution being hedged-conservative here; I will take it to be an obligation. It is why I still have positive things to say about [[MWF]] and [[SLT]] in my wiki, though these are put into context.
[1:11 PM] [[h0p3]]: There are cases in which one ought to be glad, thankful, and perhaps even demonstrating gratitude for being alive, including in virtue of how one was born and raised.
[1:14 PM] [[h0p3]]: The 20 year gap does not affect the the first kind of obligation (though perhaps we should attempt to speak more about what consists in rights to personhood, whereas, for example, Hitler does not have a right to live as he is; we only have a right to live in some cases).
[1:16 PM] [[h0p3]]: The 20 year gap should generally have some difference arise in the second kind of obligation. It can be immoral to be patronizing and failing to respect (and aim for) the autonomy of  the other (reminds me of a conversation about a robot: https://philosopher.life/#2020.06.05%20-%20Carpe%20Tempus%20Segmentum%3A%20NyaNcat%20Memory%20Eraser).
[1:25 PM] [[h0p3]]: How much difference seem to be a contextual problem, but there are lines to draw (or at least directions to point). One can envision utopian societies in which the 50yo has achieved epistemic virtues that can't be achieved by 30yos, and eldership could be a source of authority. I do not believe that Gen X and Boomers are actually epistemically (and morally) more virtuous than Zoomers and Millennials though.
[1:27 PM] [[h0p3]]: That virtue, of course, would be in terms of having empathized with the younger generation effectively enough to model a coherent vision of [[The Good]] more effectively than the younger generation could. That is an extremely tall task though, and it requires a lot of integrity.
[1:27 PM] [[h0p3]]: Transparency and accountability even.
[1:31 PM] [[h0p3]]: The 20 year gap on the third kind of obligation might vary the most. As one's life unfurls, we may be in a better position to unpack why and how (and who made it) unfurl as it did, to question judgment, intention, planning, and so forth. Ideally, we'd know how much gratitude to have from just analyzing the timeslice (and knowing the probabilities of what would occur). In practice, as we walk down our paths, we'll come to realize that we should be more or less grateful for particulars.
[1:31 PM] [[h0p3]]: This covers the creation->creator obligation direction, and not the other way around.
[1:32 PM] [[JRE]]: Lol, after 20 years, I realize you're still a little shit
[1:33 PM] [[h0p3]]: lmao
[1:33 PM] [[JRE]]: I analyzed all that has been done for you and all that you have failed to reciprocate, my child, and I'm officially saying you suck
[1:33 PM] [[h0p3]]: haha
[1:35 PM] [[h0p3]]: To be clear, the ancient tradition of respecting one's elders, taking care of them in virtue of the fact that they raised you, probably has a reason "just so" evolution story, particularly for men, as they don't reach their peak sexual market value until about 50.
[1:36 PM] [[JRE]]: I think I peaked like 5 years ago
[1:36 PM] [[h0p3]]: There's Boomer literature that teaches that generation how to leverage their children, to see their offspring as a retirement plan, to exploit the younger generations.
[1:36 PM] [[h0p3]]: o o f
[1:36 PM] [[h0p3]]: Mine just keeps crawling up inside me. I went from 3 inches to 2.
[1:37 PM] [[JRE]]: It's always so embarrassing to see people openly talk about how someone needs to have kids, cause "who will look after you when you're old"
[1:37 PM] [[h0p3]]: That is a big yikes.
[1:38 PM] [[h0p3]]: A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in.
[1:39 PM] [[h0p3]]: Thinking about what we owe future humans is extremely expensive (and not so easy to make sure that even a liquid democracy will effectively accomplish).
[1:39 PM] [[JRE]]: trump 2020
[1:40 PM] [[h0p3]]: Every once in a while, I tell my wife that I would love to watch her bang Trump. It's so gross, almost evil, it becomes hawt to me.
[1:40 PM] [[JRE]]: liquid democracy works if you can force everyone to be philsopher kings
[1:40 PM] [[JRE]]: lol
[1:40 PM] [[h0p3]]: That's the plan, jack.
[1:41 PM] [[h0p3]]: I am going to fail.
[1:41 PM] [[JRE]]: atleast let him involve his daughter, that way Trump and your wife might be a little happier
[1:41 PM] [[h0p3]]: I would adore that.
[1:42 PM] [[JRE]]: she has such a freakishly long neck...
[1:42 PM] [[JRE]]: hey kiddos! your uncle sure is excitable! hope your schoolwork is going well, lots of love!
[1:43 PM] [[JRE]]: do they ever check in here?
[1:43 PM] [[h0p3]]: Sure. [[j3d1h]] was thinking about my claim above earlier. She shouldersurfs and receives notifications.
[1:43 PM] [[h0p3]]: Almost anything that takes her away from her schoolwork is welcome.
[1:44 PM] [[JRE]]: lol
[1:44 PM] [[j3d1h]]: i am watching and i hate this
[1:44 PM] [[JRE]]: HAHAHA
[1:44 PM] [[h0p3]]: lol
[1:44 PM] [[K]]: I've been lurking too. fun talk!
[9:22 PM] [[JRE]]: Justified stewardship affords certain rights to coercion.  Have read this sentence several times now, having a hard time understanding it
[9:23 PM] [[JRE]]: I think it's the word to...

[10:48 AM] [[h0p3]]: On less than 4 hours of sleep yesterday.
[10:54 AM] [[h0p3]]: A guardian, in some cases, has a right to engage in acts of coercion. There's an obligation to accept that coercion.
