"""
[1:53 PM] h0p3: How has your week been?

[12:56 PM] h0p3: Yo, how have you been doing? What have you been up to?
[1:13 PM] Sohalia: Hey [[h0p3]] :smile:
[1:13 PM] h0p3: You hanging in there?
[1:13 PM] Sohalia: Been chilling lately — managed to snag a few days of PTO for this week so I’m just soaking in the wonderful feeling of not having to give a fuck.
[1:14 PM] Sohalia: Definitely hanging in there
[1:34 PM] h0p3: Aye. Giving AF is so expensive.
[1:34 PM] h0p3: You having any fun with D&D?
[1:41 PM] Sohalia: When it happens, definitely
[1:42 PM] Sohalia: Dad has decided that he wants to run his own game too, but it’s a different system
[1:42 PM] Sohalia: Something about inherited fighting mechs?
[1:43 PM] h0p3: Neat. Seems like a great way to get the family together.
[1:43 PM] Sohalia: Agreed
[1:43 PM] Sohalia: And I think my dad would make an awesome GM
[1:43 PM] h0p3: Aye. All the tools and jokes.
[1:46 PM] Sohalia: He seems to know a ton about this system too — I think he said he played it a bunch back in college
[1:46 PM] h0p3: Hopefully, they'll be stories to treasure.
[1:48 PM] Sohalia: And memes galore, I’m sure
[1:48 PM] Sohalia: How are things up north?
[1:49 PM] h0p3: School has felt like a failure this week. =/. My wife is not feeling well, and I just want tonight's bookclub to be special for her.
[1:50 PM] h0p3: Everyone's safe and lost in their worlds.
[1:51 PM] h0p3: Btw, any music recommendations? I'm hunting around.
[2:00 PM] Sohalia: I will have to mull that one over — most of what I listen to today is instrumental for background buzz
[2:01 PM] Sohalia: Or fun and bubbly :eyes:
[2:03 PM] Sohalia: Been getting into Shawn Wasabi lately, more of an electro pop sound. He uses a sound board as to play his grooves and likes to throw lots of soundbites in. Pretty sure I’ve heard the sound of a pokeball opening in one of em lol
[2:06 PM] h0p3: He's clearly very talented. Reading him talk about how he manipulates his board. That's crazy.
[2:27 PM] Sohalia: There are a few videos where he focuses the camera on his board while he plays — is nuts to watch
[2:27 PM] Sohalia: Also, it’s sucks that [[k0sh3k]] isn’t feeling well. Between that and school, seems like it’s been a rough week :/
