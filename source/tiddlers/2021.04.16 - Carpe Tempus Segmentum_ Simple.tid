title: 2021.04.16 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Simple

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! I am on track to complete a [[resolution|2021 Resolutions]] (very proud, ofc). Ordered 3 more off Amazon, as this is the best I've ever found, period.<<ref "i">> [[TTTOTW]].

Saw my wife off. I could barely stay awake. Slept so hard. Thank goodness. Sat thinking in bed, not really rumination. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. 

Talked with [[JRE]]. He got the job, despite problems in the interview. Pay is damned good. [[Rb]]'s surgery was today (I misunderstood his last call), and his MIL is helping (I'm glad he asked for it; he should). I got to hear [[Q]] babble; he's cute. Talked a bit about his password manager. Liver problems and mood swings. Lots of changes.

Hugs'n'bugs. Made some quesadillas, and played a match with my son. He stacked my deck and owned up to it, so we restarted. His T2 5-mana available on the play, dropping a 4/3 Flying First Strike LLer, nasty. His threat density is too low otherwise (Bribery's next best target was Phyrexian Revoker), and he values buyback and token generation too highly (though they should be valued highly). A series of small errors allowed me to stabilize and take control of the game; it shouldn't have been mine. He didn't abuse LoA hard enough, and I could barely spend my hand in either game. Fun match.

Gave my son my pocket knife (tacticoool, ofc). The one that the donors gave him cannot be safely used (though it's pretty). 

My wife came home, and her migraine was in full swing. It's been raining all day, and the pressure is too much. Put her to bed, made her comfy. 

Assignments to my offspring, continued the standard dialecture, one day they will not need me whatsoever. I will be useless to them.

The Art Group met to engage in their activities. By the end, I decided it was best not to say anything. I knew what they thought beforehand, I know the size of that gap, and I didn't anticipate I'd be able to change their minds. The standard "what if there's no meaning to anything?" implodes on itself, and, like Cratylus, it ends the conversation. Going to stick to "that's a [[good]](-related) question." Still had fun though. Definitely some [[intimacy]] in sharing my screen, doing what I can to build bridges on that front too.
