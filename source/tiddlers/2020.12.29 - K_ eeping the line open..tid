Hope your day is good so far. ^_^ what are your plans?
Dec 29, 2020 11:54am
It's gone well enough.
Dec 29, 2020 2:40pm
Heater maintenance and putting the house together.
Dec 29, 2020 2:41pm
How about you?
Dec 29, 2020 2:41pm
Sitting at the local car shop. Had to get an oil change, walking out with new rear brakes and battery. Haha
Dec 29, 2020 2:59pm
A pretty penny but apparently it was really bad so it’s all worth it in the end!
Dec 29, 2020 2:59pm
I’m excited to see the final product— the house. :)
Dec 29, 2020 2:59pm
I hear that. I'm glad about the breaks being found and fixed. Sucks about the money though.
Dec 29, 2020 3:01pm
Aye. Anything to be safe on the road.
Dec 29, 2020 3:02pm
You guys getting some chill and play time this week?
Dec 29, 2020 3:02pm
Admittedly we needed to take it in two months ago, but better late than never and stranded.
Dec 29, 2020 3:04pm
Oh yeah!
Dec 29, 2020 3:04pm
Punching through the backlog
Dec 29, 2020 3:04pm
Thinking about getting some writing done too. 👀
Dec 29, 2020 3:04pm
2020 fucking sucked on that front but I want to work harder to make it a priority this year.
Dec 29, 2020 3:04pm
Welp, I hope your stranding is fun and productive.
Dec 29, 2020 3:09pm

❤️
Likewise! Got any big goals for 2021?
Dec 29, 2020 3:10pm
I think getting the house into shape, helping [[5c0ut]], and [[The Remodeling]].
Dec 29, 2020 3:11pm
There's lots of work to do.
Dec 29, 2020 3:11pm
How’s [[5c0ut]] doing these days? He seems to be in higher spirits than I remember from our discord interactions but I’m admittedly ignorant of his day to day and overall situation.
Dec 29, 2020 3:12pm
He's selling his things to pay off his rent, leave his roommate in good standing, and will greyhound up here soon.
Dec 29, 2020 3:13pm
He is good spirits for a person who has very little.
Dec 29, 2020 3:13pm
He has to start over again.
Dec 29, 2020 3:14pm

😢
OH. He’s moving back in with you? Or does he just need a place to stay until he figures out the rest?
Dec 29, 2020 3:14pm
I hate that for him.
Dec 29, 2020 3:14pm
It’s undoubtedly frustrating. :/
Dec 29, 2020 3:14pm
Yup. We will build out part of the house for him.
Dec 29, 2020 3:14pm

🥺
You are a champion of compassion and patience.
Dec 29, 2020 3:15pm
Also I just learned how to emote react. Unrelated but a nice feature for Signal to have.
Dec 29, 2020 3:15pm
Aye. Drawing in a bigger crowd with it, I think.
Dec 29, 2020 3:16pm

👹
Moxie (feller in charge of this here app) refuses to decentralize it. It's still one of the best tools I can find, sadly. Lol.
Dec 29, 2020 3:17pm
Aye. I saw your post about the discord break/ potential split and wanted to make sure we keep this line open. :)
Dec 29, 2020 3:18pm
Yes, sir. `/hug`. I appreciate it.
Dec 29, 2020 3:18pm

🥰
I’ve been here for almost three hours. I didn’t realize that much time had gone by.
Dec 29, 2020 3:19pm
The car shop. Sorry.
