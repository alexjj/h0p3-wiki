Dear [[Bn]],

This is year where you really started speaking in full sentences, and it was a wonderful explosion. You often did not enjoy having to sit down to learn how to talk, but people loved you and sat you down to learn. You were all patient, and positive reinforcement has been effective with you, sir. You really like being held by your mom and dad. I remain unconvinced that the speech therapy the state stopped paying for really did much at all. I think your ability to speak is a result of your parents' hard work. You've even grown a proper mouthiness, telling your dad to go away when you want to play instead. In addition to daycare (and you clearly adore your caretakers), games and books have been valuable sources of vocabulary for you.

You've had a lot of medical work done for your ear this year, sir. Your parents have been worried beyond normal about it, imho, and they've done the best that could be done for you. They are both survivors of narcissistic donors, and I am glad to see you won't have that battle in life. Your dad spent time thinking about your fears with you at the doctor, and I think it's a good thing that talking is a useful way to process the world for you.

Also, your parents have saved you some pain this year by having a slow-closing lid on the toilet;<<ref "a">> not only did that improve your sleep, but it saved your penis that you had to leave on the edge of the toilet to piss from getting hammered several times, among other things. May you, and your penis (for as long you choose to maintain one) live long and prosper.

Your father brought you to see your female biological donor one last time. he has gone out of his way to treat her fairly and with empathy. Your father forced nothing on you, but if you wanted to hug your biological donor you were allowed and encouraged.

It sounds like you've been [[wrestling]] with [[your brother|Q]] a lot this year, and he probably started it more often than you. I think you're going grow up to be a much better older brother than I was. 

Your father has been thinking about how he is going to introduce you to technology. You aren't old enough for computers, he doesn't care for having you sit in front on the T.V., but [[vidya]] [[games]] might be a place where yall [[connect]]. 

You'll be starting school soon enough, and your parents have been thinking about white flight and the costs of your education possibilities.


We gave you books with almost psychedelic imagery and a [[MTG]] deck that is dear to my heart: Titty Burn. I realize you are only 3, so we're limited at the moment. When it is suitable for you to wield these cards, may you enjoy those amazing mountains, sir.


I was fortunate enough to see you [[offline|Offline Users]] this year. It is almost certainly the case you will not remember us, but we will remember you at this fine age. You enjoyed climbing and jumping over me on the couch, played with your toys, and you and your brother have been workin' on couunting to 10 (cute). It was a joy to see you so talkative. I got to take you to your backyard to play in the water, with your soccer ball, and push you on the swings. You jump from great heights with ease, and I [[hope]] you will be able to take gymnastics. I was happy to know how you like to cannonball into your father's arms.<<ref "s">> Also, you learned how to climb over and then eventually open the baby-gates. =D. You a smart monkey, dude.



[[Love]],

[[h0p3]] or Uncle [[h0p3]], or whatever you think is fitting.

<<footnotes "s" "I've a special memory of catching you as you [[trust]]ingly lept into my arms from the tall porch too. You leap with abandon, sir. Keep that spark.">>
