title: 2020.10.11 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: A Singular Yike

* Read+Write
* Spoke with my Light today.
** I feel much further over the hump now in voice. 
** It was exactly what I needed. 
* Workin' on [[m16]]
* Fireman Time!
* Read
* Tried sleeping at 6, but probably didn't conk out until 7
* Woke at 1:30
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Bugged my wife
* Fireman Time!
* Read+Write
* [[Family Time]] @ 3:30?
* 1-on-1s
** Discussion of i2p and Tor (and the centralization problem) with son.
*** Things we've talked about several times. Seems to click better over the years. 
** Daughter found the Beaker blowup while troubleshooting her own wiki problem. 
* Reading The Wikis
** I didn't fully read mine. Was lost wandering. Lots of side discussions.
*** My daughter controlled the timers for us.
* [[JRE]] Called Us
** Glad he joined us. I think he felt bad about interrupting, but he shouldn't. He's clearly part of our family too.
** He spoke with the offspring almost exclusively. 
** We rehearse our stories with each other. It's special to watch.
* [[TTP]]s
** We had some difficulty about 8-8:30. It was not wise to debate with me there. Now they are will accountable (I will not hold my breath though).
** Still aiming for them to run.
* Reading The Wikis
** Miss having my daughter in Discord, but her choice.
* Nightwalk
** Wife didn't want to hit the trail, but we walked around the neighborhood. 
** A discussion of souls, unpredicted.

!! [[Computer Musings]]:

* After thinking about what [[ASmith]] said, I've decided to give i2pd yet another shot. 
** Confs in `/etc/i2pd/`
** It's noice. Aint the resource whore that the java client has always been. `/shakes-fist`
*** 5% CPU is acceptable, especially because the memory footprint has shrunk beautifully. Still a long way to go before you IoT on i2p well, right? Currently at least 80% bootstrapped is my guess, still drinking through a straw though (it never did abuse threading enough, but FOSS syncing on that network [and the difference in torrenting vs everything else], even by hand, would be powerful). I'm [[grateful]] to wait here too.
* `opera --proxy-server="http://127.0.0.1:4444"`
* crontab a script for `cd /home/h0p3/syncs/h0p3-wiki && python -m http.server 6969 &> /dev/null &`
* yggdrasil looks dead =/...that's the one I want to see succeed!
* Tried SSB again for the giggles.
* Nope, it appears constant updates in Beaker's Hyper blew up the drive (as I had been told). It is still not in the same league as Resilio Sync there, but I think it's amazing what can be built as is.
** Cleaned out 350GB built up in just a day on /home...
** They've done amazing work. It's ready for primetime in at least the sense that an RPi is, and that is something. 
*** I'm increasingly convinced it requires way more money to build this well. I wish I could funnel tax money into it.
** Welp, back to the drawing board.

I have an odd way of living with my broken computers, including myself. Lawd. 

Containerized, [yggdrasil (and, yes, bluetooth will be a requirement {I <3 U Briar}), i2p, hyper], in Rust, Yesterday. Will pay 1 Trillion USD. Find a Socialist's Eth, slap it in there. I still think that protocol should be from the ground up built to do that; p2p is so fucking expensive to run on what much of the world owns. May even the ravens, octopuses, and trees compute such a collective thing. 

Also, I want a Retrosharified, TWWasmified, Discordified, Aetherified, Toxified social tool built to maximize how I programmatically and by-hand pick out who I trust to moderate and curate. Feed control is a hard problem on a number of fronts. [[Hyperconversations]] not just on potatoes, but even clouds of fleas.
