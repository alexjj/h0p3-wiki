title: 2021.09.06 - Prompted Introspection: Erasing Beliefs In Falsehoods

!! If you could press a button that would instantly erase every single false belief you have, would you do it?

Obviously, I am tempted. There was a time where I'd have instantly said, "yes." Who wouldn't feel compelled to want it? The basic intuition behind the desire is something I hold in high regard. It's been an expensive journey, however, to recognize philosophy may require more of us. Hedged-conservatively, I lean toward, "no,"<<ref "s">> but I am still quite interested. Perhaps I need to know more about how this operates. You'd need to be highly specific with me about it, and, to my eyes, even knowing it was even possible to do what you said would already tell me a great deal about the nature of some of the fundamental problems in philosophy.

It's difficult to understand the implications of erasing these beliefs. Would I even really be able to grasp or wield the remaining true beliefs? It could easily dismantle (not merely disorient) the map I've got. I take myself to be working to cleanse myself of falsehoods, but perhaps it needs to be a different kind of process than pushing this button. 

Justification takes priority over veridicality. In some contexts, one can know what is false. It would be one thing if you replaced my false beliefs, but to remove them entirely may not be justified either. There are some kinds of paradoxes and categorical assumptions that a finite mind like ours must wrestle with, and perhaps in some cases, we might take up some beliefs that are false (the existence of time, for example) in some crucial manner, and perhaps it would be unjustified not to hold these beliefs. 

[[The Dialetheia]] poses another kind of problematic. It is possible that there is a sense in which all beliefs may have some types of falseness to them in virtue of it. The problem of representation in the correspondence theory may also eliminate all of my beliefs, depending on how you want to define this erasure. 

I don't feel like I've got enough information to even begin to say, "yes" to something so radical as that. I could imagine cases in which one is obligated to take those risks though, but I don't think that's where I'm at.
