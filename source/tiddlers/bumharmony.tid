Rawls believes agents behind the veil are rational, mutually disinterested utility-maximizers. We might be able to conceive of those agents as being motivated in other ways though. He's a reactionary, so this what you get if you aren't going to charitably reconstruct his argument for him.

<br>

> Why would you call a philosopher who literally calls the theory he defends or the most familiar system to him A theory of justice, a reactionary or anything at all, if he admits that with other variables we get another system? Although that relativistic outcome is as unsatisfying and untrue because no theory of property rights is better than the neoclassical ceteris paribus bogus.

<br>

Hey there bumharmony! It looks like I've struck a nerve with you. `/nod`. It is also possible you've misunderstood what I've said. I'm not sure.

I don't get the sense you've really studied Rawls more broadly. Under what circumstances am I permitted to label someone a reactionary at all? Look at his body of work at large (not just //A Theory of Justice//): he roughly aims to defend the status quo and US hegemony at an international level. He doesn't even apply his own initial theory, as a thought experiment, correctly.

As to the "most familiar system to him," we should consider Saint Kant's, upon which his work is founded, as a possibility. In essence, he's offering an interpretation of Kant (particularly a procedural interpretation of Kantian autonomy) in this theory, one that continues to play out at Harvard (an institution that has long served the interests of the wealthy, by the way).

I cannot say that Rawls took himself to be seeking a relativistic outcome, nor am I claiming good faith interpretations or reconstructions of Rawls do either. What theory of property rights are you advocating for exactly? That might help me see where you are coming from.

> For me he shows with the tools of neoclassical rational choice theory that:

> No producerist system with any inequalities can exist because wage functions don’t allow any trickle down mechanism

> No producerist system can exist at all from Kantian apriorism (not the ad hoc status quo kantian interpretation of the validity of capitalism) because that would not be rational for those who are unemployed and perhaps those with low income

> Only kantian theory that may exist is that without any property rights because property makes everyone immediately worse off

> So for me Rawls takes down every system. Capitalism and producerism can be justified only from inside. In a circular manner. Not apriori. The deconstructivist philosophy he does is part of the postmodernist standpoint theory but it leaves me thinking as a Nordic citizen that why does he not say communism is right then or atleast unbiased fixed point for improvements? Why we need to start from producerism (only those working have rights) and have the capitalistic system on the side if it does not fit producerism at all.

We may agree on quite a bit. Thank you for taking the time to speak with me. I respect your reason, [nomad](https://philosopher.life/#Find%20The%20Others). It is my honor to [wrestle](https://philosopher.life/#Wiki%20Litmus%20Test) carefully and kindly with you. 

> neoclassical rational choice theory 

That almost sounds like you're agreeing he's a reactionary, but not necessarily. Should we accuse him of begging the question? I'm fine with that. He may be correct in identifying egoism as a strong description of most human specimens, but he'd be wrong to prescribe it or deny the possibility that we could choose to be otherwise.

To my blind eyes, we're meant to see ourselves as any and every person all at once behind the [Veil of Ignorance](https://philosopher.life/#VOI). [[Justice]] is parasitic upon The Moral Law. I'm not convinced that persons themselves are the highest ends either though, and that is the fundamental metaethical question. What is The Telos, the for the sake of which, we exist? Rawls utterly fails here. He isn't sufficiently cosmopolitan, and it's arguable that he attempts to divorce justice from moral normativity.

> No producerist system with any inequalities can exist because wage functions don’t allow any trickle down mechanism

Producerism probably isn't what results from applying the thought experiment, and there are many ways to distribute [[power]], particularly in the 21st century. I would agree that justice would tend toward consistently redistributing power across the generations. Presumably, the Rawlsian "basic structures" have incredible latitude and flexibility here. He just so happens to think what we've got in the world already is more or less just (which is absurd), but a Neo-Rawlsian need not accept most of his position.

You may have a unique take on producerism. Is that the system you are advocating? Tell me more about it, please. If it will help, I deny that we own ourselves all the way down, including our labor and the products thereof, but I tend to think that is one of the primary injustices we find in the world (I have profound sympathies). Here, both Saint Marx and Locke fail to deliver the objectively correct Hohfeldian moral property rights molecules. 

> No producerist system can exist at all from Kantian apriorism (not the ad hoc status quo kantian interpretation of the validity of capitalism) because that would not be rational for those who are unemployed and perhaps those with low income

I don't think steelmanned Kantianism or Rawlsianism validates capitalism (and, I would agree probably not producerism either), though Rawls himself probably does accept that at some level. His failure need not be ours.

Note that those behind the veil are stripped of the knowledge of their employment, income, and other morally arbitrary characteristics. Further, it's far from clear that unemployment and low income would obtain in a global application of his reconstructed theory.

> Only kantian theory that may exist is that without any property rights because property makes everyone immediately worse off

Perhaps we need to make a clear distinction between moral and legal/political/juridical/positivist property rights. Kantianism clearly generates Hohfeldian moral rights to material objects, though they may be quite complex. I'm wondering if you mean to claim that all possible legal property rights make everyone immediately worse off, and presumably worse off in the long-term too. That is quite a thesis to defend.

> So for me Rawls takes down every system. 

What do you mean by "takes down" here?

>  Capitalism and producerism can be justified only from inside. In a circular manner.

That may be the case. I suggest that objective justification is external to our minds, something you won't hear a Neo-Kantian utter at Harvard. We can still work to rescue Rawls' theory from his profound mistakes though.

> The deconstructivist philosophy he does is part of the postmodernist standpoint theory but it leaves me thinking as a Nordic citizen that why does he not say communism is right then or atleast unbiased fixed point for improvements?

I agree that Rawls was likely a postmodern. It is rare that I encounter someone who agrees with me on that point. I've already pointed out that he doesn't even follow his own initial theory (and when asked about his inconsistencies at American Philosophical Association conferences, he just shrugged his shoulders and agreed he wasn't consistent). Some version of communism is the result of steelmanned, metamodern reconstruction of Rawlsian theory. I agree to your intuitions there.
