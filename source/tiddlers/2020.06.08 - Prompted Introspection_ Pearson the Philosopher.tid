title: 2020.06.08 - Prompted Introspection: Pearson the Philosopher

Oh shit, [[2019.03.19 - Prompted Introspection: Vocational Guidance]] hits me so hard still. Even now, I think about reaching out. I have reached out to many teachers I've had since I was young, but I don't feel like I'm being useful to them (and simply seeking approval for the addictive warm fuzzies isn't worthwhile). It's times like these that I wish there were such a thing as a heaven, a possible eternity in which we came as close as one might come to understanding [[The Other]]s; we would need it to even begin to unravel how [[The Infinite]] plays out in this finite material projection of a world. It is a pleasant idea.

I feel like this [[prompt]] is almost hallowed ground. It's a place I don't deserve. These are markers in my journey that scream out to me. Worse yet, I am reminded that I have probably failed to notice (and surely forgotten) too many people and events that shaped my function. It is a [[Know Thyself]] failure. I owe a great deal to a great number of people.

Dr. Eric Pearson was a transformative man in my life. He put up with an arrogant, annoying fool very well. He's such a skeptic that he let a lot fly. He was, by far, the most-well rounded philosopher at Berea. Sometimes it felt as though he didn't seem to have much of his own perspective. Instead of being a specialist, he covered so much ground with his students. He only had one way of saying something, but it was a worthy interpretation. I doubt I would be a philosopher without him
