title: 2022.01.31 - Silevence: Hey Hop3!

Hey [[Hop3|https://philosopher.life/#h0p3]]! didn't know that was you when we last spoke, that's awesome, I'm a big fan of your blog haha

>Most people don't know what to ask you, right? What should I ask you?

Whatever comes to mind, I'm an open book :D  

>*What kind of work do you do to survive? You doing design, front end kind of work? Security? 
>** I hate to say it, but I don't know where to go after those certs either. Gettin' your foot in the door aint easy. I wish you [[luck]].

Ah, yep! Currently working as a contract [[SOC Operator|https://www.comptia.org/content/articles/what-is-a-security-operations-center]], and working on getting my certs for CompTIA, but I find myself getting side-tracked with my ~~obsession~~ hobby of tinkering with various things, which is where I picked up front-end stuff from, along with TiddlyWiki.  

>[[My wife]] is a worldclass [[librarian|https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/qmzu53/to_all_the_intps_what_do_you_do_for_work/hje5ivf/]], if you want to speak with her for advice or perspective.

I'll have to take a bit to consider taking you up on the offer, as I'm still not quite sure what it is I'd like to do as far as career paths, and librarian is certainly one such path!  

>I respect that you teach yourself so much. If I read correctly, are you not attending college, perhaps because it is too expensive (time or money)?

Ah, yea- college is currently a bit too costly for me at the moment, though I am looking into loans and grants in case something really catches my fancy! But as of right now, I think I'll continue to pick up new skills and live life as a [[Jack of All Trades|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_of_all_trades,_master_of_none]] in hopes of becoming a [[Polymath|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath]] like [[DaVinci|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci]]!   

>* You still thinking about A Hope For an Immortal Mind? 
>** ML with one's TW seems an interesting approach to something similar (though not identical*).

I am~ I am~, I think an ideal existence is one where we can choose our endtimes, so we don't miss out on our ambitions and loved ones, or leave any loose ends to our work! Though I suppose people wouldn't be as motivated to do the things they are doing without the reaper looming over them.

I use my TW in a similar way to how [[Soren|https://www.sorenbjornstad.com/]] uses his, with navigating by tags, and storing my thoughts, ideas, and useful links to things in it, somewhat to achieve this Second-brain type archiving, but also to keep track of my fleeting thoughts. My ADD/ADHD Inattentive leaves me with a very slippery train of thought, much like if it's conductor was fueling it with NOS!

>Did your senses of taste and smell ever grow undistorted for you?

Some of it has (or I have unconsciously replaced my old memory of that taste/smell with a new one) but I find certain things to still have a very different taste/smell still, one such thing being coke (the drink).

>Of course, I'm a fan of many of your software picks. If at all anymore, which specific software keeps you stuck on Windows?

Hm, well off the top of my head, [[Clip Studio Paint|https://www.clipstudio.net/en/]] is a big anchor as far as why I can't make the swap to GnuLinux full time, along with how there is still a few small hiccups with using Linux on a surface pro device, though I'm hoping with the release of the [[SteamDeck|https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck]] and the accompanying [[SteamOS 3.0|https://9to5linux.com/valve-says-steamos-3-0-will-be-available-for-everyone-to-download-and-install]] as well as the improvements being made to [[Krita|https://krita.org/en/]], Linux will become mainstream enough for me to put it on the rest of my devices, such as my Surface Pro 6, and my [[GPD Win 3|https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/gpd-win3-the-world-s-1st-handheld-aaa-game-console#/]], instead of Wndows 10.

>* As to your [[firearms arguments|https://www.reddit.com/r/Bossfight/comments/nsjx59/tank_man_bane_of_the_ccp/h0oob65/]], I'd add that Saint Marx argues the workers must maintain their arms, and by force, if necessary. 
>** Speaking of 3D-printed guns, this may be of interest: https://ghostgunner.net/

I agree with the Saint in regards to the right to bear arms, maybe it's my political views, but I see a world with everyone respecting a firearm to be safer than a world where very few know how to correctly handle one, mainly because a criminal will get a gun illegally where a civilian isn't allowed to have one and will end up in a pinch, but with everyone possessing a firearm, you have 1 malicious firearm bearer, versus the rest of the world. Much better odds for justice imo.

And Yes! I love looking into the new possibilities of what 3D printing is capable of! I was just watching a [[Vice City YouTube Video|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4dBuPJ9p7A]] about a ghost gun competition held in held down in Florida, and some of the firearms are absolutely amazing in both their aesthetic designs and their overall durability and functionality.

however, I do see both sides to this coin, as with them being more accessible, it also makes them more readily available to those will ill intent, and being harder to track, makes it a bit more dangerous as well.

It actually gave me a fun little story idea about someone being a data-runner, sort of like mirrors edge, where they would smuggle not drugs and firearms, but microsd card with files of illegalized pdf's and firearm 3d print schematics, in a world not unlike that of 1984.

>In addition to TailOS, I'd like to recommend Whonix.

I've played with Whonix in the past, and it is a technical marvel for cyber privacy to say the very least, though I find Tails a bit more practical in the way that I can keep it on a [[tiny plastic usb|https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-256GB-Ultra-Flash-Drive/dp/B07857Y17V/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=small+usb+drive&qid=1643574006&sr=8-3]] that I can easily dispose of via microwave, lighter, or stomach acid via consumption, as a last resort.

>* I [[hope]] your sister has gotten good use out of that switch. How do you feel about the Surface Pro, assuming you still use it? You on a Thinkpad now? 
>** I know several people who use graphics tablets, but, unfortunately, I've none that I can recommend. I'm hoping you can find a cheap, but powerful laptop. My daughter has a Wacom One, though it has had some problems. 
>** I was just mentioned [[GPD|2022.01.27 - ALM: We <3 Technology]] to a friend, though not the Win. Hawt AF. I'm jelly, homie.

Oh she plays it off and on when she isn't playing Minecraft with me and my brothers, I'm happy to have found it a good home where it can be played regularly haha

Oh the [[Wacom One|https://www.wacom.com/en-us/products/pen-displays/wacom-one]] is a fantastic entry level display tablet (unless you mean the same named non-display tablet, to which i say, Wacom dropped the ball with naming it, but it is also a fantastic device!) and personally a favorite of mine, since it can be used with any device that supports [[OTG|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB_On-The-Go]], and is especially cool with devices like the Samsung phones, where it has Dex, and the One can serve as a monitor for it! (though I guess at that point a Samsung Tab or something of the sort would be more practical?)

Oh yea the GPD made devices are absolutely amazing! Though, still a bit overpriced if you ask me, as my wallet is still mad at me for getting my Win 3, but very nice. I wish their Quality Control was a bit more reliable, as they are a bit [[infamous for some things getting a little botched, sadly.|https://www.reddit.com/r/GPDPocket/comments/8isq8p/exploding_gpd_pocket/]]

I was looking into the [[OneMix 4|https://www.1netbook.com/businesepc/onemix-4/]] as a replacement for my Surface Pro 6, though it's waaay to expensive for me to go for as of right now, if you like what GPD has made, I think you'll appreciate it as much as I do!

>[[This|https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/og6dcv/what_moment_made_you_say_yep_im_definitely_dead/h4jnrv3/]] sounds like hell.

Haha yea... I still feel a tingle of phantom pain every time I remember that. I think I went a good few weeks of just being terrified of walking on that dock, but I got over it!

>*I'm a fan: "[[platonism at my core, but pragmatism in practice.|https://www.reddit.com/r/INTP/comments/pws9wv/which_one_are_you_explain_your_own_philosophy_if/hemirya/]]" =) 
>** I hope you continue to wrestle with your [[faith]] too. 
>*** I'd be interested to see an analysis on where it is fitting to attempt to impose one's views in any context, not just a belief in God. 
>*** [[This|https://www.reddit.com/r/ask/comments/q693ta/do_you_believe_in_god/hgdh3cs/]] is one perspective. =D.

I agree. Everyone is entitled to believe in whatever it is they wish to, and others imposing theirs over someone else's is a violation in my book.

Oh, I remember that post! I am a firm believer that right and wrong are arbitrary terms, being fully subjective.

After all, its all just [[A Matter of Perspective.]] (My favorite phrase! The full phrase is "Time is a Matter of Perspective, and Perspective is a Matter of Time."

I use it as often as I can, as it in my eyes is the best way to sum up existence.) and politics is no different, with people of all views thinking their way is better or more just, when in reality, it's all the same, in that it has pros and cons, actions and reactions.

>Still thinking about Arch? I've been trying out JuNest, and I'm impressed by it (simple to try out on Mint, too, [[Outopos: Meh]]). Manjaro is worth your time; 4/6 people in my household prefer it. If you want to move to Arch later, you can. pacman/yay/Arch-wiki are the shit, homie.

Oh I'm so tempted to bite the bullet and go for Arch, especially hearing how the new edition of SteamOS will be built atop Arch, and I can happily say Manjaro would be my first stop in learning it haha

>*If I understand correctly, you can use both TW and Obsidian together (though it's a bit hackish). 
>** Sounds like you already know more about TW than I do. /salute.

Ah, I think I know what you're referring to, I've seen some ways of combining them, however I find myself a bit too comfortable to leave my current TW setup haha One day, I might look into Obsidian though, it looks like a really interesting bit of software.

And I will agree to disagree! I'm a mere novice still when it comes to TW, and from a look of [[your blog|https://philosopher.life/#Root:Root%20%5B%5BLegal%20Notice%5D%5D]] you have waaay more experience than do!

fwoo, man- that was a Lot to type haha, hopefully this covers a good deal! let me know if there is anything else you'd like to know :D
