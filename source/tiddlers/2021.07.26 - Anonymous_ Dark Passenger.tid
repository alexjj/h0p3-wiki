You: What games you like?

Stranger: Ps4

Stranger: No in my phone

Question to discuss:
dirty roulette jujuandmike or rates

You: I have no idea what that means.

Stranger: countless footsteps and two small ones that I haven't forgotten

You: Hrm. I don't know what that means either.

Stranger: sweet and loud music

Stranger: a night of light where no child sleeps

You: Ah, google shows me some results.

Stranger: heh

Stranger: good song

You: I keep a list of music that I listen to quite a bit

Stranger: oh?

Stranger: what kinds?

You: https://philosopher.life/#Music%3A%20Library

You: All kinds.

You: I prefer instrumentals, I think.

Stranger: i like those when I 'm drawing

You: I have some kind of auditory processing disorder that makes lyrics not stand out clearly for me.

You: Yeah, they are great for concentrating.

Stranger: oh, then these one's might be even harder to understand

Stranger: sometimes the pronunciation is off

You: Voices become like instruments for me too, so it's not bad.

Stranger: that's a good way of looking at that

You: So what are you doing on this website?

Stranger: spamming lyrics and sometimes having conversations

You: What does spamming the lyrics do for ya?

You: Seeing if anyone recognizes it? Maybe joins in, shibboleth or something?

Stranger: yeah, sometimes people do their own, but I'm looking also for people that recognize it

Stranger: they never have lmao

Stranger: but they recognize the game it comes from

Stranger: Guilty Gear Strive

Stranger: sometimes anyways

You: I was just speaking with another person who was a fan of PS4 games.

You: I don't play many standard [[games]] these days (https://philosopher.life/#Games).

You: What makes for a good conversation for ya?

Stranger: hmmm

Stranger: back and forth, mostly

Stranger: also

Stranger: I can't get that website loading

You: Takes a while. Very slow.

You: Loading a giant single html page into your browser. If you are on mobile, you'll be waiting a while.

Stranger: eh, even my regular internet sucks ass

Stranger: 1.5 mb/s

You: Holy fuck.

You: That is a crime against [[Humanity]].

You: What kinds of tricks do you employ to survive on that?

Stranger: phone would be faster lmaoooooo

Stranger: the site looks, nice from the background finally loading in

Stranger: did you make it?

You: (I'm old enough that 56k modems were dope to me at one point).

You: I did. I write a lot on it.

Stranger: I don't survive lmao

Stranger: it's frustrating

You: You can download the page from your browser to use it completely offline (easy [[privacy]] for you too).

Stranger: it reminds me of the Serial Experiments Lain Fan Site

You: You are not the first to say that. =).

Stranger: oh?

You: I'm a huge fan of that series as it were.

Stranger: Let's All Love Lain

You: Yeah, plenty of [[anon]]s from 4chan have expressed something along those lines.

Stranger: ah, makes sense lmaooooo

You: Do you like to read or write?

You: I'm always looking for something interesting to read (though I cannot say I'm skilled).

Stranger: hmmm

Stranger: I can write and I can read very well, but I don't

Stranger: I mostly play games

You: I'm a linkslut too, so, anything that strikes you, lay it on me.

You: How long you been gaming?

Stranger: since I was 3 hahahah

Stranger: I'm 21 now

You: damnson!

You: That's hardcore.

You: Top 5 Games of All Time are:...?

Stranger: first game system was gamecube and an M rated game. GUN

Stranger: hmm

You: You do any emulation on your PC?

Stranger: Terraria, Ultra Street Fighter IV, Smash Bros Melee

Stranger: oh yeah, definitely

Stranger: I upgraded from an FX-4130 and GT 610 to an i7 9700k and an RTX 2070 Super

Stranger: for emulation

You: If you ever need any isos, [[HMU|Contact h0p3]].

You: That's a hefty upgrade.

Stranger: oh? what systems?

Stranger: yeah, tell me about it

Stranger: windows would take like 4 minutes to start, now with an nvme ssd, it takes 10 seconds

You: Let's assume there's an 80% chance I can find it if it exists online.

You: NVME SSDs are hawt AF.

Stranger: DAMN RIGHT

Stranger: I never knew how much I neededd one

You: The bump in bus was exactly what I always wanted. Sata3 bottleneck kills me.

You: My current computer is [[monster-16]]. https://philosopher.life/#monster-16

Stranger: I WISH I COULD SEE IT LMFAOOOO

Stranger: I got a heavy airflow case

You: Once it loads, you can search the term "monster-16", and it'll pop up for ya

Stranger: PhanteksP500

Stranger: aight

You: You got watercooling?

Stranger: nah, was too nervous to do that since this was my first build

You: I hear that.

Stranger: the temps aren't bad though

You: Nice part about modern chips is that you can't really damage them easily from heat. They just downclock.

You: But, makes the room hot.

Stranger: yeah, a relief

You: Fuck that. It's so god damn hot this summer.

Stranger: I overclocked it to 4.9 on all cores

You: Noice.

Stranger: couldn't get 5.0 :(

You: probably got some sweet ass single-threaded performance

Stranger: I really wanted the 3080ftw3 from EVGA

Stranger: but that ain't coming any time soon

You: GPUs have been quite expensive since Covid

You: Hopefully, it will normalize

Stranger: I know... I paid 800 for a factory refurbished gpu

You: Lawd.

Stranger: worked out well though

Stranger: no problems

Stranger: except when I first hooked it up, my dumbass didn't put the 6+2 pin in all the way

Stranger: so it didn't start and scared me

You: I hate that feeling.

You: Dread.

You: It gets easier over time.

You: You'll feel more confident, especially if you can afford to wait for the build to go through.

Stranger: I know, especially since I've been saving up for a year, so I really didn't have money to replace it

You: Yes. I hear that.

You: The interval between my builds continues to grow.

You: I'm [[hoping]] my current system will last for 10 years (which is mind-boggling to a retarded geezer like me).

Stranger: geezer? how old are ya?

You: (Nobody knows this except those quite close to me, but soon enough, I'll be 36)

Stranger: that's not old, lmao

You: haha, well, I feel it. I'm almost completely grey. My oldest is 15yo.

Stranger: oh dang, you have a family too

You: Indeed. I [[love]] being a [[dad|Be A Good Dad]].

Stranger: I'm going to try, when I get kids ahahah

You: It's difficult to do for your generation. The costs only continue to climb.

You: I [[recent]]ly wrote about this in my [[HN Log]] (if and when you eventually get to take a look).

You: How many you hoping to have?

Stranger: Imma take a look. Might have to be when I get better internet though

Stranger: Hmm

Stranger: 3-5

You: Originally, that's what I was going to shoot for too.

Stranger: how many did you end up with?

You: 2

You: [[j3d1h]] is my daughter, and [[1uxb0x]] my son.

Stranger: that's not bad

Stranger: unique names

You: It's just the right number for me. I can barely serve them both as it is.

You: To match my name, [[h0p3]], and my wife's [[k0sh3k]].

You: The page you are loading is about 80 100k-word novels in length. It is my story. I try to preserve [[anonymity]] where fitting.

You: Hence the [[Leet]] [[name]]s.

Stranger: Make's sense

You: (All of these `[[foobar]]` are [[Link]]s inside the ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±)

You: Anyway, you got yourself an SO(s)?

Stranger: hmmm

You: I think finding [[intimacy]] is pretty damn hard to do these days.

Stranger: there's a girl I like

Stranger: I know...

Stranger: but um...

Stranger: she's in Canada

Stranger: I know I'm a fool to want her

You: Never know what might happen. Give it ten years. Maybe you'll finally see her in meatspace.

You: (hopefully wildly sooner!)

Stranger: I HOPE SO

You: You guys talk often?

Stranger: every day

Stranger: but um

Stranger: through text

Stranger: she's shy

You: I've got someone I'm hoping to meet in Canada here in a few months ([[DeathOfRobinhood]], and his newborn, and his wife, and hopefully his family).

You: Text is, by far, my favorite medium.

Stranger: I hope you get to meet them!

You: They might be shutting the borders down again, possibly, with this delta variant.

Stranger: yeah, it's awful

You: Maintaining relationships through text alone is really hard work.

Stranger: I know

Stranger: we've seen each other's faces though

Stranger: which was hard for me to do

You: #areyoume?

Stranger: I've never shared that with any other soul on the internet

You: Haha. Well, I'm glad that you did [[share]] with me. I treasure honesty and depth (not much of a [[smalltalk]]er, myself).

You: What was going through your head, what it feel like to see her and to reveal yourself to her?

Stranger: I was nervous that she'd think I was an ugly monster and laugh at me

You: lmao

You: She's gotta be into you. She likes the way you talk.

Stranger: but she called me handsome, a cutie, and said I have pretty eyes

Stranger: and she's beautiful herself

You: The possible reward of vulnerability is sometimes hard to fathom.

You: How far away from her are ya?

Stranger: yeah, makes you wonder if life is worth the risk to create

You: ha

Stranger: 37 hours away

You: Jesus.

You: Yup.

Stranger: 6 and a half by plane

You: Maybe migration is the path to take, if it gets serious enough.

Stranger: yeah, perhaps

You: Would you rather migrate to Canada or her to where you live?

Stranger: I prefer America... She prefers Canada

Stranger: I prefer Freedom of Speech though

You: Preach, yo!

Stranger: like, she's not afraid to make offensive jokes, but prefers canada like come on

You: Recently came across some freeze peach concerns in Canada.

You: Canada has a lot going for it too, if you can set aside the freespeech issues (and, I would not say the United States has a great record here either).

Stranger: She wants to live in the mountains and have 5 kids lmao

You: I totally fucking get that.

You: (as long as the internet is good)

Stranger: why would she tell me the number of kids she wanted if she didn't like me? She also tells me every time she takes a shower lmao

Stranger: LMAO

Stranger: It better be

You: Oh, well, she sounds spicy.

You: Should mirror that back.

Stranger: yeah haha, and we pretend cuddle most nights

Stranger: if she doesn't pass out

Stranger: She's also 5'1, which I like a lot

You: Like shawties?

Stranger: I've always had a thing for short women

Stranger: HELL YEAh

You: My wife is 5' on the money. I totally get that too. Completely edible.

Stranger: ahahahahahah

Stranger: She wishes she was 4'11!

Stranger: lmao

You: You write her any [[Letter]]s?

Stranger: hmmm, we've only known each other for 3 weeks, she hasn't given me an address yet

You: Oh, dope. That's moving fast.

Stranger: hopefully the candle lasts long

You: My wife and I knew each other for a decent while before she asked me out. Only went on a single date. Married after that.

Stranger: FAST

You: I just knew, homie.

You: [[Lucky]] as they come.

Stranger: my parents were like that. Only knew each other for like 5 months and moved into together and got married a few months later

You: They still together?

Stranger: yeah

Stranger: since 1999

You: Do you like their relationship?

You: (I admire aspects of mine)

Stranger: Yeah, I suppose

You: (they clearly care a great deal for each [[other]])

Stranger: I just hope I don't mess it up with this girl

You: Yup. `/nod`. I know that feel.

You: I can't say I know much about this world.

You: I'm ridiculously autistic.

You: I've been on dates and didn't even know I was on them.

You: So, take a retard's perspective with an incredible grain of salt.

Stranger: oh dang. I'm not sure if I'm autistic. I'm always having conversations with others in my head

Stranger: like

Stranger: I can predict what my mom and dad will say

You: You practice having conversations with 'em? Stand in the shower arguing with the phantoms? You {[[dream]]} about your relationships often?

Stranger: I've had shadow arguments hahahah

Stranger: and ... yeah

You: Pretty sure everyone does that.

You: Seems like a good idea.

Stranger: I've dreamt a lot of possible relationships since I was 13 hahah

Stranger: pretty sad, I know

You: lmao

You: Naw

Stranger: like

Stranger: the girl would just be a silhouette

Stranger: so that it could be any girl

You: It's our mission to [[Find The Other]], homie. We can never complete ourselves or make our stories fully coherent, but I think [[love]] is as close as we get to it.

You: I think it's rational and good thing to recognize your need.

Stranger: It's my main reason for living

You: `/salute`. Yes, sir*(?). It's a damned [[good]] reason.

Stranger: DANG RIGHT AHAHAHAH

You: I'm a hiki. I live in my basement, literally. No judgment here. You a NEET, or how you making "progress" as parts of society usually define it?

You: (I'm sure it's an important part of getting from A to B with your girl in the end.)

Stranger: I just hate uncertainty

Stranger: do you get that?

You: Jesus. Stahp. lol

You: Yes.

You: Absolutely.

You: More than I know how to put into words.

Stranger: me too

You: A person I [[love]] beyond words sent this one to me: http://waxwingmag.org/items/issue23/9_Leonard-Statement-of-Teaching-Philosophy.php

You: Right on topic.

Stranger: It sucks knowing how I feel in absolutes and then go on to another's heart

Stranger: damn

You: Yeah. She hit the nail on the head.

You: What do you do with your un[[certainty]]?

Stranger: I guess I just live with it

Stranger: hard to fight fate

You: Hrm. That's fascinating.

Stranger: But maybe my fate is all just in my head

You: They aren't logically inconsistent notions. An agent can be uncertain with respect to X, and X can be fated at the same time.

Stranger: if I just sit and do nothing , of course nothing is going to happen

You: That sounds more like determinism. Like a machine that does exactly what it's programmed to do in its environment.

You: You're plastic though. You're not just a machine. You have choices. You can change. It's up to you.

Stranger: I've only fought my preconceived fate a few times and it burned me. But that's life. Nothing will change if I don't try to make it

You: I hear that.

Stranger: That's why I'm trying with this girl

You: Gotta have [[hope]] to have ambition.

Stranger: this is the hardest I've ever tried

You: It's courage, homie.

Stranger: I've also begun working out again

You: Noice.

You: That shit is excellent for depression.

Stranger: to that song I shared from the beginning haha

Stranger: damn right it is

You: I need to do it too.

Stranger: I'm uh

You: It's laziness on my part.

Stranger: 271

You: 225 here, and I'm a manlet. I'm straight-up fat.

You: (another reason I think I prefer shawties...)

Stranger: I definitely have some muscle, my whole family are strong freaks of nature, but I've definitely let my self go in places

Stranger: I'm 5'10

Stranger: with a big frame

You: I do my [[Fitness Routine]] in spurts. I miss lifting though.

You: Walking seems to do me the most good. You ever walk with your girl?

You: It's fire.

Stranger: no lmao, I've never tried to date a girl irl

Stranger: well

Stranger: there was a girl when I was in 4th grade

Stranger: but I couldn't give her the chocolates

Stranger: she used to share her lunches with me

You: Adorable

Stranger: I haven't seen her since I was 12... she went on to homeschooling

You: Don't think I had any girls who shared their lunches with me.

You: Ah. I can appreciate that. I [[homeschool]] my offspring as well.

Stranger: at a young age

Stranger: I've never taken shit

Stranger: or let other's take it

Stranger: My size usually scared most people off

You: That [[help]]s, no doubt.

Stranger: like when this guy was harassing my mom late one night at a gas station a year ago

Stranger: he was drunk, but I don't care

Stranger: I yelled at him "what the fuck do you think you're doing?" and I never swear in front of my parents

You: lmao

You: How'd your mom react to that?

Stranger: she just continued into the store lmaoooo

Stranger: I then get out of the car and square up with the guy

Stranger: they're always talk

Stranger: never the action to back anything up

You: Most of it is mere signaling.

Stranger: his friend and sis/gf had to pull him away from me

Stranger: then I made him apologize to my mom

You: What did he say to her?

Stranger: I don't remember the exact words, but he said he wouldn't want his mom to have to feel scared either

Stranger: He's lucky he apologized

Stranger: I don't like to admit this. But I've always had the itch to fight someone

You: Sometimes defection requires defection. I can appreciate his line of reasoning in that apology.

Stranger: my whole family has a problem with people pissing us off

Stranger: we don't take kindly to it

You: Strong anti-social elements in mine. Tons of violence.

You: It's an expensive responsibility. Rarely is it wielded wisely, in my experience.

Stranger: Ours isn't a violence for violence's sake though. It's justified to us

You: Oh, well, I know my extended family would say the same. But, they are often wrong. Justification for violence is hard to generate well, but I agree violence is sometimes necessary for [[Justice]].

You: You practiced any MMA?

Stranger: nah, though I have an mma punching bag

Stranger: and a speedbag

Stranger: nor have I played sports, though people wanted me to

Stranger: even though I'm a mega nerd

Stranger: always tried to get me to play football

You: Been a while since I've practiced boxing.

You: Sometimes it can get it out.

Stranger: I respect boxing the most

You: It's a gorgeous [[art]]form.

Stranger: wish more saw it that way

Stranger: I used to want to be a boxer

Stranger: still could try, I suppose

You: I think [[Wrestling]] is my favorite (legit, not pro).

Stranger: That's respectable, too

You: They get to control where the fight goes in the end.

Stranger: I like pro though, because it's really just a hidden play

You: Drama and Soap Opera

Stranger: though, I can't say I like modern pro wrestling

Stranger: the outfits are boring

You: Back when I watched it, there was Hulk Hogan and The Undertaker...by the time The Rock rolled around, I was simply too ignorant of it all.

Stranger: I was a big fan of The Ultimate Warrior

Stranger: his outfit was my favorite

Stranger: and Andre the Giant

You: That motherfucker could drink.

You: Huge amounts.

Stranger: have you seen him hold a beer can????

Stranger: SCARY SHIT

You: Tiny little can, or so it appears.

Stranger: MASSIVE CHAD

Stranger: ahahahahh

You: Gotta say, I think some of the most important fights I've had in life were in [[silence]].

Stranger: In your head?

You: Some things need a voice, need to be said. Hard to put words to them. But, I mean a silence that I've chosen. Where I just said nothing. Stood or sat there with them. Tried to find a different route.

You: Very expensive.

Stranger: what did it cost you?

You: Anxiety.

You: I think it's one of the most expensive things to experience. Nature's way of telling us something is wrong. I don't always handle that emotion productively and constructively.

Stranger: me neither

Stranger: It's a destructive force

You: Indeed, sir.

You: Cooperation is often best done by turning the other cheek. Maybe you've heard of iterated prisoner's dilemmas. Well, the strategies that seem preferable in the end are those that can accept failures to cooperate from another player, and keep on trying to cooperate anyhow.

You: There's often noise and other factors that make it so that what seemed like a failure to cooperate wasn't actually. It's hard to judge someone's intentions.

You: I'm not good at that as an autistic person.

You: It's pretty common for me to run into misunderstandings.

You: I think that's one of the reasons I'm always ready to fight.

Stranger: I'll only fight for the right reason

Stranger: I control my anger better than most of my family tree

You: A gift and a choice.

Stranger: it's always back there though

You: I hear that.

Stranger: that's why I don't like to ever raise my voice

Stranger: and why I'm always as sweet as I can be

You: I've raised mine in places where I wish I could take it back.

Stranger: if only to keep the demon inside at bay

You: Yup. `/nod`. Hard work.

Stranger: me too.. I once threw a ball really hard behind the wall where my dad was sitting when I was younger. I don't think he's forgotten it

Stranger: out of anger

Stranger: This is why I'll never drink in my life

Stranger: I know what kind of drunk I'd be

You: Mine will surely never forget my anger as well. Finding ways to heal that relationship is hard.

You: Preach, yo!

You: That's smart.

Stranger: I've never sipped a lick

Stranger: nor have I smoked

Stranger: or done drugs

You: That makes sense to me.

Stranger: I like to have my sense all there all the time

You: Even when it hurts and sucks. Probably best to manage it while fully aware.

You: I think that will serve you well long-term, my friend.

Stranger: I know, it would probably make any problem worse. Being drunk

Stranger: I've seen alcoholism. Not in my home, but extended family. It ruined many of them

You: Alcoholism runs deep in my family tree. Hard to know how much damage it has done.

You: Escaping the problems of poverty, poorly.

Stranger: That's why I'm working to become an electrician

You: Fuck yes.

You: My brother is an extremely talented electrician.

You: [[JRE]]*

Stranger: HELL YEAH

You: I'm a pipefitter.

You: (little bit of overlap)

Stranger: both sides of my family had master electricians

Stranger: I've done some plumbing and construction work. At home though

Stranger: also

Stranger: fun fact about my family tree

Stranger: My Grandfather was the guy that wired the building in the Watergate scandal

You: No shit!? That's crazy, dude.

Stranger: and my grandmother, his wife, was gonna be the president after nixon's personal secretary

Stranger: she had tons of letter's of recommendations

You: That is crazy.

You: Oh, btw, I have a recommendation: International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers

Stranger: I'll look into that. I'm gonna go into Moore's because they have a program that pays for your training and also pays you for workign

You: Best training you'll find, your bosses will treat you better, you'll be able to drag-up and find another job easily enough, and the pay is wildly better.

Stranger: hmm, there's one in my state about 3 hours away

You: Oof. Yup.

You: Still worth the call.

You: I've traveled further for union before.

You: Would do it again.

Stranger: Thanks for the recommendation

You: `/salute`. NP.

You: And, good news is: job security.

You: Boomers are retiring, and average age of electrician is quite high.

Stranger: that is my biggest thing I'd need, for sure

You: Would you ever consider moving elsewhere in the states?

Stranger: that's hard to say

Stranger: I wouldn't mind

Stranger: personally

You: Might be easier to find work in more densely populated areas.

Stranger: but family, y'know

You: I hear that.

Stranger: I would travel everywhere if it weren't for them

Stranger: not that I'm angry

Stranger: I just don't want them to feel alone

Stranger: I dunno

You: I bet they'd manage with out, if they had to.

Stranger: but I also have to live my life

You: You could call your mom up every day.

You: (that's what I did with my wife and kids when I was traveling)

Stranger: She still calls her mom everyday

Stranger: everyday since 2007 when her dad died

You: I think I'd like your mom. She sounds kind.

Stranger: yeah, she's pretty nice

Stranger: we watch Dexter together lmao

You: That [[show|TV: Library]] is outstanding.

Stranger: I know man, we're on season 7 now

Stranger: she's already seen it

You: It's rewatchable.

You: Something to be said for rewatching shows.

Stranger: definitely, I already am !

Stranger: lmao

Stranger: shit

You: what?

Stranger: I didn't ask if you watched it all

Stranger: c

Stranger: c

You: Naw, don't worry.

Stranger: c

Stranger: Spoiler

You: I've seen it.

Stranger: ah good lmao

Stranger: my jaw dropped when Rita died in season 4

Stranger: fuckin' Trinity

You: What characters in fiction do you identify with the most?

Stranger: this is gonna sound bad

Stranger: Dexter to a degree

You: I can appreciate that.

You: It's a like a switch in me. I can turn my empathy off.

Stranger: especially him battling his dark passenger

You: Yup. I know that feel.

Stranger: and accepting it

Stranger: and sometimes Rei Ayanami, when I was 14

You: There's only so much that is up to us. We do the right thing because it's the right thing to do, whether or not our darkness pushes or pulls us toward or away from it.

You: [[Identifying With: Fictional Characters]]

Stranger: I used to identify as spongebob as a kid, now I'm more of a squidward

You: Oh, that reminds me of an [[awe]]some video I just saw recently.

Stranger: what is it?

Stranger: and also, I love Dale Gribble!

You: https://www.tiktok.com/@dancingsfinks/video/6944348546753727749

Stranger: KotH is one of my favorite shows

You: Hell yes. Show is the tits.

Stranger: LMAO I READ THAT AS SHOW US THE TITS

You: lol!

Stranger: It's gonna take a sec, my shitty internet

You: It's got the squidward thing going on

Stranger: The girl I like also sends me tiktoks she likes and it takes a bit to watch them lmao

You: I don't usually see myself in characters, but once in a while I do. It's a treat.

You: Anyway to improve that connection?

You: I think it's difficult to participate in a democracy with throughput that low.

Stranger: well, next month we're gonna go back to satellite. We've got shitty 1.5mb/s Century Link DSL

You: Are you way fucking out in the boonies?

Stranger: LMAO NO ONE ELSE I"VE SEEN HAS USED BOONIES

Stranger: thought we were alone with that word ahahahha

You: :P

Stranger: kinda , yeah

You: Ah, I'm from Kentucky, largely. It's a fine word.

You: Satellite is highly asymmetrical, but sometimes you can get decent downstream.

Stranger: and what's terrible is we were gonna get fixed wireless with a fiber optic backbone

Stranger: 50mb/s

Stranger: the lady on the phone told us "YEP PERFECT AREA, MAYBE EVEN 100 MB/S"

Stranger: but it was a lie

Stranger: we waited a month for them to come and tell us we're SOL

You: Ugh. I fucking hate marketers.

Stranger: I know

Stranger: I was livid

Stranger: I have tons of games I need to download

You: If you had extra cash, time, and resources, you could try to bind together multiple connections (it's possible to use a very specialized VPN in a datacenter to make it so that you can add throughputs together for a single connection).

Stranger: I JUST WANNA PLAY DEVIL MAY CRY V and STREET FIGHTER V

You: Do you find yourself lugging a machine or external drive to another location with a decent connection to download all the things?>

Stranger: nah, but I downloaded at a hotel before

Stranger: it's how I downloaded Final Fantasy X and X-2 HD Remaster and Yakuza 0 years ago

Stranger: dude... since I live with my folks still atm, there's 3 of us on 1.5mb/s

You: Impossible.

Stranger: so when it comes down to it. I download games at like.... 80kb/s

You: I would die.

Stranger: I feel like I am lmao

You: I tell ya, I keep my site updated on Resilio Sync too (basically like mutable torrents). It's a nice P2P tool for passively downloading updates (which are daily).

Stranger: I've only ever torrented anime and some games hahah

Stranger: like big rom dumps of old games

Stranger: new games PS2 and up, take ages to download

You: QoS on your router can help there some.

You: I fondly remember the days of downloading files at those speeds.

You: Literally, days.

You: lol

Stranger: LMAO

Stranger: I"M STILL THERE

Stranger: RURAL BUMFUCK VIRGINIA SUCKS

You: I just moved from Johnson City a couple years ago. Traveled through Virginia (my wife's fam is from there) often enough.

You: I play [[magic]], and they've got Starcitygames there.

Stranger: you play MtG?

You: Well, with my offspring these days, but that's it. Used to be a more serious player. Won a lot of money playing it.

Stranger: I've only ever played with friends and family

Stranger: got a bunch of free cards online, actually

Stranger: dude was giving away his whole collection

You: I think it might be the best game there is, at least tabletop wise.

Stranger: It's really enjoyable

You: I got my start from a friend who just gave me his collection.

Stranger: I really like the art, too

Stranger: I always made a green deck

You: You ever them custom cards? Lawd. Hawt AF.

You: Green's a delightful color. All the gains.

Stranger: I haven't played in years though...

You: A moneypit as it is anyway. It's more fun to think about [[Magic]] than to play it anyway.

Stranger: There's a game on steam called Table Top Simulator, if you've heard of it

Stranger: and you can just download cards and whatnot

You: Indeed. I was recently gifted this one.

Stranger: not the same as physical, but still

You: I play [[games]] only under particular circumstances these days. It's quite rare. I'm an addict, and I've got too many other problems to solve. I'd lose myself in it if I did it.

You: As an autist, I can just hyperfocus into oblivion on it. Time flies.

Stranger: That's me and Civilization 5

You: Ha. That game is way cool.

Stranger: I've lost actual days to it

Stranger: Just... one... more... turn

You: It's a like skinnerbox.

You: I need to hit the sack. I speak with a lot of people. If you had a pseudonym that you'd like me to call you, what would it be?

Stranger: hmmm

You: Maybe we'll be able to stay in [[contact]].

Stranger: I dunno lmao

Stranger: I might contact you later on that website of yours

You: Cool. Hope you do.

You: It's been a pleasure and an honor speaking with you.

Stranger: same to you, my good man

You: TTYL. Sleep well.

Stranger: Sleep well, dude!

You have disconnected.
