title: 2022.06.05 - NemoRevera: Breath of Fresh Air

"""
[13:40:33][NemoRevera] Your website was a breath of fresh air in intellectual synthesis
[13:40:43][NemoRevera] Just leaving my respect to you
[14:27:40][h0p3] Thank you, [[nomad]]. That's very kind of you. I do my best.
[14:28:07][h0p3] I'm happy to read and think* about what you make as well, if you ever have the [[chance]] to [[reveal|Fostering Intimacy]] yourself.
[14:40:39][h0p3] You have an interesting name. You spend a lot of time outdoors?

[9:07:00][NemoRevera] My pleasure, really. There are few blogs where a certain cliche exposee reigns all over. Nick Land (altough I mostly didn' acgree with him) had some really fascinating blogs.
[9:08:56][NemoRevera] Oh, thank you. I do write some essays and fiction. And I have a Substack, but my virulent perfectionism has led me to wait and take my time to sharp my intelect.
[9:16:47][NemoRevera] It is quite a personal name for me. It depends, I like to walk in the woods, reveries thinking about thing and sitting outside to read. What about you?
[9:17:04][NemoRevera] *things
[9:18:01][h0p3] I [[like]] walking with [[others]] outdoors. I spend an enormous amount of time on my [[computer|m16]]. 
[9:18:46][h0p3] I've spent most of my life with a lot of woods around me. Strongly my preference.
[9:20:01][h0p3] If and when you do reveal your work, please let me know. I can appreciate waiting to get it how you want it. 
[9:20:20][h0p3] What do you do to survive in the world?
