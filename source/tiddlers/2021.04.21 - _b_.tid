Mere legal positivistic rule of law does not imply or generate equality sufficient for [[justice]]. Equality (equity, or whatever the word you want to use) comes in higher: orders, priorities, and consequences. A law that forbids both the wealthy and the poor does not necessarily solve the problems of inequality that matter. Juridical laws require moral justifications, and, unfortunately, even Saint Marx (who took himself to be engaged science and history in his economics) fails in this regard.

Insofar as "the customer always gets what they want" tends to be true, it's in virtue of the fact that capitalists are the valued customers who buy competing shares of proletariat-exploitation structures to buy whatever else they want. They buy increasing degrees of human enslavement.

I doubly do not trust those who have optimistic predictions with low expectations of others. Holding both is often a conveniently convivial appearance that masks a hypocritical dark-triad within. It's a special lie people tell themselves. In projecting what they want others to feel, they seek the social passwords for pursuing their own pleasure without accountability. It is the Rand-Locke memeplex shielding itself with malicious just-world prosperity teachings. Don't harsh my mellow vibe, bruh.

In capitalism, subscribers narcissistically pay to be flattered by having their own worldviews echoed back to them while playing a socially accepted rationalization token in The Spectacle that signals they've paid for an 'objective' perspective. Yet again, note the crucial difference between morally virtuous virtue-signaling and mere instrumental virtue-signaling.

Science shaped, funded, owned, and operated by capitalists (even via shells of indirect influence) makes something 'useful' for capitalists. Mere usefulness is not good enough: mere means can never be an end in itself. The dowager empress of all disciplines, philosophy, gives you reasons, both abstract and practical, not to be a selfish, apathetic, nihilistic coward or worse. It gives us justification to use science, to fittingly work toward something objectively good in the world. Being moral is the only means to deserving our happiness.
