title: 2021.10.07 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Art of Faith

We’re living in a fluid universe, in which the art of faith is not in taking one’s stand, but in learning to swim.

Do you take your claim, itself something you hold in [[faith]] at some level, to be subject to itself? The paradox of tolerance comes for you too. I'll agree there is a [[gfwiwcgws]] to the [[art]] of [[faith]], using our freedom in our [[4DID]] to eventually construct+discover the best approximations of necessity [[itself]], particularized to our contexts. I agree that parts of our universe are fluid, [[changing|change]], and contingent, but that is only in virtue of necessity. It's not an absolutely fluid universe ([[ITS]] and your own, obviously), and even our own conception of it cannot be absolutely fluid. Hence, we must swim to find the stands worth taking, the tentpegs worth putting down that may or may not become permanent fixtures of The City in all its scopes (personal and interpersonal). An overemphasis on fluidity is a postmodern infection (dating back to to Saint Heraclitus). Yes, it is magma that becomes stone, even into all possible heat deaths toward The Absolute.
