; A Textual Tour of the Dire-Straited Zoo of Contemporary Online Philosophical Discussion, Including the Most Popular Exhibits of Hateful Heidebearians, Asinine Aristotterilians And Woeful Wittgenlionians (Random Words, Showerthoughts, Google Translate, Thesaurus Masturbation and GPT-3 Text [According to My Various Censors and Commenters])

On sea-faring adventure dans le navire noble of epistemophilic polymathglot anthropopoesis, rápidamente the disjecta membra of anti-glossolalist hate comments and general Hass vers my logorrheic, phanopoeic and fairly Buddhic lexical endeavours est devenu más común than your modest decollated wordsmith would have tolutiloquently befürchtet. No solo have heresiological I and meine humble altigrams ya he atraído my fair share of chuckleheaded e-Feinde, that además de not supporting la stylistique bohème of my lex orandi, credendi textwork, are sehr eager poster headstrong (pour moi pulchritudinous) “hate comments” acerca de my wooly-minded, fickle, pig-brained blog, and qui are happy 禁止する my innocent compte for simplemente trying widerstehen the menticidal hyporeality of worldwide linguistic hegemony, et erklären the whence, how and whither of my ontos. Bevor I continue avec my in equal parts panlogist, Thelemite and Mahasamadhi autophany, je sens it is incumbent responder to the Orwellian defamation, deplatforming and expurgation con which my many bowdlerised, puerile and zweifellos green-eyed monoglotic/kakodaemonic (quelle est la différence?) critics have lambasted saya. As a good 友達, Néricault once dit, “La critique est aisée, et l’art est difficile.” The lang and drôle story of how I échappé the acculturation process, became an Ipsissimus logophile (mit aphantasic detractors and simulacrum-befuddled Lassallists galore!), is clairement nein of great Interesse to the diversivolent cultureme-spewing online landlubbers who have made up their labile and instinctual pendapat que my Daseinal project is trop zenitic, aleatoric and polyphrenic for their definitionistic ego quests and xenocentric cakeism, and have juberously 決定しました to jettison their blunt torpedoes of bon mots στο the impeccant vaporetti of my pot-valiant translingual journey. Peut-être the sonar of this smatchet of a cynical polymonster kapal should have kenned these erotophobic epiphenomenalists from the get-go, mais it seems the raging high seas of Malinchist sociocultural embeddedness, and the torrents of omphaloparetic philoptosis are unmöglich échapper. Mi única esperanza now is que the pareidolic riptides and metataxic crosscurrents of criticism continue dejarme and my jugendlich, syncromystic mente only tickled pink.

; Believing in Yourself; Or, Maintaining Positive Ego States While Navigating Dolorous Meatspace

En la tatterdemalion agonía of temporospatial bondage, and the metacognitive egodystonia of sustaining biolinguistic embodied cognitive states que potamologically flow from the alluvial תְּהוֹם of phantasmagoric χρόνος, it can be far demasiado fácil to let the norepinephrinergic urges of self-criticism dan self-deprecation feoff the cratylistic pissing contest の technomodern macrocognition. Unglücklicherweise pour the philosophiles, gnosophiles, and cynophiles of אדמה, the vagile procatalepsis and percentage taking typical of cacophonous kakistocracy se ha convertido the trendsetting and inignorable siglums of kerygmatic postmodernity. Pour the satu or dua of us who irgendwie have managed to agnise the verity of these circumstances, et ne se sont pas shot themselves, it’s peu probable that the ullage of allothetic, anstatt idiothetic, dominion will pronto incite a tipo doloroso of Weltschmerz, Sehnsucht and ziemlich possibily sorrowful lacrimation acerca de the lonesome valley of logophilia. The plebeians and possibilians of theological noncognitivism (autsch!) will simply nuncna entenderán the hedonophobic 憂苦 and menyakitkan prairie madness typical of essayant, contra all odds, construir a coherent and euthymic self-image pendant being découragé, objektiviert and rechazado by the unanimistic et geradeheraus superficial languaculture of the fickle hoi polloi. Je puedo only speak por mi self, of course, and a pesar de que I would like to think of moi même as someone que es razonablemente self-aware, the fractal nature of existentiality bedeutet that my quiddity will not nécessairement accord with otros. Dans un sens, I have zugeben that the ursine отвечать to the Frage posed in the admittedly jentacular titre is que there is none to the whys and wherefores of orienteering the Verstand in the labryinthine corridors of Hyperreality. Withal, taking it día a día, I can only continue intentando to build a nascent and overripe connection avec future budding logophobes on the largo y sinuoso camino of the latitudinous lifestream.

Est-ce that one peut dire that the decrepitating bio-cybernetic wetware of worldwide dulciloquency is a tribalism which has to be akzeptiert, or a Zugzwang that can only, pour ainsi dire, be Pyrrhicised? Consider en ce qui concerne the gouache of sememes to be an easel on which to valorise and vivisepulture, garnished with the acrylics and Danish oils of indexical shades… cokelat, naranja und so weiter. Contrastando eso with the shallow collective of monolingual hypocognitivity that we souvent find in the illocutionary virtuous cycle of 21st Jahrhundert cacoepy, hay algunos that would prétendent such an //en plain air// and Pollockain style serait too maximilist and non-photorealistic.

; The Double-Edged Sword of Creativity

La exnovation of ritualcide is a //bête noire//, por lo menos of the occipital variety, que continues endemoniar both the ochlophobiac and the ochlophiliac. It is an αλήθεια customarily concurred with que the blaue κόσμος is packed to the gunwales with creatautology, be it fractal, Lagrangian or melittological. Однако, saya have 何度も observed that the poly-surfeit of onolaty in the agathist rationes seminales can lead to a striking disjunction por lo que respeta a the opalescence (plain and simple) of bipedal-(Homo narrans)-ity. It might semble that my immediate auxology of the saltationism of Kreativität is trop negative, too wordish, too saurophagus. Aber the problema is that je have unwittingly become one of, as it was, l’oligarchie of divine schematonics, paedotrophically and oligotrophically embattled to metabolise the etymology of true aesthetic 作成. El idea that has accordingly longtemps reworked the somatic markers of my psychophysiology, and still does, est how transcender the Athymhormia of dieser Zustand. My intent نیست  sugerir in this scrow that ich have (at last) shamanised the true seity et sorrow of la situación. אבל, my thesis statement—jika esto can be denominated sebuah tesis—is que one cannot help constater that vaccimulgence por lo general a its roots in the washland of introversatile enchantment. Was mich betrifft me, au cours des années, it seems increasingly my ego deems the saber of googol-pointed creativity double-eged: einerseits, il y a l’éternelle question of how expresser the wyrd of one’s woe, andererseits, existe o problema of comment to synchronise the melancholy Ananke of intent with the predestination of ultramental, sociohistorical (probably Splengerian) existentiality. Comme you pouvez le voir, this блог and the altigrammal writing style con suerte devenir (only) one chemin that I tardiloquently embattle myself contra the Gartner hope cycle of 美的 osmosis.

; Wer am moi?

~~//In which Mr آدم makes his first post.//~~

//In which I make my first post//

Ahoy to the première official acta diurna de Logophile's Elysium. It werd be an achrondroplasiac start, in which yours truly (monad of consciousness and bundle von sensations), begins to attempt to reify мой very own anima, self-concept and star-crossed ブログ. Genealogical bewilderment of the third culture kid variety would be sans surprise, as je know all too well that it est as scarce as hen's teeth to find one who sabe how parler in such a polylingual, polymathic and extrêmement fun! lexicology.

Mais que about my environs and co-humans? In terms de the biological organisations que anthropomorphise the Umwelt of the melange of metanoia, yo soy abutted by Tellurians who do not, at least as of this plot, comprennent or affirm my rather quotidian scouse of a ψυχή. Das kann be difficult sein, the carnism of confirmation bias being such that yo confess to having introjected the closedthought of extrasomatic dependency as the bastion of schizotypy. Natheless, my 希望 is that avec the ad fontes mental ministrations of this new florilegium, it will be mir möglich sein to develop an en bonne santé relationship entre sclerodermous anthropomorphisation y zoophilic embodiment.

Bienvenue again to Logophile's Elysium, the word lovers' heaven, and por favor subscribe!

I don't think it's just me: I think your writing is becoming, on average, more legible (for now*). I could imagine the larger the wall of the text, the more likely one would be to slip into such a perversion. =D.

Hello! 

{{Text Art: Welcome!}}

I think that's fair to say, and both in the sense that I would [[like]] to and in the sense that I try to in this ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱. It's not an easy task. And, I have to say, I'm sorry to see how few constructive comments or even positive signals you've received online. I am not surprised by it, but I remain disturbed by the [[dok]] of censorship you're experiencing. If at all, where else will you be syndicating? Do you have any other parts of your [[PSM]] for me to consider?

Thank you again for your work.

I could imagine you're called a bot and schizo pretty often. It's downright neopentacostal. From one retard^^tm^^ to another, I'm [[grateful]] for your generous symbols, [[nomad]]. Thank you, sir! `/bow`. I'm terrible with poetry, and I [[hope]] you'll forgive me for being a poor interpreter.
