title: 2020.12.11 - Prompted Introspection: Peace Obstacle

!! What is your biggest obstacle toward peace?

That I'm not convinced I ought to pursue such a thing simply because it would make me hedonically happy. Oh, I would like inner peace, political peace, and all the other peaces pieced together too. Of the many varieties I've encountered, the existential, religious, political, and philosophical programs of progress of so-called enlightenment<<ref "e">> are rarely justified. I'll agree that some aspects of my life can justifiably grow more peaceful, but I can see struggle, combat, wrestling, and seeking are obligated. I have a much simpler practical<<ref "tm">> answer though: people. A world of decent humans in decent relation to each other would make for a much more peaceful life for me.<<ref "l">> I think even a push from 3% to 60% would likely do it. I obviously don't predict that, and I've tried to make my peace with that to some extent.

I try to find a fitting peace, to sustain contentment on average if I can, to achieve what [[dok]] of eudaimonia is justified. Under the entailment of justification in an unjust world, it's not up to me at some point. Fittingly empathizing with [[others]] does not allow it. What kind of person would I be if I were at peace while so many suffered? As I have pointed out, even [[stoicism|Redpilled Stoicism]] is usually a quick trip to dark-triadicism. It's part of why I continue to shred in [[Wiki Litmus Test]] too.
