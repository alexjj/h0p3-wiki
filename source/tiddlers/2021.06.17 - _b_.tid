When I look at the middle class (those who do not live completely off the exploitation of workers [unless they are managers, in most cases], though they may to some extent, including through the stonk market), I am convinced they are motivated by an egoistic fear of losing their material privilege, being willing to give up not only their own liberties (an immorality against themselves), but even worse, failing to genuinely pursue fulfilling their moral obligations to the global poor. The bourgeois adapt themselves to the world, and when enough of them do, they adapt the world to themselves by preventing equalizing progress. Interestingly, the middle class turns to nationalism/sexism/racism/intersectionality from either end, both pushing for a fascism because they both aim to avoid class reductionism (people clearly aren't being honest about what it means for capitalist to warp their their morally arbitrary characteristics, including over-elevating the value of parts of their identities as misdirection), the fundamental problem of capitalism. At best, idpol only seeks to reform capitalism, not replace it. Ultimately, I have little sympathy for most people who consider themselves [[pleft]]ists but don't actually take someone like Jesus' words seriously; that's just egoism (no different than the capitalist in intention, and it means you are a reactionary). Some questions only have one right answer, one external to each of us, and if you can't accept that: you are the problem. There is no silent [[pleft]] majority being suppressed; there aren't really that many [[pleft]]ists (though plenty of LARPers).

If it were necessary for achieving the goal, we should all be willing to give up financial [[privacy]] and alternative currencies to ensure fair taxation and material equality. It appears that may be necessary.

It's not obvious that the DNC has much desire (given their real goals) to eliminate legislative obstruction like the filibuster.

One can maliciously ask stupid, clever, and rhetorical questions. We are not morally permitted to ask or answer questions in all contexts, even if we have a moral right to a political right otherwise. Obviously, there comes a point where you shouldn't be proud that you don't know, Socrates, especially if you didn't try to find the answer.

Lumpenreactionaries deny that younger generations are forced to strictly follow opportunity (alienating and otherwise) instead of a fair share of their dreams if they are to improve their odds of escaping becoming trapped, ambitionless husks who know they serve a false purpose to the point they deny there is a purpose.

I meditate in no small part to learn how to cope with myself. I'm still not the sort that gets bored if I am left to my own devices (even to just live in my head), and I think it's important for me to try to experience it without wasting my time. Meditation helps some with that.

In practice, most fundamentalists of consequentialism wield it as a fallacious, circular shield against intersubjectively discovering increasingly accurate approximations of the objective contents of The Moral law.
