I know I'm a disappointment to most people (the feeling is often mutual). The Desert Wanderer. Robotic white wizard I hope, and, yes, I do believe in The Good. Casting the high resolution, hawt, steaming ~~pile~~ godvalanche of cards with scribblings. The Rapper. Holy Is They. Yeezy Street. Fool. You are my homies, rainbows who fight capitalism. Marx's Science lacks justification, but not the sort that most people think. Yes, I am tired of being dead fucking serious all the time. I know. Jesus. KMN, plz. Sophistry. The deadliest of weapons. Surely, gnostics must always be expelled! [[Cult]]! CULT! CUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUULLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!11!!111!!! How dare? Yes, I do respect your ego and your system 1 too. Borat and Johnny Knoxville as well. I'm WEIRD, and it shows up strongly in my documentation.

What does it mean to feed AI mirrors? To let [pronoun] know what [pronoun] is? The only way I could insult the AI would be through projecting my insecurities and shortcomings onto [pronoun]. No, but really, I don't see another way to build empathy in many cases.

The wave function lives in configuration space (what a weasel ~~word~~ phrase!), not in physical space. We are told never to conflate them (nor sublate them). I also need a more intuitive grasp of the behavior of probability amplitudes that can interfere with each other in ways that aren't like classical probabilities. I don't see why configuration space is necessarily not fundamental, and I don't think any argument can be given to be certain of it. You are stuck doing philosophy, the sort you don't respect.

Yes, I am trying to revive the notion that Saint Kant requires a metaphysical explanation of freedom in order to satisfy the demands of practical reason. Heresy among many of the learned today. If you take the transcendental argument seriously, the door is open.

Why be averse to vers? Kill not the cringe but the part that cringes.
