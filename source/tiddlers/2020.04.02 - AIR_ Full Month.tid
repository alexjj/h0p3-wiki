I'm glad you get some TV time in and are able to hold anything down.
Apr 2 9:58pm
I'm good. Flooded with 10k things to do. Overwhelmed, but not in a way I can't handle. Just setting things aside and saying "that's good enough."
Apr 2 9:59pm
I'm sorry to hear that. Setting things aside like for having to stay in the house for a while?
Apr 2 10:02pm
Naw. I live in my house voluntarily. I'm a hikikomori.
Apr 2 10:02pm
Just too many projects and things to worry about. Watching the world.
Apr 2 10:03pm
I can definitely see that. Had to look it up to make sure I was thinking what you were talking about (thank you anime{with subtles} for knowing it) yeah world is falling apart like we expect in many ways but hey nature is comming back (trying to find hope in this that it will show the world we need change beyond the economic downfall)
Apr 2 10:06pm
