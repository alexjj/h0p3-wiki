title: 2020.09.24 - Prompted Introspection: Colorful DNA

!! What color do you feel like today?

I've answered a similar question before: [[2018.03.23 - Prompted Introspection Log: Color of Self-Being]], [[2019.12.07 - Prompted Introspection: Colors of Happiness]]. XD. While not thoroughly explored, color is an important topic for me; it runs into the DNA of this [[ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱]]. 

<$button class="tc-btn-invisible" popup=<<qualify "$:/temp/PI-Color">>>

Contextlink: [search[color]]
</$button>
<$reveal type="nomatch" state=<<qualify "$:/temp/PI-Color">> text="">

<$list filter="[search[color]] +[sort[title]]" emptyMessage="">
<$link to={{!!title}}><$view field="title"/></$link>
<$context length=80 term="Color"/>
<$context length=80 term="TERM2"/>
<br>
</$list>

</$reveal>

I have no idea. Maybe all of them. {{Text Art: 𝕱𝕴𝕽𝕰🔥}}. Rainbows are expensive, and I've not even earned my imaginary stripes. Mmm. I also feel transparent and mirroring sometimes too. I feel like I'm bouldering the torrent of colors too. Surely, I am too old to have not figured this out.
