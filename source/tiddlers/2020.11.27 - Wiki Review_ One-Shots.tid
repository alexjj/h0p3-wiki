title: 2020.11.27 - Wiki Review: One-Shots

* [[2020.11.26 - Prompted Introspection: My Lacking]]
** Completed. I've gotten a string of [[prompts]] that are one-shots lately. I'm glad to have them. I think they add plenty of color to an otherwise monotonous march.

** Completed. Will the space between Biden's coronation and now be used to empty people out of their houses? They could blame it on Trump. My prediction years ago was that he'd be scapegoated, and this seems like an opportunity for the wealthy to continue to press the attack.

** I grow quieter with almost everyone I think. Curl-up, regroup. I hope to oscillate back. It's easier reaching out to strangers in a way; we both will tend to have more reasons to grow [[intimate]]. Often, I am caught in a loop of polite redundancy. I am not so convinced that time is the missing ingredient (I have enough experience and failures to think otherwise).
