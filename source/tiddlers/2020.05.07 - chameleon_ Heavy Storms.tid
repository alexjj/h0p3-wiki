title: 2020.05.07 - chameleon: Heavy Storms

"""
[10:29 PM] h0p3: You doing alright?
[10:36 PM] chameleon: just about
[10:36 PM] chameleon: heavy storms here
[10:36 PM] h0p3: Aye.
[10:36 PM] chameleon: yesterday it shut the power off for 12 hours. mags and I were reduced to reading by candlelight
[10:36 PM] h0p3: =/
[10:36 PM] chameleon: (mags is the abyssal)
[10:38 PM] h0p3: We lost it many times in Johnson City. It was less common New Orleans (but still occurred).
[10:38 PM] h0p3: Living out in the boonies can make it take much longer.

[5:05 AM] chameleon: https://philosopher.life/#Fallacies
ahhh, but have you considered


the fallacy fallacy
//[sound of fedoras angrily being ripped in half]//
[5:05 AM] chameleon: I was thinking about it today
[5:07 AM] chameleon: the example I had in mind was:

Alice: Einstein said the sky was blue, therefore the sky is blue.
Bob: Aha! That's an argument from authority, a logical fallacy! Therefore, the sky is red.

[12:00 AM] h0p3: Shit. I missed your message.
[12:01 AM] h0p3: Fallacy fallacy came up during my daughter's presentation.
[12:03 AM] h0p3: Your example seems good to me. Usually, it will be couched as, "Therefore, it is not the case the sky is blue." It's denying the antecedent, mistakenly treating the conditional like a biconditional.
[12:04 AM] h0p3: P ->Q, ~P âˆ´ ~Q
[12:08 AM] chameleon: I thought I was being sophistic and annoyed you :stuck_out_tongue:
[12:08 AM] h0p3: lol!
[12:09 AM] h0p3: I don't know what's up with Discord notifications on my computer. They are not consistent. They should stay up until I touch my keyboard.
[12:10 AM] chameleon: http://existentialcomics.com/comic/9
[12:10 AM] chameleon: this one's pretty funny too
[12:11 AM] chameleon: I'm glad people are aware of logical fallacies, but people often misunderstand them too
[12:11 AM] h0p3: Agreed. I am unhappy with the way the topic is handled in a lot of circles.
[12:14 AM] h0p3: Justification is the foundational problem in epistemology, and fallacies alone cannot negatively define it. Even the core fallacies can't stand on their own.
[12:15 AM] h0p3: This comic author is my hero or something.
[12:17 AM] h0p3: Even in the comic, Fallacy Man is justifiably subject to an ad hominem criticism. Like, it's good reasoning to attack his identity in this respect.
[12:21 AM] h0p3: All good on the electricity front?
[12:21 AM] chameleon: yup
[12:21 AM] chameleon: brief blip during a second storm
[12:21 AM] chameleon: but it hasn't gone off again
[12:21 AM] h0p3: I looked for that article for the freezer, but couldn't find it.
[12:22 AM] h0p3: We lost power for a couple weeks in New Orleans after a hurricane. Ended up losing a lot of groceries. =/.
[12:25 AM] chameleon: ah jeeze
[12:25 AM] chameleon: that sounds crazy
[12:25 AM] chameleon: we were lucky, the fridge lasted
[12:25 AM] chameleon: it kept the cold
[12:25 AM] chameleon: but we might not be so lucky next time, hence thinking about getting an off-grid one
[12:26 AM] h0p3: I hear ya. I've been checkin around a bit. My brother [[JRE]] (JRE) is an electrician. Solar is still pricey, even without labor.
