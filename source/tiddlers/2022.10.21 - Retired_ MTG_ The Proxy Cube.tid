//Optimize. If we are going to waste our time, at least don't waste money (more time :P). We're shooting for ~500 or ~650 standalone first-picks only (we'll see what that means for glue, ramp, CQ, smoothing, etc.) in a format we have reason to believe will be control heavy and artifact dominant. I suppose this a nash ranking of singleton draft [[power]]. In my experience, combos get stalemated through priority hoarding, and I'm not a fan of building a game in virtue of critical luck. Note that, at least for now, we draft the entire cube regardless of the number of players: it causes us to judge the entire pool every draft. We still have other standard mechanisms to question, e.g. 40 or 60 cards? [[âˆ°]] might be an addition worth exploring. Presumably, it must evolve quite a bit (surely, we will spiral-learn all the lessons of [[MTG]] all over again), but I have [[hope]] that we can find the [[salient]] format and metagame within 50 cards. Every family has them "secret" recipes, right? This would be a dope family recipe. Gonna try to rank 'em here; let's make it rain. Maybe we need a voting procedure.//
