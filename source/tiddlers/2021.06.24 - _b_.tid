no THe ONuS is On u. So share the research that supports your view, even though I'm not going to put my skin in the game. No, I won't defend this assertion either (and it's not hypocritical for a reason I don't have to give you), at least not until you defend yours. Obviously, your argument is in bad [[faith]] because you aren't trying to be persuasive to those who aren't curiously charitable and can't be bothered to pull their own weight in the dialectic. This just isn't fun to me, so make it fun or I won't play. And, how dare you expect me to work to understand anything! It is always your responsibility to provide the arbitrary signals I need to feel comfortable and to conveniently guess what I think is your epistemic authority confidence interval. XD. Lawd. Let's talk about justification, warrant, and evidence; epistemology ought not be conceptually divorced from morality (that would be wrong or bad reason). Your move. Go.

One of my favorite parts of my [[Root Users]] is that they give me permission to fail.

It is no spectre: The Spectacle of capitalism is the set of emerging illusions from signaling processes which absorb change simply to commodify all human endeavor. That is a performativity I'm worried about.

Old facts that bear repeating: whoever thinks cryptocurrencies are non-debaseable in virtue of their mining algorithm haven't looked at who owns the assets spread across The Stack. That you politically own it is still based on a few illusions (though I agree you own to a different [[dok]] than other kinds of currencies). I cannot build a private one that cannot be destroyed either. Only absolute decentralization can defeat fiat, nation-state actor military aggression (and, if I'm in the MIC, I'm studying how to attack these networks...likely already possessing significant answers from the beginning). Cryptocurrency is incapable of solving the problem of political [[power]] centralization without having fundamentally decentralized its computation across the planet, including radical redistribution of wealth. Flaky cryptocurrencies do not save you in armageddon, and none of them are designed to prevent it either (though, I agree digital currency plays a role in the solution).

Nobody seems to be able to define CRT well enough (with plenty of No True Scotsman to go around), so I'll pick out some membranes that matter. Insofar as CRT's approach to legal scholarship is working from the assumption of pervasive racial inequality at a global scale, particularly as a type, flavor, and crucial function of classism, it's correct. Insofar as CRT is an offshoot of intersectionality that promotes misdirecting our focus from class to idpol, as though racism, be it domination or ideology, is the central priority political problem, it's mistaken (that would be another vein of reactionary reasoning). Insofar as CRT uncritically embraces anti-essentialism and materialist constructionism (the denial of which is hardly the claim that constructions do not obtain or are somehow irrelevant), it's yet another postmodern failure that deconstructs itself (I find most have people have no idea what they've committed themselves to in formal philosophy, and I'm disappointed to find they don't want to know). Insofar as CRT fails to recognize the necessity of the labeling of [[the other]], it cannot speak intelligibly about normativity. Insofar as CRT is critical of dominant historical legal claims to neutrality, objectivity, fairness, and justice without denying the necessity of intersubjectively exploring philosophic abstractions and generalizations about these concepts (including understanding race as a morally arbitrary characteristic that we've failed to treat as such throughout history), it's doing good work. Insofar as CRT agrees that the problem of racism is necessary but insufficient for describing the immorality of the history of political [[power]], it's correct; but, insofar as CRT would claim looking through the lens of race is necessary for describing the concept of immoral political [[power]], it would be wrong. Insofar as CRT acknowledges the dignity of the essence of the good of all persons (wisely wielded metaethical autonomy, goodwill itself), including their qualia and the knowledge that can only have been acquired through experiencing marginalization, claiming that justice cannot obtain without taking each person's perspective into account, it is golden-rule-oriented, and fundamentally concerned with The Moral Law in practice. Insofar as CRT aims to challenge the possibility of any fair hierarchy of [[power]], epistemic or ontological, it is incoherent. Even a minimally charitable, barely steelpersoned position of CRT can meet all the conditions here, and I suggest most obviously do.

Insofar as emotions are messengers that are not up to us, we should radically accept that they exist (in our [[phenomenology]]) without overextending into the claim they should exist. Those are two different kinds of assent or acceptance. Emotions aren't mere messengers, but we aren't slaves to them either.

With each passing day, as a wizard, more and more of the runes of mystery are deciphered, uncovered, and revealed to me. My retardations grow along bright arcane lines. Surely, my apotheosis will soon be complete, my awakening will bring about the one true essential imago of logos of the thing-in-itself. Prepare to tremble before me, normies. `/burp`.
