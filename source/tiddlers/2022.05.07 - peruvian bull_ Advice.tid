"""
Hey there. I'm looking for your advice on what you think people who live only slightly better than hand-to-mouth should do with what little they have given whatever the heck is happening in the world. For reference, https://philosopher.life/#Unorthodox%20Savings.
Don't call it financial advice. Hypotheticalize it. Whatever. I want to know what you think, please.

Where do you live? (Generally)
And do you have debt/liabilities?

The advice I'm looking for isn't just for me. I'm looking for advice for people who aren't even as well situated as myself.
We live in CT, US. We have a mortgage acquired almost 2 years ago, a used car loan, and soon enough a large debt to install solar panels on our house, all of them at what I consider very low rates. My wife's job is a fairly secure one, imho (at an institution older than the US government itself). The debts are something we will be able to pay given her salary (and we took them on given the assumption of radical inflation).
I've read through your entire account btw, and your Twitter. If you have more you think is worth reading, I would read it. You're a person I've followed from afar (and accidentally at first) for a while now. I appreciate your taking the time to speak with me.

Of course! Always happy to offer advice
We are going to be in a short lull period of inflation until the Fed restarts QE. So inflation will stabilize at 8% for the next few months
I would say it's a good idea to have a small rainy day fund that can cover a few months of expenses
In terms of investments, I'm going for BTC, gold, GME, and a few commodity plays. Been thinking about buying farmland as well
It's a Good idea to stock up on food as well

`/nod`. I appreciate the advice, sir. Thank you.

Of course
What is that website by the way?
Looks like notes for a plethora of items
Really interesting.. you have an intellectually gifted daughter?

That is my ball of text in a single html file. I have no idea how to describe it well enough. It definitely contains plenty of notes and more. It's huge. Maybe 80 novels worth of text in it. Kinda like uploading parts of my mind into it, a journal, a social media device all-in-one.
I do have a fairly gifted daughter. I used to teach at Tulane, and she would come to class with me, and if the students couldn't answer the question, she did.
She keeps her own wiki as well. Whole family does.
I highly recommend tools like Tiddlywiki for academics, btw.
I've spent a lot of time thinking about decentralization (mined some of the original bitcoin, way back). It might be a worthy topic for us to consider.

Very interesting. I might check out how to make my own, a place to organize my thoughts
Raising gifted children comes with its own set of challenges. It's amazing that you're actively thinking about how to do it best
My dad is absolutely brilliant but was born into a very close-minded Mormon family in Utah. It took quite a toll on him and stunted him intellectually because they didn't want him to take any physics or math courses and instead go for seminary School
I've been investigating the world of Defi for the past few months now, it's an absolutely fascinating space
It's a lot harder to learn about than traditional Fields because it's just so avant garde

https://tiddlywiki.com, https://obsidian.md/, or even a text editor with good naming conventions with file search tooling goes a long way.
I agree that raising gifted children poses its own set of challenges. I cannot say I do it well enough.
I have a lot in common with your dad on those points.
What has become of him?
I assume he didn't do the same with you.
There's a lot of noise, hype, and untrustworthy shilling in the DeFi space that compounds that difficulty of understanding an intersection of problems, some of them quite new to us.
What are some of your favorite aspects of DeFi?
Do you have any concerns about BTC?

No, my parents were extremely laissez faire with me; they essentially treated me as an adult once i turned 12. I was fortunate to be raised in an intellectually stimulating environment, and got to debate and discuss concepts from a very early age. they also pushed me to go into private school, and all honors/AP classes (which i hated at the time but were generally useful)
Defi is a pretty large and complex space, there's so much cool stuff going on. I'm currently lending on Aave and liquid staking on Lido; trying to expand out and try out more dapps and smart contracts, just to understand how they work
I'm not a software engineer, but incidentally my education in monetary economics is pretty helpful
The concern i do have with BTC is locking of fiat on/off ramps. Bitcoins' blockchain is basically immutable and extremely hard to hack, but theoretically the govt and banks could shut down most if not all ways of transferring BTC into fiat
although by this point enough wealthy people and special interests are in the space that i don't think that will happen

It's good to hear that they may have prized your autonomy so much.
If and when it occurs, do you think you'll end up doing the same with your own?
Aave looks like it's been going through significant changes in the past few years.
It's an interesting idea.
Blockchain liquidity is not an easy problem. It's hard to build high velocity capable networks.
I'm a huge fan of dApps. Hard to find many that are in use at scale.
I can imagine your education has been exceptionally useful in navigating this space.
I'll be interested to see if you come up with any other concerns with BTC over time. You pick a crucial problem out. What do you think about governments' perspectives on stablecoins?
This is another odd question, but I've maybe been sniffing out a trail of a problem with passive investment. Do you have any concerns with ETFs, index funds, etc.? If you want, I'll pick out a piece of gibberish on the topic for ya, but I'm happy just to hear your feelings and thoughts on it.

With regards to raising intelligent kids- I think that allowing them to be a bit autonomous is useful, but structure and rules still have their place. Growing up my parents essentially didn't give me much structure so I developed some pretty poor eating and sleeping habits which gave me some health conditions later on in life. It would have been nice to have a little bit more discipline, and I think I would have accepted it especially if my parents had explained why they were doing what they were doing
As long as you can rationally explain why a rule exists to a kid, unless they're a complete rebel, I'm sure they will follow suit
To be fair most of my issues are my fault- I just think they were exhausted of raising kids at that point (4 brothers) and my dad has some mental health issues and so that exacerbated the problems
Long term with Bitcoin there could be issues of centralization with mining pools, people could attempt a hash power attack on the network. Altho the sheer cost of doing that, and the energy included would discourage it
I need to do more research on stable coins to be honest I know that they put out a bunch of theoretical regulations but it sounds like there are overall willing and able to accept stable coins
Yeah passive investing is a massive issue
It contributes to bubbles and it's centralizes power in the hands of fewer and fewer financial intermediaries

Preach, yo

If everyone passively invests into vanguard ETFs, then vanguard becomes a massive shareholder in every corporation and can effectively push markets around
Passive investors don't care about the inner workings of a company, and I get that but by handing the money to wealthy and entrenched elite interests they give more power to those who likely should not hold it

Did you have to move around a lot as a young person?
I appreciate how empathetic you are to your father's circumstances. That's gracious of you.
Are your brothers happy? Are they smart like you and your father? What do they think of your understanding of the world?
I could imagine your father would have lots of mental health concerns after an upbringing like his.
Do you think we should have any concerns with Bitcoin's impact on the environment? How about its number of transactions per day?

No I didn't move around at all, which was great benefit for me as I was able to maintain some sort of stability. I have a lot of sympathy for my dad as he is a brilliant person but unfortunately cursed with some pretty bad chronic depression was just makes his life hard.

`/nod`

For example my brother number three was in the applied mathematics department at University at 18 years old. One time I remember I was in an AP physics course and we had to do an integral calculus problem with five variables, my dad and I will both working through it but we were having a hard time with it, he randomly called me and we were chatting, he asked what we were up to and I told him we were stuck on a problem. He asked me to read it out and I did and he solved the whole thing within 30 seconds
In his head
He's absolutely brilliant but the sad thing is he's cursed with this mental affliction that has basically prevented him from ever really being able to hold a steady job or be successful financially

That reminds me of my Uncle (in-law) [[Charlie]]. He's kinda an idiot savant. Very beautiful person.
Similar problems for my uncle.

My brother is one of the kindest and sweetest people we've ever met and he's been through more suffering than almost anyone else I know. .

Has been homeless before?

Most likely but we would have never known... He traveled to Peru, my mother's country of origin, when I was around 5 years old and stayed there until I was about 19. My parents had the periodically go down there and bail him out of jail or get him out of the mental hospital.
I know he was surviving on very little down there
He was paranoid so he would never tell us his whereabouts or what he was up to and would constantly change his phone numbers

Sounds like yall have been through some hell.

Yeah, very true. My whole family has. But it's been good in many ways.
Anyways, long story short I think Intelligent people have a higher incidence of neuroticism, so more susceptible to depression/loneliness/anxiety/ anti social behavior

A fair claim.

That would be a good thing to watch out for

Indeed. Thank you.

Make sure she knows she's supported and has someone to talk to. Absolutely
What do you teach? You mentioned Tulane

Yes, sir. We work hard for that.
I taught philosophy there. I've taught music and language arts as well in public schools.

That's amazing! I love philosophy
I think most teachers teach it incorrectly

How do they do it? How should it be taught instead?

A lot of them make half minded assertions, reference obscure and useless theories, and bake political opinions into everything they say. They approach it from an absolute standpoint, not a relative one. Many theories, especially moral ones, can be debated endlessly, and the professors i had did not allow for that
They never covered great philosophers such as Marcus Aurelius and epictetus
I don't want it to be an echo chamber of either the right or left- it should be a healthy discussion of ideas and presuppositions that underlie them

Thank you for telling. I can appreciate that point of view.

What do you think of the field

I'm an analytic philosopher with some background in continental. I have mixed feelings about what academia has become. I think it has been largely hollowed out by the interests of the wealthy.
There was a huge difference in the quality of teachers and peers between the various schools I've attended.
I'm very [[lucky]] to have been able to receive the education I did.
I think systematic philosophy is not encouraged enough.
The incentives and competition are perverse. Hundreds of applications for any opening as a student or a teacher.
I don't think most of the people who studied the topic put their money where their mouth was, didn't have their skin in the game, didn't practice what they preached, and it was largely just a game to them.
Still, extremely interesting people. I learned a lot.
