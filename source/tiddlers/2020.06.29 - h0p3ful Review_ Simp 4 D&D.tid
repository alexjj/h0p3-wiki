** I think you would be strong in this game. You must practice your deception skills. You lie often enough to me, but I am exceptionally easy to lie to in many respects.

** I hope you will inspect those carefully. Your dad has an overly narrow perspective all too often. Loot them all for everything they are worth. Figure out what you want to make. Figure out how to be lazy [[irwartfrr]]. Make art that you enjoy, and keep throwing shit at the wall.

** A fine answer. You'd be surprised to see the sociological/psychological implications of how people answer this question for themselves.
** It will be valuable for you to recognize that the STEMlords and Humeans will continue to attack freewill, and you've got a difficult defense to mount.

** I doubt that fixing humans would fix everything. It's a tall task, of course. Even just fixing ourselves as individuals is this monumentally impossible (at some point) thing.
