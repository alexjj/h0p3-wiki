!! What's something you'd like to touch?

I'm going to embrace the reformed question in [[2020.01.27 - Prompted Introspection: Touch]]. Yeah, I'm happy to bask in the figurative metaphor answers, but I'd like to push further in the material world here. There's plenty of the cool sciencey kids toys and substances to name here, and there's also lots of indirect things (in virtue of holding them I'd have accomplished another goal most likely). I've been thinking about tactility a bit more lately. Even for someone who often prefers to live in his head, there's something grounding about touch. I enjoy the fulfilling feel of my beads, the feel of running water, satisfying ''skinhunger'', the comfort of my sensitive vertical mouse, petting the cats, breathable cloth, and stainless steel.

Oddly enough, while watching social distancing practices, I realized that I would like to touch the Kaaba black stone. Megiddo, Gethsemane, and places I've only read about too. Hell, there are lot of different temples I'd like to touch in the world. That was an interesting part of Thailand. That said, I'd want it to be cheap and take as little time as possible. I needs me a teleporter.
