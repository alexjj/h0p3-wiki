title: 2021.03.10 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Simple

Enjoyed the remainder of the Salvia experience, then to sleep at 1:30.

Woke at 6:30. Fast. Too fast. Anxiety, but it's okay. Annoyed my wife with affection. Finna buss one out, but a possible promise grunt (with a rang on it and everything, so I will dutifully wait as long as I can). I was asked to not ruin my offspring's mornings, of course. You people: do you think this is a motherfuckin game to me?

[[TTTOTW]]. Work on Mark-V, feeling productive today (okay, maybe Salvia did do something, wat; an argument for ketamine, perhaps [do feel a bit clearer in a way). Talking with [[K]] and [[AA]], briefly. Cantopeners.

Hugs'n'bugs. Dialectures for each. You are welcome. 

Laundry, cleaning, organizing.

Played some magic with both my offspring today. Why exercise when we can avoid it?

Skintime, Chatter, Inform the Men! Thank you. Shower of the gods! 

[[Family Gathering]], but Scout was asleep. Pierogies, salad. Offspring played magic, adults chilled. I burnt hers (didn't look burned, but they tasted it a bit - my bet is the oil), =/. Fek. 

[[TTTOTW]], Fireman Time!

Cube drafted. My daughter's got the best card pool, by far. I'm not helping her build her deck any further than I have: I need to win. I'm being asked how to draft (which is not my forte, though I've won plenty). It's difficult to communicate all the features that go into the feelings I have for each card. They aren't intangibles, but there's a flood of details that make it difficult to prioritize and summarize. And, this is just a stupid fucking game. Practice. And, of course, my argument is the same in [[ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱]]ing with each [[other]] (which, again, is not my strong suite).
