[14:16:42] [[esinpe]]: Hi
[14:20:35] [[esinpe]]: Okay, the thing is, using talcum powder is optional.
[14:21:02] [[esinpe]]: It's upto the choice of the person. The internet is full of mean stuff about it.
[14:28:50] [[esinpe]]: Okay, I'm off to bed now. Have a good day!
[19:07:57] [[h0p3]]: Our skincare routine: wash with Cetaphil for sensitive skin; apply witch hazel and let dry; apply azelaic acid and let dry; apply water-based moisturizer. Done!
[19:08:18] [[h0p3]]: Talcum powder may not be a great idea, `/nod`. 
[19:08:25] [[h0p3]]: Sleep well, sir.
[22:52:04] [[esinpe]]: Nice. It's a nice routine.

[00:41:56] [[esinpe]]: Hi
[00:50:31] [[esinpe]]: I've got a good news for you.
[00:50:49] [[esinpe]]: I can listen to stuff at 100% capacity in my right ear now!
[00:51:04] [[esinpe]]: No more tinnitus, no more irritation, etc.
[00:51:16] [[esinpe]]: My voice feels different too!
[00:56:38] [[h0p3]]: Noice =)
[02:38:21] [[esinpe]]: Yo
[02:38:23] [[esinpe]]: Sup?
[02:38:48] [[h0p3]]: Not much. [[TTTOTW]] and watching //Videodrome// (no idea what it is, yet)
[02:38:50] [[h0p3]]: How about you?
[02:41:32] [[esinpe]]: I just showered.
[02:42:01] [[esinpe]]: I could hear the water flowing out to the drain!
[02:43:03] [[h0p3]]: Neat.
[02:43:22] [[h0p3]]: We do as well down here. Piping system is right above us. 
[02:46:02] [[esinpe]]: Oh, I didn't mean it like that. I meant the water on the floor, when it starts entering the drainage pipe, it makes a noise. Happens in the sink too. It had been months since I heard that noise.
[02:46:42] [[esinpe]]: I had gotten so used to my inability to hear things in my right ear that this whole thing feels so different.
[02:48:29] [[h0p3]]: That makes sense. Cool.
[02:50:44] [[esinpe]]: So.. got an idea of what videodrome is?
[02:50:56] [[h0p3]]: Nope.
[02:50:59] [[h0p3]]: Lol.
[02:51:06] [[esinpe]]: Haha
[02:51:32] [[esinpe]]: Do you know how to play an instrument?
[02:51:51] [[h0p3]]: Aye, though I've not played anything seriously in a long time.
[02:52:00] [[h0p3]]: You play music?
[02:52:02] [[esinpe]]: Nice, which all do you know?
[02:52:06] [[esinpe]]: Nope, I don't.
[02:52:26] [[h0p3]]: Piano, clarinet, guitar, and banjo.
[02:52:38] [[esinpe]]: Whoa, those are a lot.
[02:52:55] [[h0p3]]: I started when I was 9.
[02:53:02] [[esinpe]]: Damn...
[02:53:11] [[esinpe]]: Which one did you begin with?
[02:53:44] [[h0p3]]: Piano. 
[02:54:08] [[esinpe]]: Cool!
[02:54:34] [[h0p3]]: I was alright at it. Was paid to play, and I also taught. Got to play in college too. I'm a fan of Rachmaninoff. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCtixpIWBto
[02:55:30] [[esinpe]]: What is that?
[02:55:34] [[h0p3]]: My opinion is that it was largely a waste of time beyond the first two years, which did shape my brain.
[02:55:41] [[h0p3]]: That's one of the pieces I used to play.
[02:55:58] [[esinpe]]: Bruh, you were paid to play! You weren't alright, you were amazing at it!
[02:56:13] [[h0p3]]: Naw. I was just alright. I've met amazing. 
[02:56:24] [[esinpe]]: >My opinion is that it was largely a waste of time beyond the first two years, which did shape my brain.

[02:56:26] [[esinpe]]: Oh..
[02:56:35] [[esinpe]]: >Naw. I was just alright. I've met amazing. 

Damn,
[02:59:22] [[h0p3]]: What you up to today?
[02:59:52] [[esinpe]]: Nothing much. Just watching YouTube videos on weird stuff, studying, etc.
[03:00:06] [[h0p3]]: `/nod`. The usual grind.
[03:00:12] [[esinpe]]: Yeah...
[03:01:23] [[esinpe]]: I created a new reddit account.
[03:01:42] [[h0p3]]: :P
[03:01:52] [[esinpe]]: So I have 3 now!
[03:02:05] [[esinpe]]: 3 Active accounts!
[03:02:50] [[esinpe]]: From now on, instead of calling me Variety-Creepy or Competitive_Fudge, call me esinpe.
[03:03:13] [[esinpe]]: It's 'esinpe', not esnipe. The i before the n.
[03:03:50] [[h0p3]]: May it be a huge account.
[03:03:56] [[esinpe]]: Thanks.
[03:04:27] [[esinpe]]: I thinking of making it my internet name. You know, like how Cristopher Poole has moot, you have h0p3..
[03:04:49] [[h0p3]]: Hehe. Aye. 
[09:59:52] [[esinpe]]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYYXfLdpuds

Yo!
[09:59:52] [[esinpe]]: You have to watch this fight
[09:59:52] [[esinpe]]: It is legit amazing.
[10:00:00] [[esinpe]]: Goku and Frieza fighting together.
[10:00:10] [[esinpe]]: You don't see something like this everyday.
[10:00:32] [[esinpe]]: The first time I saw this, I just lost it. Damn... this show is fucking awesome.
[10:00:59] [[esinpe]]: And Goku flickering out of Super Saiyan is even more cool. 
[10:01:34] [[esinpe]]: You have to watch it, sir. 
[10:01:41] [[esinpe]]: Let me know when you're done.
[11:13:32] [[esinpe]]: Hey
[11:13:32] [[esinpe]]: Are you online?
[11:13:48] [[esinpe]]: I wanna talk something important.
[11:20:09] [[esinpe]]: Dude
[11:21:33] [[esinpe]]: I would like some help.
[pending] [[h0p3]]: I just got up, homie. I'm online now.
[pending] [[h0p3]]: What's up?
[pending] [[h0p3]]: I watched the vidya. Thank you for the link.
