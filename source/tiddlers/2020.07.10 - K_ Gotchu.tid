"""
[1:10 PM] [[h0p3]]: Checking in: I am fine.
[1:11 PM] [[h0p3]]: Storms coming, so those tents+tarps are going to get tested.
[1:14 PM] [[K]]: Are you all camping?
[1:14 PM] [[h0p3]]: Eventually
[1:14 PM] [[K]]: I hope they can weather the storm. :heart:
[1:14 PM] [[h0p3]]: me too
[1:15 PM] [[K]]: It's been a pretty shitty week. Hoping the next one will be better.
[1:15 PM] [[h0p3]]: What made it shitty?
[1:15 PM] [[K]]: Sleep has been wonderful though. Trade offs I guess.
[1:16 PM] [[K]]: A combination of brain goblins and drama concerning my campaign.
[1:17 PM] [[K]]: Just wanna go back to bed haha

[1:20 PM] [[K]]: hello!
[1:20 PM] [[K]]: I spent way too much money at Kroger. :face_vomiting:
[1:20 PM] [[h0p3]]: Sorry, breh.
[1:21 PM] [[K]]: It's a necessary evil haha
[1:21 PM] [[h0p3]]: True dat. Anything stand out in your haul today?
[1:21 PM] [[K]]: Ladyfingers are surprisingly hard to acquire and they're hard to find in a store too.
[1:22 PM] [[K]]: :hand_splayed:
[1:22 PM] [[h0p3]]: Dope.
[1:22 PM] [[K]]: Gonna learn how to make tiramasu Friday :slight_smile:
[1:24 PM] [[h0p3]]: I've only been able to have that a few times in my life. That dessert is amazing.
[1:24 PM] [[K]]: When we can eventually come visit, I gotchu.
[1:24 PM] [[K]]: Ya know when the pandemic is over for the US in ten years. :slight_smile:
[1:24 PM] [[K]]: the rest of the world will be fine by the end of 2021 haha
[1:26 PM] [[h0p3]]: It may become illegal to traverse into my state without a 14-day quarantine (have to pay a fine if you get caught).
[1:27 PM] [[K]]:
[1:27 PM] [[h0p3]]: Lol.
[1:27 PM] [[h0p3]]: Sadly, I do not think the rest of the world will be fine even if CV19 has been handled. My hyperreading has been grim AF.
[1:28 PM] [[h0p3]]: CV19 is an accelerant.
[1:29 PM] [[h0p3]]: I need tiramisu now, lol.
