title: 2021.12.08 - Prompted Introspection: Speaking With The Dead

!! If you could have a conversation with a loved one who has passed away, what would you ask them?

I've answered a question like this before: [[2020.03.19 - Prompted Introspection: Nana]], though I prefer the way this is phrased (keeping). So, it's time to dig back deep into this ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱, back to the initial page: [[2016.10.17 - Letter to Mom and Dad]]. I'd like to speak with [[Betty Boop]], or, as I know this woman, Grandma Bubbles (as opposed to Nana and Grandma French Fries). 

I'd like to know more about your immigration, how you dropped everything to take care of your siblings (becoming their parents, and what happened to yours again?), how you feel about your sociopathic son and what his upbringing was like, what you saw in my great grandfather, what it was like dancing on tables for drinks (what was the nastiest thang you err did, grill?), what you'd say to the girl who killed you, what you thought about taking in your granddaughter after her emancipation, what you thought about your granddaughter's family, if you really decided to quit smoking because it made me sick, how much vodka you actually put in those martinis, why you wouldn't do anything except boil those brats, why you watched soaps and played cards instead of thinking about the world, what your religious and philosophical perspective was, and whether or not that dog really deserved to live. Looking back now, after death, what do you think of your life and your large number of sociopaths in your family? You seemed somewhat different, but I can't put my finger on it. What was it? Am I wrong about you too?
