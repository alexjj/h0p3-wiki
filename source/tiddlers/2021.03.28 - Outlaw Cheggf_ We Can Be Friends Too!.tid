title: 2021.03.28 - Outlaw Cheggf: We Can Be Friends Too!

//[[TLDR]]: Why, of course I sense your cry for attention!<<ref "g">> Come here, darling, and let's think about the most autistic thing you've ever encountered in your entire life. I'm sorry you felt [[left out|https://www.reddit.com/r/greentext/comments/mehyi9/anon_talks_himself_into_trouble/gsjzmeh/?context=3]]. Let's [[remedy|Wiki Litmus Test]] that. Even on a prisoner's island, I'll try to speak your sterling retarded language as best I can,<<ref "sp">> and, in doing so, I ask for your forgiveness in advance for sounding like such a condescending faggot. Don't get sincerely butthurt as I make you my sounding board bitch, okay? Please do try to squeeze out more than a few copied words from your pretty homoerotic asshole that you call a mouth.<<ref "we">> Btw, as a delusional god-tier antagonist, I had a blast writing this for you. Truth hurts sometimes. Your immoral abuse of pseudonymity is deplorable, but you are fun to make fun of, so, no matter how pathetic, don't hold back any punches, aight?//

Dear Outlaw Cheggf,

It's an honor to meet you, [[nomad|Find The Others]]. Please let me know if I can [[help|Help]] [[you|Outlaw Cheggf]].<<ref "w">> In a few days, my sidebar will be functioning again, but I serve you a rare treat,<<ref "f">> honored guest, something most people have to find on their own: [[Hidden: Sidebar]].<<ref "i">> If you are foolish enough, [[download a copy of this wiki|Readme]], perhaps one day you'll be glad you did. You may find responding to me to be worth your time a decade from now when you grow up (golly gee) and overcome being a nihilistic pile of shit (don't worry, i gotchu fam). 

I know you aren't socially well-developed (and who is, really?). It's not easy to survive, let alone to thrive [[irwartfrr]]. I would know. I know how painful it is to interact with people in [[good]] [[faith]]. You go ahead and put your shields up.<<ref "ma">> You are going to need them with me, Picard. Here is what I think: like the rest of us, you need someone to listen to you, and I'm here to listen to you like no one has ever listened to you before (I'm not convinced anyone ever really has with you). Let's talk, lashing out like RADkids and all. We're here together, and we should make the best of it, eh?

I have been called [[The Great Warrior Come To Slay The 4chan Beast|Links: Man Wants To Fight 4chan On Deep Web]] by someone even more retarded than myself (and, lemme tellya, aint nobody gonna outretard me). It's unfathomable how far I'm willing to go to speak with people.<<ref "y">> I'm delusional, and I think we both are to some crucial extent (thank goodness, right?). So, have you come to begin the prophesied clownfiesta that no one will give a fuck about? Surely, //we// will give a fuck, right? I do. I'm here to wrestle with you, son.<<ref "m">> I'm here to wrestle with all of you with what little I have (it's about 3 inches long). Let's do it, [[Pussy]]. Let's put our skin in the game together. Let me show you what to do with your hate, Darth Fucktard. We don't have to be sociopaths with each other. It's a choice! We can do better, and we should.

I'm autistically dead fucking serious. Srsly. Gather [[the other]] [[children|2020.09.13 - Prompted Introspection: Like This One]], I'll be your temporary [[father|BAGD]] around the {{Text Art: ùï±ùï¥ùïΩùï∞üî•}}.<<ref "yd">> You clearly need one, dumbass (I [[love]] you, even when I don't [[like]] you). Shall I equip you to troll the world? Come hither, let us wisely practice kindness and the ways of The Joker together. Let us see what is worth fighting for, especially the butterflies and flowers, light as a feather. You have to actually be willing to sacrifice for [[intimacy]]. And, my god, you need a hug. I can see it. Wish I could be there right now to hug you. It's so expensive to [[share]] ourselves. Lawd. I'm glad we have a chance to think about our stories together. It's a unique opportunity: giving keys to the treasures of and within each of us to others is an existential task. 

Now, I've spoken with plenty of [[monster]]s in my life, including my own. So, bear with me as I try to make [[art]] from your evil. If it pleases your majesty, here is a highly original, supermeta inb4 schizo-projected-mirror-rehearsal of the spaghetti pasta wordsalad self-interview of someone who LARPs as an apathetic psychopath (because surely you are more than this):

As of this writing, I think that covers maybe half of what you [[publically self-model|PSM]] for us on plebbit.<<ref "pl">> There's not much to reduce down in your identity because you're already such a small and absurd person. Does the mirror look good to you? If that's really your story, I can see why you hate yourself. You're not much of a decent person yet either ([[WINTCIS]], though you are a person, a person who needs someone to think with them [I'm here, bud]), so just remember it takes time and empathy to build a fitting character. All is not lost though. I know. Take it from me:

You are a goldmine of authentic retardation, my ninja. I'm just not convinced you are proficient enough to be a monster.<<ref "97">> You haven't [[love]]d enough to really know how to hate well. I can see that you are lonely though, and I know how it do, homie. I pity us. Yeah, we're fucked up, but that's not all our fault. More importantly, we can do better. Let us learn to be [[Anonymous]] together as wisely as we can, moralfags of profound excellence. Let's write together. Seriously. Put your thoughts down and think about them. Empathize with yourself and others. It's going to be painful, but it's worth it. 

On a lighter note, you work very hard to seem like an ironic plebbitor,<<ref "p">> and it's hilarious. Perhaps we both enjoy [[Dune]] a whole bunch (a crucial book for this [[‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±]]). We could talk about LoL if you'd like (you are obviously intelligent enough to play these games). What do you think about world hunger? I'd be interested in thinking about what it means to maintain a signature identity on [[4chan|https://www.reddit.com/r/greentext/comments/m7031v/anon_hates_reddit/gragdlu/]] with you, if you'd like.

Look, I'm offering the same to [[the person you trolled|2021.03.28 - Variety Creepy: Out of the Blue]]. In fact, I'm bending over backwards for you. My bet (if he takes the time to think about it) is that he'll find this letter at least hilarious, if not vindicating; I think he'll pity you yet again, and I anticipate his response will [[aim]] for kindness. Will yours? Don't you think we're worth empathizing with? I hope you [[get your shit|/b/]] together. I'm here to talk if you want to seriously talk. You are going to have to put your skin in the game though. I'd like us to work toward actually building a relationship that matters together.

For fun, I've posted this to our beloved [[/b/]], [[here|https://boards.4chan.org/b/thread/850785545]], and also [[here|https://boards.4channel.org/lit/thread/17895005]]. I doubt anyone will care in the flood, but perhaps we may have some join us.


[[Love]],

[[h0p3]]
