[9:42 PM] h0p3: Btw, I'm happy to VC with you. Feel free to ring me up! I do best at night (which I think may complicate our ability to connect over VC sometimes), but I'd like to adjust my schedule to make sure our friendship continues to thrive. We should VC.
[9:43 PM] chameleon: by night you mean like... past 12:00pm TN time?
[9:43 PM] chameleon: I could feasibly call then. I'd just have to keep my voice down. TA sleeps at about 2am
[9:44 PM] h0p3: I prefer 10pm-2am, but I know that is such a weird window.
[9:44 PM] chameleon: usually that period is when I'm spending time with the hubby
[9:44 PM] chameleon: since he gets back at 10-ish
[9:44 PM] h0p3: Everything before 10pm tends to be with my family.
[9:44 PM] chameleon: the times we did before probably work the best
[9:44 PM] chameleon: yeah, I understand
[9:44 PM] chameleon: oof
[9:44 PM] chameleon: hehe
[9:45 PM] h0p3: What times are specifically the best for you?
[9:45 PM] h0p3: I want to put you on my calendar with consistency.
[9:45 PM] chameleon: I get up between 2 and 5 pm depending on how well I slept and how lazy I'm feeling. I use the first few hours I'm up to meditate, eat, do my chores.
[9:45 PM] h0p3: We are both nightowls :slight_smile:
[9:46 PM] h0p3: I adore that.
[9:46 PM] chameleon: by 6-7 I'm done and I'm free for basically the rest of the "day" until the hubby comes back
[9:46 PM] chameleon: hehe, yeah
[9:46 PM] chameleon: lifelong night owl here
[9:46 PM] chameleon: my bedtime was 9pm very early in my life, long before my siblings. and even then, I used to read harry potter by twilight =w=.
[9:46 PM] h0p3: :slight_smile:
[9:46 PM] chameleon: my mother couldn't be too angry with me, as a librarian, she was probably secretly happy I was sneaking in reading time
[9:47 PM] h0p3: Your mom sounds pretty badass to me.
[9:47 PM] h0p3: Super jelly
[9:48 PM] chameleon: she's pretty great. she has her neuroses, but she's a good person
[9:48 PM] chameleon: I bought her the complete poirot for her birthday last year. she's been working her way through it and really enjoying it
[9:48 PM] chameleon: she used to be a librarian but stopped working because of my siblings
[9:49 PM] chameleon: she's still very much a bookworm though
[9:49 PM] h0p3: :slight_smile:
[9:49 PM] chameleon: my mother and my father are both stereotypical geeks, haha
[9:49 PM] chameleon: pops is a programmer, warhammer nerd, gamer, and OG weeb
[9:49 PM] h0p3: aye
[9:55 PM] h0p3: I want to say once again that I am honored to be able to read your wiki. You do some hard work in it that both I and my daughter are lucky to read. I hope she gets to know you better too. She is free to speak with anyone about anything, and her computer is her computer.
[9:56 PM] chameleon: she's very welcome to! I think we're probably both a little shy
[9:58 PM] chameleon: and if you don't mind me "no u"-ing the compliment...
[9:58 PM] chameleon: no u ;P
[9:58 PM] chameleon: I am grateful to read your wiki in turn
[10:02 PM] h0p3: Lol! Thank you, that is kind, and I appreciate it. One of my favorite parts of our relationship is that we disagree so thoroughly in some places (and, obviously, we radically agree in others), and we still enjoy being with each other. It is rare that I get to enjoy the company of people with depth and understanding (or whatever I can muster) over such remote gaps. It's awesome. It is a highlight for me of what I hope to be and become.
[10:27 PM] h0p3: I've had sourdough on the brain too. Might be where we go as well.
[10:28 PM] chameleon: yeah! I miss it from back home
[10:28 PM] chameleon: there was a place that did German food - my favorite was the sandwich. Chicken schnitzel, mayo, lettuce, on fresh sourdough
[10:28 PM] chameleon: god that sandwich was good
[10:29 PM] chameleon: oh, and tomato!
[10:29 PM] chameleon: I'm going to try and recreate that sandwich, I think
[10:29 PM] h0p3: That sounds outstanding.
[10:30 PM] chameleon: they have a website, apparently: http://www.bakehaus.co.uk/
[10:30 PM] chameleon: if you're ever in Hammersmith, London, England, I strongly recommend this place
[10:30 PM] chameleon: they do great cakes/desserts, too!
