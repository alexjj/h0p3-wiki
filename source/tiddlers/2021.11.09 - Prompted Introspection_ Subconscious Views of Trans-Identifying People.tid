title: 2021.11.09 - Prompted Introspection: Subconscious Views of Trans-Identifying People

!! Regardless of you support or personal feelings, does your subconscious view trans-identifying people as closer to their birth or current gender?

This is not my first time responding to the matter.

My personal feelings are non-trivially enmeshed with my subconscious mental states (they might even be identical in some cases), though I don't claim to be coherent or to [[know myself|Know Thyself]] well enough. I can't claim to have sufficient access to my subconscious either, though it is non-zero. As an autistic person with such a particular background in religion and philosophy,<<ref "p">> my instinct is to view people as stuck in [[flesh|Embodied Cognition]]-prisons that give rise to emergent personhood. I work to maintain that. I [[aim]] to ignore the matter:<<ref "m">> gender is largely stupid,<<ref "w">> even if it becomes [[salient]] in a [[SO]] sense because people treat it as being more crucial than it is. It's not what matters most about who I am, and it's not what matters most about who you are either Samwise. It's not even close. Of course, as you know, Samwise, it's not like I don't enjoy stupidity (I'm talking to you right now, as it were), and I think there's cause to celebrate difference and the small things about us too. My fears for the risks people face given their telos tend to override how I reason and feel about most of their organs, parts, self-descriptions,<<ref "y">> and other degrees of their identities. Morally arbitrary characteristics like gender are accidents moreso than essence. You really want equality? Start there. Get behind the [[VOI]].

I'm not convinced either option captures my instincts well enough. It's like a false dichotomy. Their [[4DID]] is a process of many states (and more, arguably). Objectively: they are more than what they were born as, more than what they construct and interpret, more than their conditioning, more than what they are perceived as by we the [[fff]], and more than what they aspire to be. Insofar as it is a choice, it tends to be flat, permissible, and irrelevant compared to the kinds of choices that define us as moral beings. So, here you go: trans-identifying people are their own subset of our species. We each have our own history. They are sociologically abnormal<<ref "i">> in virtue of at least both of those points you pick out.

<<footnotes "w" "Which is not to say all struggles about the matter are stupid. However, I find most of the spectacle surrounding this issue a selfish bourgeois red herring. We have much bigger fish to fry in the prioritization of our lives in the moral realist pursuit of global [[justice]] than this. Not all suffering is equal, and I'm not going to be derailed from seeking what matters most in our context.">>

<<footnotes "y" "Yet again, I will point out that self-identification is not sufficient. That I say X represents Y does not make it so either in mapping or territory tout court.">>

<<footnotes "i" "I remind you, Samwise, that this is not a negatively charged word.">>
