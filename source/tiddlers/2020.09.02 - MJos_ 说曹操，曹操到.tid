Dear Maxwell,

It's good to hear from you.

I'm hanging in there. I've felt flooded, but I have little room to say anything. Given the [[dok]] to which you [[PSM]], it's difficult to see how well you are doing from over here, but I [[hope]] you are safe and well as well.

I was delighted, really actually delighted, to see that you are now collecting Chinese phrases on the "中国语录" page. I want to help you improve and expand this page's classification scheme and its contents. I've begun taking notes and will use the tiddler editor to add them when I can (unless there's a better way.)
<<<

I'm delighted too. ヘ( ^o^)ノ＼(^_^ ). I hope my ineptitude made you giggle some. 

It might be useful to use the tiddler editor for formatting, but you won't be able save to the wiki because I distribute read-only copies.<<ref "s">> Regardless, I assume your tooling and approach will be the correct one to use. The tiddler reminds me of living in Thailand with folks with English words on their shirts that they interpreted (if at all) differently than I did, or various tattoos I've seen on many bodies that didn't widely translate as the bearer thought.<<ref "i">> At best, it functions as a repo of emosymbols (or other similarly beautiful signs) for me. Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ. If you want to fix the ridiculousness and inaccuracy of it, go for it. My assumption is that you have far better things to do with your time, but I would adore having something that is more wisely organized and even roughly parallel and usable (though I simply have no idea how to gauge what is reasonable here) - I romantically prefer to think that randos like me and other folks might share something like the same signs and signifieds. I have no idea how to cut it down to something that makes the most sense for my context.

I've been lucky enough to have relationships with some translators (most of them with a specialized reading knowledge only<<ref "a">>), but probably none as skilled as you.<<ref "p">> You do have a way with words. If and when I am lucky enough, I would like to learn more about your philosophical and political perspectives on translation (and linguistics in general). Maybe how you engage in the practice already makes that clear to someone who is qualified to weigh the merits of your translation work. I'm obviously blind here. 

I think learning to do your work would be an impossible task for me. If any, what kinds of surprising and low-hanging fruit multi-lingual hacks for absolute noobs stand out to you?

Since I don't know how often you read my website, I thought I'd bring my website to you.
<<<

Cool. I also don't know how often you read my site. I assume it happens when it happens. I keep your site in my [[FTO]] personal sites bookmarks folder for opening up them all. It's one of the things I haven't yet found a nice way to transfer into the wiki; eventually, I'd like to have a button to just open all the links in a single tiddler. Your practice reminds me of a newsletter or a follow-up e-mail.

1) Further thinking and design toward the "linguist's working environment" application I mused about in my last letter to you.

I can only imagine that the search for the tooling could be endless here. It seems like a job too large for a single person (or a lifetime of work). I assume you have to be super practical about it (and, I still don't know what it would [let alone should] look like, even with what you've described). I hope you'll consider disregarding IP barriers entirely.

I'm all about the bunghole tickling! (/¯–‿･)/¯

I recall reading the Portland piece because it reminded me of [[2020.06.01 - Antipleonasm Analysis: MLK's Durable Social Phenomena]] and my brother [[AIR]]. Your approach is far more light-hearted. I admire that.

<<<
3) I've lightly updated the text of "Man from H.0.P.3.". Just letting you know in case you want to do an update, though I like the idea of your webpage preserving the original.
<<<

I see that. I hate to say it, but even English poetry and song lyrics aren't things I know how to proficiently translate for myself.<<ref "m">> Even that gracious poem is something that I had to ask my wife and daughter to digest with me. I appreciate that you draft; being willing to change our minds and the art in our words is crucial, [[WINTCIS]]. I am happy to update it if you prefer, and I like the idea of keeping multiple versions (I do the same with my own work). At the very least, I think a link to the current living draft might help.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]

<<footnotes "i" "I'm also reminded of the imperialism of a global language, or maybe that the significant percentage of English users who aren't native or who wouldn't consider themselves strongly culturally connected to the language are themselves owners and shapers of the insanity that is the English language too. I have no idea how to draw the boundaries in a way that makes sense to me, and I don't aim to be relativistic about it. Maybe [[入乡随俗]] fits here: I don't know."
