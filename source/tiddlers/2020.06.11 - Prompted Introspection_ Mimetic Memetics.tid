title: 2020.06.11 - Prompted Introspection: Mimetic Memetics

!! Tell about a habit that you picked up from a family member or friend.

Yes, [[2019.03.25 - Prompted Introspection: Habit of Other]] is correct. I still think the spirit of the [[prompt]] has plenty of merit. Constructing ourselves with [[The Other]] is often about picking out their [[salient]] habits and applying them in our contexts. Fitting mimetic memetics should be celebrated. I chose a happy, pleasant one last time. Let me choose an unhappy, unpleasant one this time.

I'm contrarian. I don't just mean I hold contrarian views, nor am I merely claiming that my autistic ignorance of social convention is a sufficient reason for my contrariety. I don't see myself as a rebel, but I've got a punk "fuck you" attitude when my patience runs out.<<ref "j">> I don't give a fuck if my view is contrarian except insofar as it is problematic for achieving my ends, and my ends tend to be vastly different than most humans I've met. 

I attribute my willingness to be contrarian to my male donor, [[MWF]] (as I have mentioned: [[2019.04.12 - Prompted Introspection: Male Donor Personality]]), and Madame Ronna Burger in teaching me [[Straussian]] hermeneutics.
