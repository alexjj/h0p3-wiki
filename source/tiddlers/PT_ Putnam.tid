* "Truth" is some sort of ideal coherence of our beliefs with each other and with our experiences, not correspondence with mind-independent "states of affairs".
* "Objects" do not exist independently of conceptual schemes; we cut up the world into objects when we introduce one or another scheme of description.
* There can be equally coherent but incompatible conceptual schemes which fit our experience equally well.
* The meaning of a concept depends on its role in a network ('cluster') of concepts, which can change in the light of experience.
* If the analytic sentences are all consequences of some finite list of meaning postulates, then there must be synthetic truths in mathematics
* The identities of our thoughts are not purely psychological; they are affected by their worldly context.
* Our scientific knowledge allows us to reach essentialist hypotheses such as "Water = H20".
* One cannot refer to things if one has no casual interaction at all with them, or with things in terms of which they are described
* A brain in a vat being deceived by mad scientists cannot think of brains or vats; they play no part in explaining its neural inputs.
* We cannot be brains in vats being deceived by mad scientists, because we can think of brains in vats.
* Mental states are not identical to physical states because a mental state can be realized by multiple physical states (in different organisms).
* Mental states are computational states, not identified by their physical realizations but by their functional roles.
