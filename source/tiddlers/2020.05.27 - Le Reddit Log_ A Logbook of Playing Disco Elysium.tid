title: 2020.05.27 - Le Reddit Log: A Logbook of Playing Disco Elysium

https://www.reddit.com/r/DiscoElysium/comments/grt1qo/a_logbook_of_playing_disco_elysium/

I'm just starting this game with my offspring. We're all taking notes in our wikis as we play. It gives us a lot to talk about (including how much the game has in common with keeping a wiki). If you are interested, here's mine: https://philosopher.life/#Disco%20Elysium

This is wholesome and fun :). I just finished today. There’s a lot of wtf, but the best suggestion I got was to not try to metagame, just enjoy the ride and don’t worry about not knowing why stuff is important.

How old is your son? I found a lot of the themes very mature and relatable to my own life experience growing up and maturing. I think I would have experienced the game very differently in my teens than now in my 30’s.

I am doing my best not to metagame (hard not to think about the ludology) and enjoy the narrative. I'm a metagamer through and through (my son and I are autistic). My daughter RPs a lot, so this is far closer to her thing.

I'm in my 30's too. My son is 12. I don't censor, and I try to tell the truth as best as I know how, including to my offspring (which is sometimes really fucked up and painful). We homeschool, so I consider it part of my job to expose them to worlds (be they good, bad, right, wrong, beautiful, or ugly); this is one of our classes atm (it is a shared world and experience to reference). I am curious to see how he thinks and feels about the game too.

Thanks for the thoughts :) reading your comments I definitely don’t have the same game-theory knowledge as you, which would probably give you a very different perspective than me on the game. I’m just going through a tough time IRL and lots of the content was relatable and cathartic in a way. I’d be interested to hear your overall thoughts on the game when you finish.

Hey, I don't know your situation, but if you could use a friend to speak with, I am always available (even if I'm slow and weird). I know I'm just a random person, but I've, uh, been through some tough times myself before. I hope you are not suffering alone. It's important that you have people who care about you, especially as the world continues to get crazier. I appreciate how this game is relatable. Parts of it are too real to me.

I'm basically a madman; so, I don't know if I would be useful to you, but it is my honor to hospitably speak with people over my wiki (though it doesn't look like much, it's about 60 100k novels in length). I do my best to listen carefully. I hope to be a thorough interlocutor (some of my correspondence lasts for hundreds of pages). https://philosopher.life/#Find%20The%20Others. Heads up, my posts on Reddit disappear within 72 hours, but my offer stands regardless. If you need an ear, don't hesitate. I might not be your cup of tea, but keep me in your back pocket just in case.

Also, spoilers aren't a problem for me, in case you just want to talk about the game now. Otherwise, I've marked down in my notes to contact you if and when I finish the game. I will be interested to hear your perspective.

Thanks for the offer :) I’m lucky to have lots of support. It’s the internal me that’s being the issue (and some external factors).

Hope you enjoy the game and keep taking your time with it :)
