`/salute` How was your week?
Fri 10:17am
Hey
Fri 9:38pm
Hmm...My device didn't notify me to this message
Fri 9:39pm
But I wanted to check in and ask you the same thing
Fri 9:39pm
I'm feeling a bit down. But not due to anything in particular.
Fri 9:40pm
Wednesday was nice actually, we've opened up our home for weekly prayer meetings
Fri 9:40pm
My mom's been having dizzy spells, which is worrying. Selah and i have talked tentatively about a future where she might move in with us
Fri 9:41pm
Selah's brother got married in Toronto. We joined them for it. It was an informal civil union, but I was glad to meet many branches of her family who live out there whom I'd never met
Fri 9:42pm
Took a day off on Monday to pass through and enjoy the small time of Gananoque on the way back.
Fri 9:43pm
BTW, I checked the drive time from here to New Haven, and it's just 6 hours. Basically same distance as from here to Toronto!
Fri 9:43pm

Ah, don't worry! Signal might be one of the better tools in this sphere, but it has many intended and unintended flaws from what I can tell. Regardless, take as much time as you need to respond, lol. Asynchronous communications are a privilege.
Sat 11:06pm
I'm sorry to hear you are feeling a bit down. I'm hoping Wednesdays will become a highlight of your weeks.
Sat 11:07pm
I realize it's a risk, but I don't see how people can get away with not being with others (no way around our needs as humans here). Blessed be the tie that binds. I hope your cell is healthy in every way.

Dizzying spells are worrying. Feels like that has been on the rise. I don't know enough about them, but I would worry more if those spells continued for months. It might not be easy to determine what causes them. I can imagine it is expensive to think about this problem too. You guys have already had so many transitions in such a short period of time.
Sat 11:14pm
Congratz to your brother! I am benignly envious (happy for you) that you get to build roots and branches. They seem pretty cool?
Sat 11:17pm
Did you get to be near the water at Gananoque?
Sat 11:18pm
6 hours aint bad! Way better than what it was a year ago, lol.
