title: 2020.12.13 - Family Log: My k button is fucking up

!! Write a paragraph summarizing each person's week:

* [[1uxb0x]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I think I worked hard, but not as hard as I could've, it feels like it's been three or two weeks since we left the condo. I've started losing track of the week, and day, I don't know which month we're in, but it's been a good one for me. I've much more liked the lifting and carrying of shit. I shouldn't have ever won against Goblin charbelcher with a three card hand in a slow deck. I've loved playing magic: and I think the change to back to basics in my deck was a good idea.

*** It's pretty amazing to me how you never lose your temper. NULL/void is already sounding pretty awesome, and I hope you keep building it out! Maybe I can get Smokey to help. Your other characters are taking on some life and personality, too. It's fascinating how much history (especially relating to war and gun) you know off the top of your head. Do you think you picked that up from games/videos?
** k0sh3k
*** You worked hard getting the house ready, and I really appreciate it. I like the way you put your quilts up on the back of your bed to turn your desk into a private little cave. I enjoyed our M:TG games and watching you play w/ Swicky and your dad.

*** [[1uxb0x]] has been studying his MUC deck, and it's been fun thinking about [[MTG]] with him on our breaks. I'm, ofc, disappointed and will hold a grudge forever to have lost so many games to him this week. I am convinced he will become a significantly stronger player than me if he wastes his time long enough (good job :P). His planning for his ~~masturbation~~ private mancave was rational, and it will surely buy him the precious 5 seconds he needs to cover his shame before any creature can round the corner (unless, of course, they pierce the veil [I will make sure to stealth-Kramer-burst through the door liveleak-cameras loaded, sprinting around the spiral maze every time]). He worked hard this week. Our house is functioning because he has thrown down to make it happen. He has been muscle and brains making a life for us. We've had a lot of fun too, surprisingly. One day, he will likely be the man who fixes this house. I [[hope]] it will be a place of comfort, safety, and contemplation for him.

* [[j3d1h]]
** 1uxb0x
*** We've talked a lot about characters, and I'd love to keep talking about them. We've gotten angry at eachother more this week. I want to play more magic with you, but then again, I just always want to be with you more. Thank you for being the brain in the construction of the stuff.
** j3d1h
*** The passage of time is no longer a concept or sense I can use. 2020 broke it. The last couple weeks have spanned months - maybe it's because of all the manual labor and whatnot. It's probably just the fact that I have to map out new territory again, though. I'm just glad we got the house and I don't hate it.
** k0sh3k
*** You also worked hard getting the house ready, and I really appreciate it. I like the thought you've put into how you want to arrange things from the very beginning. I enjoyed planting M:TG with you and also just talking to you about various things. 
** h0p3
*** [[j3d1h]] has led the construction charge, directing her brother and me often enough. She wasn't always happy this week, understandably, but she got the job done. We needed it too; there was no way we could be sitting here typing and talking comfortably without all of her work. She was also more motivated to control her own space, and that's been a special set of moments for us. Days have been vivid with her, and likely for her. It's been a high novelty week.

* [[k0sh3k]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I don't get to play much magic against you. We don't have that much important, content filled interaction these days, mostly just advent. I've been loving the ginger beer, please get more. (we run low on ginger water) Advent has been good, and I like how you do church as well.
** j3d1h
*** Thanks for helping us (all) pick out Christmas presents. You're pretty much the best at this, of course. I'm sorry SC is bothering you so much, he's just lazy as hell. This washer and dryer were great picks, thank you! John is, apparently, living the life. 2020 has changed a lot of people's minds about the world, I'm just not sure whether that's a good thing.
** k0sh3k
*** I had legit forgotten how crazy this past week has been. Between getting the internet set up and the landlord being a bitch, I was stressed - but everything got done. I was worried, too, about SC having Covid, but I'm still testing negative, so I'm cautiously optimistic that I'm safe for the rest of this crazy year. I was busy at work and at home, but things are coming together at both places nicely!
** h0p3
*** [[k0sh3k]] has busted her ass this week. The CV19 insanity continues (she continues to be more in charge than she's supposed to be) and then the move/unpacking/accounting after she got home. It's been triage.week for her. I've not secured her enough time to chill, and that is a debt I need to pay back. She was extra forgiving of my mistakes this week (beyond the usual); it just rolled off her back, and I'm [[grateful]] to have had so much support while rolling the house out. She's made time for [[Family Gathering]]s, pie, and even //Inform the Men!//. We have one more week of pushing at 50% of the previous week's cost before her soft vacay, and winter is coming.

* [[h0p3]]
** 1uxb0x
*** Yes yes, I know I should look at magic cards and the such. Thank you for helping me with my magic deck. On the topic of magic, It's still funny that I had a three-card hand and beat goblin charbelcher. You're great at being disgusting.
** j3d1h
*** Fear of failure's a pretty powerful thing (looking at Q&A here too). Talking to a voice you can try to shape is always easier. Sorry you had to deal with the landlord - she sounds worse than our previous ones, though I don't remember interacting with any of them much. Meds are one of those downplayed symbols in the world, to me (something is clearly wrong). Also, I haven't noticed any heating problems - might just be my door staying closed all the time.
** k0sh3k
*** You did so much work this week, and I appreciate it. You kept much calmer about the Washer Debacle than I would have, for sure. I had a great week with you, getting the house set up and suchlike. Playing M:TG has been fun, especially when I win. Which I did three times in a row. I want an updated Ajani Pridemate deck. I love that you're already making a TDL for the long-haul of living here!
** h0p3
*** [[h0p3]] worked hard, but he also got plenty of chill time in. His hikicave is amazeballs, including some of the best sleep he's had in a while on that delicious mattress. He's not sure what he's doing well enough, but the house congeals. His goal is to prep for a staycation for his wife with as minimal interaction with the offline world as possible for the rest of the month. He's played a fuckton of [[MTG]] with folks. He's lucky to have worked alongside his offspring this week, and the house is in better shape than he predicted. It's been a productive offline week.
