That's a [[good]] point! I [[like]] this feller you picked out, dearest anon.<<ref "j">> Thank you. 

<<<
[When considering] [m]etaphysics, because it opens out a limitless vista of possibilities, [we] must take care never to lose sight of the inexpressible [to some [[dok]] for we the [[fff]]], which indeed constitutes [at least a part of] its very essence.
<<<

<<<
There is [~~exact~~ a] correspondence between a world where everything seems to be in a state of mere “becoming,” leaving no place for the changeless and permanent, and the state of mind of men who find all reality in this same “becoming,” denying by implication true knowledge as well as the object of that knowledge, by which we mean the transcendent and universal principles. 
<<<

<<<
[Sometimes unjustifiably,] men [begin] to glory in their ignorance—for to proclaim oneself an agnostic means nothing else—...claiming to forbid others any knowledge to which they themselves have no access.
<<<

<<<
If an idea is true, it belongs equally to all [~~who are capable of understanding it~~ or none at all]...for ideas, insofar as they are true, are not the property of anyone [in particular]. 
<<<

<<<
It [appears it] is contradictory to say that the same person can be at the same time ruler and ruled. … The great ability of those who are in control in the modern world lies in making the people believe that they are governing themselves; and the people are the more inclined to believe this as they are flattered by it, as they are in any case [almost] incapable of sufficient reflection to see its [~~impossibility~~ falsehood]. It was to create this illusion that “universal suffrage” was invented: the law is supposed to be made by the opinion of the majority, but what is overlooked is that this opinion is something that can very easily be guided and modified; it is always possible, by means of suitable suggestions, to arouse in it currents moving in this or that direction as desired. We cannot recall who it was that first spoke of “manufacturing opinion,” but this expression is very apt. 
<<<

<<<
“Aristocracy,” … taken in its etymological sense, means precisely the power of the [State of Nature's] elect. The elect, by the very definition of the word, can only be the few, and their [[power]], or rather their [legal positivistic] authority, being due to their [~~intellectual superiority~~ material privileges], has [~~nothing~~ something roughly] in common with the numerical strength on which democracy is based, a strength whose inherent tendency is to sacrifice the minority to the majority, and therefore [~~quality to quantity and~~ sometimes] the elect to the masses.<<ref "i">>
<<<

<<<
There can be only one way out of the chaos, in the social domain as in all others: the restoration of [justified] intellectuality, which would result in the formation [~~once more~~] of a[~~n~~ justified] elect. 
<<<

<<<
It sometimes so happens that people who imagine that they are fighting the devil, whatever their particular notion of the devil may be, are thus turned, without any suspicion of the fact on their part, into his best servants!
<<<

<<<
[All else being equal,] [t]he destructive action of time only allows what is [transcendentally] superior to time to survive.
<<<

<<<
Creation is the work of the Word; it is also, and by this very fact, [''''[[It]]s] manifestation, [''''[[It]]s] outward affirmation; and this is why the world is like a divine language, for those who know how to understand it: Caeli enarrant gloriam Dei (The heavens declare the glory of God, Ps. XIX:2)

<<footnotes "j" "We don't see eye to eye on [[Justice]]. However, I don't seem to get along with Jung (we cannot always justifiably embrace/reconcile with the 'dark' parts of who we are, surgery can be obligated) or materialists either. I think René Guénon and I would have plenty to speak about regarding [[awe]]. We'd get along with being hyperreligious rather than merely 'spiritual' (i.e. looks like narcissism to me!). We would rumble about instrumentality, but I think we have common sympathies. He seems to fight for a mediated relationship between (rather than a conflation of) the subconscious and the supraconscious, the internal subsymbolic and the external supersymbolic, or something like this. It's easy not be precise enough with one's words, of course.">>

<<footnotes "i" "I take [[The Philosopher King|Justice]] exceptionally seriously. The justified elect (the wise) would have argued about class and representation of the ideal here!">>
