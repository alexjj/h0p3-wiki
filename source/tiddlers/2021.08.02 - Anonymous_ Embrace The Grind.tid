You: Hello! =)
Stranger: hey
You: What brings you here today?
Stranger: I can't sleep so I figured I'd come talk to people. You?
You: Noice. Pretty similar. I'm up late (Eastern Time), trying to speak with people, understand what's going on, who we are, etc.
You: Omegle is an interesting place to type with humans. Adding tags seems to cut through some of the ASL/Bored/Cyborz/Bot noise.
Stranger: yeah for sure haha
Stranger: oh eastern nice. You're from the US?
You: I am. Originally, Chicago, grew up in the Appalachian region, but I've traveled some. Currently in New England.
You: How about you? (whatever is safe to say*)
Stranger: oh my. You won't believe where I'm from, then
You: Oh, well, then please elaborate!
Stranger: Chicago! haha
You: lmao
You: I'm from humboldt park
Stranger: That's cool
You: that was in the 80's though*
Stranger: ah I gotcha. I move there in a month
Stranger: I see. I don't think I'm familiar with the area
You: Why you moving?
Stranger: College
You: Dope.
You: Heading back or first time?
Stranger: First time! Pretty scared to say the least
You: I hear that.
Stranger: I was supposed to move in last year. Then Covid happened so
You: Yeah. Completely fucked with everything, especially students. It's horrific.
You: How were you able to delay attending? Did that affect you significantly?
You: What school?
Stranger: Oh yeah I agree. It was terrible..kind of
Stranger: Basically all my classes were online on Zoom
You: (it didn't affect me all that much, not in my day-to-day sense...but, I'm a fucking hiki basement-dweller, I was always quarantining)
You: Jesus. Hell.
Stranger: it was nice, honestly. How many times can you say you attended chemistry in bed? haha
You: Oh, well, not hell for you.
You: Good.
You: I cannot stand being on Zoom, lmao.
Stranger: oh, and Loyola!
You: Noice.
You: `/high-5`
Stranger: me neither lolll
You: You have a major(s) in mind?
Stranger: Yeah! Biology
You: Any particular focus?
Stranger: hm I guess pre med
Stranger: Although med school isn't really in the cards for me
You: Oh. Why??
Stranger: Well
You: Shit is expensive*
Stranger: hahahah
Stranger: Not to say I don't want to focus somewhere in medicine
Stranger: that too
Stranger: I'm already dying when it comes to the college workload
You: I hear that.
Stranger: I am not sure I'd enjoy the med school lifestyle
You: They grind a fuckton.
Stranger: Yeah, apparently they study 14 hours a day lmaooo
Stranger: props to them but I guess it's not for basement dwellers like us
You: lol :P
You: this is me btw (feel free to ignore it entirely): https://philosopher.life (in case you ever wanted to get in touch again)
You: I think you'll enjoy living there. It's a totally different experience.
You: Hopefully, transformative and years you'll look back on with delight.
Stranger: Oh, nice! I just took a look at it
Stranger: I am guessing you discuss philosophy. Fun fact I take philosophy this semester :P
You: I can't help you with Biology, but if you needed help with digital resources or thinking about a topic in the Humanities, I might be useful.
You: I do discuss philosophy, a lot. Can't say I'm good at it.
You: I'm full blown retard, my friend.
You: What philosophy course?
Stranger: ahaha
Stranger: These things interest me. Although I've never really delved into it and probably never would've had my college not forced me to
Stranger: Intro to Philosophy
You: That's the magic of college. Opened me right up too.
Stranger: And then I take philosophy-related courses over the next 3 years too
Stranger: Why do you like it so much?
You: Hrm. I write about this quite a bit (and I can point you to places if you prefer), but I don't want to waste your time (I'm boring by comparison, much rather hear about your life, lol). I think the pursuit of wisdom is something everyone must do. It's the only way we can make the world what it ought to be. It's only way to justifiably flourish (eudaimonia is the three dollar word here).
You: I used to teach it at Tulane.
You: Now, I just talk with whoever wants to about it.
Stranger: Oh, no way!!!
You: It was quite an experience.
You: I have 11 years of post-secondary education under my belt. Very glad I did it, though I have a hard time seeing myself going back (except just to sneak into classes and seminars and so forth ;P)
Technical error: Server was unreachable for too long and your connection was lost. Sorry. :( Omegle understands if you hate it now, but Omegle still loves you.

Shit. They were typing for a long time. Then it kaboomed. =(. `/shakes-fist`. Welp, maybe we'll meet again.

You both like Psychology.
Stranger: Hi
You: Hello!
You: What brings you here today?
Stranger: I don’t know just wanted to talk about some deep stuff with someone
You: Cool.
Stranger: And you
You: I'm happy to do my best for you.
You: I'm here to speak with people about whatever matters most, and hopefully we can figure that out.
Stranger: Alright
You: What kind of deep stuff are you into?
Stranger: Well just like what’s written in our taste: psychology
You: Cool, what parts of psychology then?
You: I'm a novice*
Stranger: Most of the times I like to talk about things like anxiety or anger or anything else that makes human get out of control (in terms of psychology of course)
You: Yes. That's a crucial problem.
Stranger: Yup
You: Regulating ourselves is a moral problem.
Stranger: Yeah pretty much
You: I have plenty of anxiety and anger in my life, lol. I work to channel and manage them.
You: I bet that's pretty common.
Stranger: A channel like from tv or a site?
You: Perhaps. I initially meant more like "directing" these emotions.
You: They can be useful and even justified emotions to have. It can be rational. But, not always, obviously.
Stranger: Ooh ok my bad
You: Oh, fear not, I'm not a clear communicator. I'm autistic.
You: (I also have Geschwind Syndrome)
Stranger: Actually English is not my fist language you know
You: Cool.
You: What languages do you speak? Where are you from?
You: (I can only speak English, and poorly at that, lol. I'm from the US, East Coast right now)
Stranger: Wait let read everything
You: Take as much time as you wish. I'm here to speak for as long as you want. You can pick out what we'll talk about (I talk too much).
Stranger: I actually speak Portuguese and I’m from Japan
You: Damn. That is hella awesome.
Stranger: Thanks
You: That's an interesting mix. I'm reminded of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyoto_Machida
You: (I used to be an MMA junky)
Stranger: Cool
Stranger: What’s geschiwind syndrome by the way
You: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geschwind_syndrome
You: I write a lot (like, compulsively).
You: I'm hyperreligious, hypersexual (I probably [[masturbate]] 2-3 times a day on average, and have sex as much as [[my wife]] will have with me).
Stranger: Oh so it means you like to express yourself a lot?
You: Oh, incredible amounts. You wouldn't believe it.
You: This is from today: https://philosopher.life/#New
You: (can see the past 7 days, actually...there are over 15k posts in that wiki from the past 5 years)
You: I'm a freak. lol.
Stranger: But like how can you masturbate 3 times per day
You: I put toys on my penis and move them until I ejaculate. :P
Stranger: Doesn’t your body gets really tired?
You: I keep records of my habit in the [[Carpe Tempus Segmentum]] log.
You: Uh, sure, sometimes.
You: I really [[like]] it though.
Stranger: I mean if I masturbate one time per day my body would literally die
Stranger: Of tiredness
You: I probably have more testosterone than average. Balding, I'm extremely hairy. That might play a role.
You: It runs in the family.
Stranger: Huh it makes sense
You: But, also, like...I'm neurodiverse. That plays a serious role. I'm not chemically or psychological dependent upon the practice, it's not compulsive either. I also have more time to engage in the activity than most.
You: I'm hikikomori.
You: I spend 12 hours a day in front of my [[computer]].
Stranger: Oh really
You: In my basement, like a true neckbeard. Hehe.
You: Yeah. Long time computer addict.
You: (I'm sorry that we're talking so much about me, that is rude* - feel free to change subjects at-will; I'll talk about whatever you want to speak about)
Stranger: Well I don’t wanna be that guy but I think it’s not really healthy to stay inside at home most of the times
You: That is fair to say.
You: And, you should tell me what you think.
You: I appreciate honesty.
Stranger: But you stay at home because you want, or because you’re scared to get out of home
You: I wouldn't call it a strong phobia. There are weeks that I don't step outside.
You: You can see in my [[CTS]] logs, however, that I do go out into the world. I regularly walk with my offspring and my wife in our neighborhood (try to speak with neighbors). I go shopping too, run errands.
You: I take my work seriously, and I find exploring the world through my [[monster]] (my computer) is more efficient and effective (including communicating with people).
You: (Btw, these are [[Link]]s inside my wiki, pages that can be searched and linked to. This is the formatting for them in my wiki.)
Stranger: But like do you think that you’re hikikomori is problem for you
You: I think that it poses some problems, yes. In an ideal world, I would be physically present with people more than I am.
Stranger: I see
Stranger: Sorry but I think I gotta go now
You: Alright. It was a pleasure to meet you.
Stranger: The conversation was good actually
You: Feel free to contact me again, if you want to speak. https://philosopher.life/#Contact%20h0p3
Stranger: Ok
You: `/salute`
Stranger: Bye~
Stranger has disconnected.

We didn't really get to talk about any deep stuff. =/. I think I fucked that up. 

Hidden gem for me: I like to "express" myself. XD. Awwww Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaahhh. I love when mommy's milkers "express" themselves too. Do you want some boimilk?

You both like Philosophy.
You: Hello! =)
Stranger: Hey
You: What brings you here today?
Stranger: Just as usual as every other day
You: Oh, neat. You come here often then?
Stranger: No too often, it's kind of like a phase, what about you?
You: Ah. I see.
You: I get it. Cool.
You: We are both tagged with an interest in philosophy.
You: What kinds of philosophy interest you?
You: Oh, forgot to answer: I don't come often. I have this past week though.
Stranger: You mean philosophical schools of thoughts or branches of philosophy?
You: I am happy to listen and talk about either.
Stranger: Oh, I like axiology
Stranger: And metaphysics
Stranger: Wby?
You: I'm a huge fan of those topics.
Stranger: Nice
You: Can't say I'm skilled in understanding them.
You: Most of my work is in moral philosophy.
Stranger: Oh, morality that's interesting
You: Some find it an archaic topic these days.
You: Maybe too dogmatic even.
Stranger: Yeah, like wether morality is subjective or objective
Stranger: Or is it relative
Stranger: All those different thoughts been around here for a long time
You: I think that might be the primary question I run into with most people.
You: True. Older than dirt. Lol.
Stranger: Oh, can't say that
Stranger: Well, it depends on what you believe tho
You: That is fair to say.
You: Axiology has some overlap with this, metaphysics too.
Stranger: Yeah
Stranger: Axiology is in a sense valuing
Stranger: So yeah
Stranger: What are your thoughts on morality?
You: It would be difficult to say them all (I'm happy to direct you to my writing if you want). Perhaps this is a good starting place: I believe there are objects with intrinsic value that are external to us.
You: I'm a fan of the Categorical Imperative, but I admire other realist approaches.
You: I think [[The Good]] is dialectically comprised of [[The Right]] and [[The Beautiful]].
Stranger: What did you mean by external to us, is that in a physical sense?
You: I'm not certain, but I am confident that the physical world obtains. I meant external to our minds, and there may be several ways in which that obtains.
You: How about you?
Stranger: There are objects exist with values that are external to our mind? Sorry I have trouble understanding that
You: I'm sorry. I'm never clear enough.
Stranger: Well, I'm not that sharpest mind around there
You: Oh, no worries. I'm full-blown retarded.
You: Lol
Stranger: Yeah, I vouch for the relative morality
You: That gives me some context. Thank you.
You: My claim is that moral value is real, that there exists at least one moral proposition that has a truth value, and that these claims are not soley in virtue of our subjectivity (though there may be some dependency).
You: I consider moral value to be a matter of metaphysics. The noumena contains mathematical truths and moral ones, though I don't know well enough what it means to say that.
You: If you don't mind me asking, why do you vouch for the relativity of morality?
You: (also, please feel free to change topics with me...I'm a sticky person in conversation)
Stranger: It's not a physical thing, it could chage with so many factors since it's a collective thought
Stranger: And what did you mean by moral value is real, is that in an empirical sense?
You: Well, perhaps we need to define what it means for something to be real. I agree that empiricism plays a necessary role, but I do not agree it is a sufficient epistemic method.
You: I'm surprised to hear you say it is a not a physical thing.
You: And, I do not understand why you believe it is a collective thought. That may be correct in several respects though.
Stranger: Yeah, I think it's not. It's more like a logical reasoning thing, You have a set of statements and you have to derive a conclusion which is well thought out and reasonable
You: Is that logic something that is processed in the physical world, and the truth-bearer obtains only in material? Or, are you possibly suggesting that this logic is metaphysical?
You: (I realize it's like two people trying to figure out how to translate their languages together real-time*)
You: (You have an interesting position to me, btw)
Stranger: Those factors always changes, so you can't actually say there's something as absolute truth or wrong, since it's always relative
You: Is that statement always true?
Stranger: That's not a statement, it's more like an opinion
Stranger: If all the humans die, maybe that opinion won't be true, as a matter if fact it wouldn't even exists
Stranger: And yeah it's not always true
You: Okay, an opinion is a belief (maybe not one that we can justify as much as we'd prefer). A belief is taking up some proposition to be true, roughly, right? Can 1+1=2 be true without person believing it to be true?
Stranger: Mathematics can only be right with in the boundary of mathematical rules
Stranger: Out of that it's not right
Stranger: So, 1+1=2 only if that person follows that rules,else it's not
You: Is that itself a mathematical claim about mathematics we might take up? Or is it more?
Stranger: I'm sorry I gotta go
You: Okay. Have a good one!
You: `/salute`

You: It's a chance to practice being human, thinking about what it means to be one with [[others]].
