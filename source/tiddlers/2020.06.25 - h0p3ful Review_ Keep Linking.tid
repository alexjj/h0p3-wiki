*[[Drafting: Anaximenes]]
** Much, much better than last week. Thank you, sir.
** You still need to work on delivery and the thesis commitment.
*** Please practice your presentation //before// you give it. Rehearse.
*[[Notage Ti.54]]
** `/facepalm`. This hurts me inside. I love you.
*[[The Lightning Thief: 17 + 18, notes]]
** I feel like your notes don't have much in them this round, but I'm glad to see your links. Links are key.
*** I want to see you dumping your links more often in your notes. Keep what you harvested. Make it easy to restore your research sessions or to evaluate how you go about the process. I see a lot of potential in organizing and maintaining a large collection of links, of course. Better to get even bare links on the page than nothing at all.
*[[2020/06/24 – Wiki Review: Notes from the day after]]
** Okay, I'll retract it. You weren't parroting. Make sure you connect the dots more thoroughly.
** I'm glad to see more wrestling in your [[review]]. Keep it up.
*[[2020.06.24  – TDL: Walking with monsters]]
** I'm sad to see that my work didn't show up at all in here. =/. 
** What about planning dinner?
*[[2020/06/24 -- Prompted Introspection: Love]]
** I hear ya. Were I in your shoes, I would feel the same way.
*[[2020.06.24 – Carpe Diem: Summer is hell, winter is heaven.]]
** I don't think you remember how cold you were over the winter. CT's summer has been very pleasant.
*** I don't understand what you are claiming then.
** You could have something to carry your stuff, yeah? 
*** I use to have a bright pink fanny pack with a bank logo on it. 
** This is still too sparse, sir.
*[[2020/06/24 -- Antipleonasm Analysis: Wha its see thi sayi isng that.]]
** John Greenleaf Whittier, //Maud Muller//
** I'm glad to see you tackle the meaning of the quote.
** Do you believe the quote's sentiment or attitude can be destructive or inappropriate in some cases?
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** I forgot about the runs you used to take, [[2017.06.26 -- School Log]]. Have you considered picking it back up? That trail is gorgeous.
** I really enjoyed [[2019.06.26 – Practical Computer Projects: Not good.]] with you. It's remained an important topic for us over the past year. 
*** How many times have we been stuck in the grocery store aisles arguing about this? Lol.
