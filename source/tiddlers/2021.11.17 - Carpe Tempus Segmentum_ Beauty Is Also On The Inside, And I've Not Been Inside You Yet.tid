title: 2021.11.17 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Beauty Is Also On The Inside, And I've Not Been Inside You Yet

Sleep by 12:30? Drunk, but good sleep. Rare.

Woke at 8:30. [[TTTOTW]]. Hugs'n'bugs for everyone (even [[k0sh3k]] is here today!). My daughter's continued aggression and negative feelings flow forth. May she find worthy places to channel her energy. [[Morning Routine]]. [[TTTOTW]].

Mi amor came down for //Skintime// and talking about her balancing act with me. 

[[TTTOTW]]. [[5c0ut]] came to get me. The condensation we've found on the stairway to the attic now had streaks of what felt and looked like grease! Ventilation is not amazing in our kitchen, so that is a possibility, but the distance is surprising to me. Cleaned it up. [[TTTOTW]]. Finishing two [[Letters]] in one day. I've gone full retard.

Hugs'n'bugs and plans with erryone (a full house today is dope). Neo-Yokion snax + The Grind in [[The Den]] with my offspring. [[TTTOTW]]. Git and [[Rust]]. 

//The Walk// with the offspring. My daughter was in a pissy mood, but after the initial u-loop, she was happy to be there (yet again, nobody tell her that she had a good time!). He's going much more slowly through git, but I'm fine with aiming for mastery here (already knows plenty the rest of us don't). It could easily be a lifelong tool for him. My daughter claimed to do work in [[Rust]] on two types of errors (and had simple explanations), but we never really got to it (she wasn't in the mood for talking, and obviously had written nothing). Elaine stopped us. Hugs, invited us to see progress, retold her stories, forgot our names (understandably!), talked about where our house was again, fixed her heater, refuses to write anything down (the lord, of course, will guide her...many stories from her on this matter too). We were called angels sent by God, people she prayed for each day and right as she was coming out too. She says we make her day, and we remain at maximum politeness. Elaine reads my daughter like a book too (which I find hilarious), and for all I know (I can't hide shit on my face), she's reading us all (even if only subconsciously) like a book. She has asked to take us out to lunch, and even if my offspring don't respect her in some respects (plenty to talk about here), they need the practice and knowledge. Both young'ns have promised to read the miracle booklet literature; we'll see if they deliver on that. Of course, post-discussion, and what was irrational they picked apart without help. My daughter's requirements are so high, I don't think she understands the implications of it yet, `/nod`. I don't remember shit about the rest of our conversation, but the last leg is EZ street shittalking most of the time anywho. Oh, we did encounter a (and, I'm paraphrasing here) "Lethh go bwandon" bumperstick on a neighbor's vehicle.

My wife came down. //Raw Skintime// as she walked me through her balls-to-wall day. Holy fuck. She has a paper/conference submission and two applications in January now. Good news is that she gets to crib off the conference she attended today (right on the money, a nice coincidence). Still thinking about the last letter sprung on her last minute (which I think is bullshit). Projecting into the future (I think it looks smoother than her instincts feel; as I think significant chunks of this are cakewalk or dreamclass territory anyway). Once the January hump is over, then April/Mays, assuming everything falls into place, I think it will smooth (since she gets to drop a lot of spinning plates since we see no reason to go for L4 any time soon unless it were to fall into her lap). Another task force, asynchronous work, on ILL billing (which she wants to have a serious say in the matter, of course). Gobbled that girl up until she ripped herself away from me (did my best to prevent it).

[[TTTOTW]]. Wife brought down her instrument. Ran a USB extension cable so that the wireless keyboard will work from my bed. I tuned that autoharp (finicky, imho, and I'm glad to have the piano tuning equipment). We played //Canticle of The Turning//, she on her psaltery, and  me on that autoharp (I have no clue what I'm doing). I still like picking on the guitar more, but I'd like to learn the harp.

[[Family Gathering]] with Dev like Savages^^tm^^. [[5c0ut]] had spent many hours cooking throughout the day. I don't know the names of what we ate (though I've eaten similar dishes before). We had those dark Chinese-Thai eggs, some kind of Asian salad slaw, ~~piggy~~ chicken sticks (very much like Thail breakfast, missing only the sticky rice packets), fried rice, ramen with fixins and a dope ass braised mushroom broth (hard salty, drinkable) - as umami as it gets, imho. I had seconds. My brother couldn't, but he's about to get fucked and wants to be clean for his man. I would eat thirds for you, sir, but I don't have room either.<<ref "f">> Dev did most of the speaking for our dinner conversation, which ranged from my girls' topics (I do not understand why they adore these Marvel~~ous~~ stories, and I think I'm going to be sick) to LoL/MTG to politics/sociology. I listened except to offer dead baby jokes and to accept my daughter's merciless killing blows at the table. Listening carefully, as is my job. It was a damned good meal.

We got 8 minutes into the //Foundation// TV show before I was so perturbed I had to turn it off (especially since [[ASK]] is thinkin' about reading them, and the spoilers are ridiculous). We listened to //Hyperion// @ 008-149:00:16. [[TTTOTW]]. Gently making suggestions to Arathorn. Perhaps nothing new to him here. We'll see. `/salute`. Hugs'n'bugs, assignments, bit of help, my daughter went from grumpy to making cutesy jokes in the blink of an eye...I do not understand the mood swings, but I know it is not easy for her, put my wife to bed (she can't even type straight), and pushed brix. [[TTTOTW]].
