//Feels scrappy and disjointed//

Coping. Sitting with it. Holding my boxes of contradictions. I'd rather have the pain, and, damn, it's a special kind of pain at that. Worth. Dependency is expensive. It's beyond trust. A quiet open wound. It's not all a choice anymore, but there is a choice. Once again, I am feeling silent about my feelings (well, almost). I'm not the only one. Wake up every morning thinking and feeling. That's the rumination that won't go away. Alright. As we do. Givin' it time.

Where news is a commodity, reporters are artificially partisan.

Magic box says you did it, therefore you did it.

I don't think I consume so much media because I hate to be alone with my thoughts. I don't consider my surfing an aesthetic pursuit though.

"""
Boss made a dollar
I made a dim,
That was a peom
From a simpler time.

Now Boss makes a thousand
And gives us a cent
While he's got employees
Who can't pay the rent.

So when Boss makes a million
And the workers make jack
Then that's when we riot
And take our lives back.

I don't believe "you work you lose." I'll agree that if you are working on the wrong tasks, then you lose. It is a privilege to work on something beyond one's survival. Yet, there's a survival of one's moral self-constitution that's always at stake.

Hail Xitler, evil or not, your daughter is hawt AF.

Scalp the housing scalpers.

Shots fired, my ninja.

His journals should not be permitted to be read by any, as I think they were not meant to be read. I have never been able to understand what he meant by his life. Why did he care so much about being a writer? Why did he pay so much attention to his own thoughts? Why was he so dissatisfied with everyone else, etc.? Why was he so much interested in the river and the woods and the sky, etc.? Something peculiar, I judge.

Thoreau was aware of the problem—which we might loosely refer to as the pointlessness of the Journal, its lack of a telos—and that it was inseparable from the shift in thinking and writing that the Journal represented for him.

Disinterested writing: writing that lacks “ambition” in Emerson’s sense; that is not for publication but for its own sake, or perhaps, for its subject matter’s sake. 

Thoreau’s Journal is fundamentally nonteleological. This is deeply unsettling because it defies both the notion of artistic intent and the idea of practical purposefulness

Thoreau came to think of the Journal as his central literary enterprise. (Oh shit. plz no. KMN plz. A creature I hate.)

The Journal defies readers and scholars because it refuses to subject nature to any organizing structure or vision, and refuses, in turn, to organize its own prose.

Thoreau’s idea of totality is predicated not on connections but on the breaking of connections. In fact, discontinuity could be described as the Journal’s dominant feature, for no thought is ever entirely jointed to or separated from any other thought. Thoreau’s thoughts seem to be random and going nowhere because nature when viewed unprogrammatically seems to be random and going nowhere. Both the wholeness of nature and the wholeness of the Journal reside in our ignorance of—in the mystery of—the logic that binds their parts.

The Journal belongs to the discipline of natural science. As strange loops do, Nature's Scribe becomes a tool for studying itself. Yes, however tiny, incompletena, and incoherent, it is part of the universe coming to be aware of itself.

Lack of an identifiable purpose to one's contemporaries, but the author sees one. They could all be wrong.

I do confront the claim that The Journal is non-utilitarian and non-teleological. Throwing the fucking gauntlet down at it. Yeah, Romanticized Thoreau (and maybe the man himself) would make that mistake. Loser. Big numbers on my swings, jump through hoops, suck my dick, ???, profit. I get it. One can have an aversion to how most people conceive of instrumentality and telic reasoning while still engaging in the practice, perhaps differently.

I'm fine trying to dissolve my qualia (whatever it menas) as long as I know it's worth it. What's my life [[FTSO]]? Let's be clear: insofar as the text is a dialectical extension of my identity, and insofar as it comprises what part of me is an end in itself (or directly secondary to [[Itself]]), then we have a reason to think it's part of the "its own sake." That doesn't make it sufficiently good, I realize. Just because I have a perspective doesn't make it a worthy one all the way down. There's the exhausting, neverending tension. [[gfwiwcgws]]. 

My gut instinct is that Thoreau saw his journal and the world as being useful to him ("they do me good"), and he maybe served no one or nothing but himself. He's just {[[Focus]]}ing on himself, right? True 'Murican right there. World as Representation of The Will To Power. It is expensive to know what it means to care about anything or anyone as much as yourself (and hence more than yourself). It's a painful grind with bright spots, like any function.

Yes, an honest journal reveals what we treasure, again, and again, and again. 

Do I treasure spending my life well? Treasuring what's up to me eventually ought to target treasuring what is not up to me (and, yeah, if you are reading this: I treasure you). The [[Stoic]]s failed. We have to eat it. Hao 2 Risk.

Still trying to put words to it, you simpmonke. [[/b/]]'s wheel-spinning infection almost seems complete.

Thoreau tries to see each natural phenomenon as belonging to a self-sufficient order of being, hence, as incapable of being lifted out of its context and into that of any humanly conceived and constructed order. But, surely, this is true of anything. This is the Thing-In-Itself representation problem too.

[p]erhaps I can never find so good a setting for my thoughts as I shall thus have  taken them out of
