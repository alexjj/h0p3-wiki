* k0sh3k
** My sleep was off this week.
** Dizziness. 
* h0p3
** Trying to fix my sleep schedule. It might be working. Tons of rumination. Tolerance break was alright. Gonna still go easy since I really want my sleep schedule set correctly, but we'll see.
* ASK
** my lymphatic system is making dire threats, but I am the boss and it can STFU. I had a couple of mental breakdowns, only one of which was drug induced. Sleep is chaotic and difficult. Enough anxiety to fuel space exploration.

!! What was interesting to you last week?

* Beinecke was pretty cool. Pitazikis was insane.
* [[D2]] rocked. (Druids still rock)
* [[The Book of Impassionata]] is, like, so Peak ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±
* Our neighbor doesn't really want to connect at all. Old man seems to have had enough of our species.
* Lightning & Thunder
* Aether is back up and running.
* The Beinecke was amazing and I am truly privileged to have been able to see it.
* You know it, you hate and/or love it, the Beinecke.
* Obligatory Beinecke mention. Also, now running a pilot program at work and also on an advisory board for my MLIS alma mater.
* Running cameras at church was fun!

!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family (including ourselves)?

* 1uxb0x
** I am fairly good at learning new things.
** Thank you for finding me the snowball cakes - they are delicious!
** You've picked up on the concepts of the [[D2]] pally builds and reasons quickly. I'm [[grateful]] that you weigh the opportunity to play with us, and I'm having a blast with you.
** When you are bored and done with some activity that you are forced to participate in, you're kind and patient. Also, I enjoy chillin' with you in those times especially (we often share preferences there too); you make it less lonely.
** it's incredibly fun talking politics with you. :)
** Thank you for your patience with me while playing Diablo. I appreciate it. I have really enjoyed playing with you.
* j3d1h
** i'm getting more confident about my art and design choices.
** I love your sense of style, and that you apply it to character design as well as your own outfits. I enjoyed discussing costume design with you yesterday, too.
** When you decide to dive in: you adjust to new platforms very easily.
** I'm glad that you try to befriend your friends' other friends. That is friendly.
** You can make my day.
** I am glad we have had more chances to talk this week. I had been missing you.
* k0sh3k
** I did some more photography; I don't know why I haven't been doing more. Anyway, I took some nice pictures!
** Thank you for planning the trip this weekend. We had a great time. It was a nice trial trip for the summer one.
** Thank you for thinking about the yard and trees. You work to make [[The Alien Asylum]] live up to its name.
** You're patient with all the people you work with who cannot or choose not to write well.
** thanks for taking us out to the beinecke!
** Thank you for helping us make rosaries.
** Thank you for the marvelous family outing! It was a gift and a jewel for my memories.
* h0p3
** My necro corpse explosions are, like, so big, yo. I'm alright at binding us together with fun shit sometimes.
** Thank you for meeting with [[5c0ut]]. I appreciate it; and I know he does, too. You are patient and care a lot for people who are trying to pull things together.
** i've enjoyed chilling downstairs while y'all game.
** Thank you for giving me good philosophical lenses (I have yet to need actual glasses luckily.)
** Being allowed to be near you is satisfying in ways that have been neglected my entire life.
* ASK
** It's a joy watching you engage in science, from cooking to [[vidya]] [[games]], and moar.
** Thank you for planning with me, big things and small.
** I've never been so excited about a yard before. I'm beginning to see your vision. Labyrinth sounds especially dope. I like how you aim to waste nothing and work with what you've got.
** I appreciate how much work you put into your self-control. I think it's difficult for people to understand what you're going through, and you do a good job.
** I adore how much you like Abed. It means a lot to me.
** Thank you for the special pizza; I don't like pizza, generally speaking, but what you made was tasty.
*** yus!
** I think it's neat to live with a crafty person-if you ever need help with some project, I'd love to help!
** When you lose your shit, you generally find a way to do it usefully, if not always completely constructively. Keep that up.
** i adore the garden plans so far. :]
