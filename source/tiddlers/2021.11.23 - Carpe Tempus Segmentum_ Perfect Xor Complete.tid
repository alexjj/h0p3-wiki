title: 2021.11.23 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Perfect Xor Complete

//Skintime// & Rabbitholing with [[ASK]]. //One Piece// + Massage. Sleep by 3.

Woke at 9. Solid. Long meditation. Smelling my own farts to get them back inside me. Fireman Time! //Skintime// with [[ASK]]. [[TTTOTW]]. Fruit leather + jerky + water. [[Morning Routine]]. Hugs'n'bugs (daughter is rude and unpleasant this morning, `/salute`). [[TTTOTW]] + chips'n'dip. People are planning for T-day. 

[[ASK]] brought a gazebo frame, and we finished putting it up with her.

[[k0sh3k]]: He's EASY, just NEEDY.

[[ASK]] gave me rock-candy dark chocolate. Tears for the texture, of course. Offspring and I prepped in the kitchen. A long list of things for desserts for those who wish to make them for a day in which I will continue to argue we should just get Chinese or Pizza (`/beg`), but, no, this is our time to celebrate our domestication + exploitation and to be thankful that we have the ability to make all these delicious things that I am going to enjoy. Prep for dinner with losers. 

[[JRE]] called me up. New shift sucks because it's kinda creepy being out in the middle of nowhere at night, cold AF. [[Rb]] is holding up so far. Work is slow to his eyes, but I think it's a good thing that they aren't going balls out and have enough for emergencies (that is what I would want to pay taxes for). I do see his point though, as even with the cross-training, his mind is underused (but, this was was always going to be true...his doctor was correct about this). [[Q]] is talking (his "hi" to me was legit!). [[Bn]] got punished for fuckin' up the screen. Since [[Rb]] is in school but not working, social worker has taken away the funding for childcare. However, they can take an annual $14k hit and still have plenty. He used to argue that the privileged should be sending their offspring to public schools, but is shooting for private pre to autoaccept into the magnet. He's picked up a $300 4k screen and gonna protect with acrylic or something. 

It was too cold for us to enjoy walking again. Pansies. We stayed in [[The Den]] and talked instead. Daughter talked with me about Ratox, [[2021.11.17 - HN Log: Arathorn & P2P Matrix]], CRDTs, Multi-device problems in P2P networks, and [[Rust]] CLI tooling. My son isn't convinced he's set, but he's close on his project. We went up to the commons to work on a craft (we busted out my craft paper that I will be using as wrapping paper because it's cool). Memes cut, pasted, painted over. They've got the oil painting look that triggers my HPPD (not sure what to call it). Ghetto, but I like it. [[k0sh3k]] played music for us as we finished.

//Skintime// + //One Piece// with [[ASK]]. [[TTTOTW]]. A Chess Network.

//Skintime// with mi amor in her room. Party went well, and apparently the cleaning up will be a twice a year thing (J dodged her bullet :P). 

[[Family Gathering]] was outstanding. We had ribs, wedges, pineapple, sprouts, water (I'm a fan of heavy seasoning). Watched the opening Tritter episode. //Skintime// with mi amor.

Put mi amor to bed. She's exhausted. She needs her time.

//Skintime// with [[ASK]]. Swept by a blue moment, but it got better. //One Piece//. Fell asleep at 11? Dog tired.
