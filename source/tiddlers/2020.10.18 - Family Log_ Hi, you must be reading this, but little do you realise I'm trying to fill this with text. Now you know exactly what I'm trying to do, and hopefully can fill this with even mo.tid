title: 2020.10.18 - Family Log: Hi, you must be reading this, but little do you realise I'm trying to fill this with text. Now you know exactly what I'm trying to do, and hopefully can fill this with even more text. As you know, changing subjects is very hard to do, I hate it, on that topic, I also hate some writing! On the topic of writing I have terrible grammar in my writing. Grammar is annoying, and often people are judged based on that. I wish that we could make grammar simpler and less important. At the end of this, you will see how stupid it was that you read this whole thing, you also have to deal with how many commas there're. I like many a neat words like I'd've. Words are pretty neat in some cases, but some are pretty annoyingly long, there're people who fear long words, a fear called Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia. There, I said it, and this may or may not be the end...surprise! It's not! Did you know that there's a thing in repair work called stuff, and it's not just general stuff. There is 4 types of stuff, one is insulating stuff, one is stuff for large spaces, one is stuff for small spaces, and one for something, I forget at the moment. Anyway, this may or may not be the end...Surprise! It is!

!! Write a paragraph summarizing each person's week:

*** Math is a failure, infact, all my work is a failure. I had an okay week. I'm having my networking removed, so you'll stop seeing these messages on discord for the second or third time. My dreams have been games-even on days were I haven't played that game, and most of those dreams have been me playing the game itself. I mostly notice dreams on days where I am interrupted when I have been asleep or when I don't get too great sleep.

*** I'm liking your carpe diem logs a lot (not just this week, but last week and the one before, too)! You have a lot more detail in them than you used to. I think you should totally keep going with your ability to make such great characters in such short amounts of time. It will come in handy, especially with more people to talk to about these things! Do make sure you write your math process out more cleanly, though. Try paragraph form, or variables, maybe?
** k0sh3k
*** I hope you'll work on presenting your math proofs better; I can't see your process in your writing. I also hope you'll not slip more and will keep working hard to get all your work done every day. I had fun talking to you about the Olmecs, though - it seems like you were really excited about them. I hope your new engineering textbook work for you; it seems good, so far. You did a good job following along with the inspector yesterday and paying attention to what he said; you also engaged in some serious conversations with the realtor. I like that you're growing into a polite and serious young man!

*** [[1uxb0x]] was not honest this week, and even his work for his mother wasn't complete (let alone having done nothing for his father). That sucks. He did have plenty to speak about on walks though. He played in his head and on his machines plenty. He's been writing privately more. The home inspection was fun with him. He needs a new pair of boots.

** 1uxb0x
*** You and I had a good week with eachother. It's funny that, like father with mom, I bug you to talk to you. Thank you for comforting me when I'm unhappy. Thank you for talking a lot more with me than normal this week.  
** j3d1h
*** I've been very demotivated this week. I could have sworn I wrote more for school, but maybe I just didn't. I can't bring myself to draw much (despite how badly I want to draw), and roleplaying doesn't appeal to me, either. Making Lucas and Fawn was pretty easy, so I might try more of that. Writing some character sketches (now I know what they're //really// called) would be good practice? I think I need to meditate more often, and probably take fewer naps.
** k0sh3k
*** I'm really disappointed in your wiki again this week; I don't know how to motivate you to do your work in your wiki. For the subjects you did write about, I'm particularly upset about your elective; you record the exercises but don't actually //do// them. I'd like to see you try them out. It seems like something you'd really enjoy, you'd learn a lot from it, and it could turn into a bigger story later. I did like walking through the house with you during inspection yesterday and thinking about how to use the space. I was surprised that you chose the smallest room, but I think your reasoning was very interesting. 
** h0p3
*** [[j3d1h]] wrote for two of her mother's subjects, and not even completely at that. She continues to choose to waste her life, and I'm going to let her fail. It will simply be a haunting then. She is free to do otherwise. She had lots of fun with her friends this weekend. She enjoyed speaking her brother. Cooking has been on her mind more. She looks a lot older in her warm clothes, especially with her hat.

*** It sucks that you can't have stevia, why would father do this? Thank you for giving us the flavoring. Thank you for making sure we get a good home. I hope we are around for when you get more cats.
** j3d1h
*** I can hardly believe it's been a year since you first visited Yale! Oddly enough, it feels like no time has passed at all, but also insanely distant. Please don't become allergic to lemon/lime juice, because then you won't be able to find //any// food. Your last AFF was very good, I'm glad you did these in the first place. I'm sorry you're still getting headaches all the time.
** k0sh3k
*** I have learned I can't have stevia, which is sad, but I am looking forward to fewer headaches this week. I've been watching a lot of Elementary; I have decided that Sherlock Holmes is my favorite fictional character ever. While Benedict Cumberbatch remains my favorite incarnation of Holmes, I can appreciate Jonny Lee Miller's version, too, and I love that Holmes and Joan Watson are good friends and partners with zero romantic entanglements. It was a busy week - I didn't get an RCL done this week. I'm going to miss working from home in the mornings, but maybe I'll like working from home in the afternoons better, anyway. I'm looking forward to MeeScan implementation! It's been a year since my on-site interview at Yale; it seems not so long ago and also forever ago. I'm so glad I took the chance!

*** [[k0sh3k]] continued her science experiments on her body (putting the "S" in MLIS), and it made for a rough set of migraines. Cutting back on sugar sucks. I hate to see her not take Vitamin D, especially with CV19, but sometimes she has to take a break. She's been a relatively good spirits though, and she's had serious vegg-time. The inspection and hiccups with the appraisal weighed on her, but she seems optimistic. We've enjoyed thinking about a home with roots and a basement and so forth; maybe it will happen. It also feels like I've had more time with her than usual this week, and that's been a blessing. Holding her while the world seems to crumble is not easy to put into words. Work continues to calm down and hit a groove (even with all the changes still occurring [it's all insane anyway]). We have made a deal that if we get a house, we will wait to get more cats until Ranga and Meow die (can't be soon enough, of course), and then she can get 3 kittens at the same time (solves problems). There aren't many people in the world I want to spend my time with; she is a goddess.

*** I think we had a week. I am surprised at your lack of stuff in the week. If and when we leave home, I wonder when you'll stop the wiki. You stab yourself in the back by leaving questions for you that you don't like. You have a sick sense of humor, in many a way.
** j3d1h
*** Your clock RP prompt was actually very cool! In terms of roleplaying, it's not your finest work, I think. Your voice is still very clearly there, when there was room to build this clock a personality. Still I love the final paragraph's detail! Also, nice greentext, I'm glad you figured out the `<span>` mechanics all on your own. In the end, it's unfortunate you're so smart, because you only seem to waste it thinking about sex.
** k0sh3k
*** Your PI on the clock is weirdly cool. You didn't write as much this week; what were you doing? I think we had more skintime than usual this week, but I don't know that it was //that// much more. You need to quit dairy, I swear. I've really enjoyed verbal sparring with you this week - I mean, I always enjoy it, but it seems like we did more of it this week. I know you said you left me a line, but I found several of them: you're lucky I like arrogant, intelligent men; I'm not going to do my boss; I am not a dominatrix. Stahppit. I enjoyed walking with you so much, and I liked watching Reality Bites with you, too.
** h0p3
*** [[h0p3]] wrote less, felt pretty jaded by much of his reading, but enjoyed being an animal this week. It's been a wind-down kind of week. He was lucky to walk and talk with loved ones. Cannabliss wasn't hit so hard this week, and it's not clear why. There's been some thrilling parts of the week, and while there have been low points, none hard to bear. School sucked, but it's not up so much up to him anymore.
