You: Hi.

You: I won't be doing that.

Stranger: Going good friend

Stranger: Hmm

You: Is school going smoothly for you?

Stranger: No

You: Oh.

Stranger: Online

You: What do you think about online classes?

Stranger: Just boring online class

You: Seems difficult to make one that is engaging.

Stranger: What is your age friend

You: I am 35.

Stranger: Ok

You: Ancient for this website.

Stranger: Are you in Instagram

Stranger: Oo that's good

You: Nope. I have attempted to make an anonymized account, but they don't care for that so much (I didn't try very hard). However, you can find my web presence here: https://philosopher.life/. (It may take quite a while to load).

You: You use insta a lot?

Stranger: Yeah

Stranger: How you know

You: How do I know what?

Stranger: Nothing

Stranger: Are you in Instagram

You: Oh, well, yes, I often know nothing.

Stranger: Ok

You: No. I don't use it.

You: I have some problems with the site.

Stranger: This site

You: They continue to wall it off, don't seem to care about users owning their data or their relationships with each other.

Stranger: Ok

You: "this" one being omegle? I use it once in a while. I've used it more in the past week than I probably ever have. That link I gave you, that's to my website.

You: It's a reasonable replacement for instagram, though it lacks pictures for the most part.

Stranger: Ha

You: What brings you to omegle?

Stranger: My friend prefers

Stranger: Me

Stranger: Who are you

Stranger has disconnected.

I am an idiot. =). My name is h0p3.
