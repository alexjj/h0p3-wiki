title: 2021.02.03 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: K 4 Bro

* Try To Take Over The World
* Fireman Time!
* Chips + LoL
* Sleep by 4
* Woke at 8:30
* AFireman Time!
* Try To Take Over The World
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Offspring set on task
* Cleaning & Organizing
** Fixed my hidden book
** Slow going. I have lots of little things. Will be good to have it back together and know where everything belongs.
* [[MTG]] with my son, his Affinity 0, +1 vs MUC
** Impressive inferences on his part. Sandbagging against possible drains instead of going hyperaggro (I lost a full fucking turn for that brilliant out-of-the-blue guess), slowrolling me as I'm screwed for blowing stone (no pro would do that; only someone who had practiced this exact matchup far too much would even guess at something that odd). He has called my mana screw every time for the past few games before missing a drop too. Not his fault that his MUC build is broken and forgiving (I made a couple errors, imo). He's not guessing my full hand yet, but that will happen.
*** He's watching the cards in my hand, knows when I'm playing off the top, even with compulsive hand-shuffling and moving fast.
**** Only a ~~sociopath~~ serious player is going to look at a magician's hands instead of their eyes in those moments. Good job. I adore the way you search for information.
*** He doesn't have the fast-paced draw/go speed yet. Never had to play under time constraints before. But, he's exceptionally aware of even my tiny pauses, guessing constantly why I would even pause for a second. He gives me no space.
**** Now, it's time to learn a real skill, son. Cmon, lol. =) You can become virtuous at this, but virtuous for what, in virtue of what, [[FTSO]], [[gfwiwcgws]]? [[Rust]], sir. Please. Or take those social skills to the next level.
***** Well, I'm glad we get to play. It's a great practice for us.
* Bro called Costco to confirm they had the shelves
* Laundry
* More snow shoveling. 
* Drove to Costco: they did not. Still, we got noodles and a hotdog.
* Installed showerhead and got a mat for our feet (tracking so much into the house).
* Tripsat my bro.
** He really wanted to try K again. He has a much higher tolerance for all substances than I have. A heroic dose for me, and he was still able to sit up. I have no idea how he does it. He had a good trip.
* Bugged my offspring
* Try To Take Over The World
* Fireman Time!
* //Skintime//
** No way she had energy to bang. 98% chance of getting hard, but at least I'm not in agony. 
* Nap, sweet sleep.
* She's agitated. Hates trying to get ready for bed while I'm in it. 
* Held her until she slept. She woke up, thought she hadn't even fallen asleep. Second night. Her anxiety is higher. 
** This class is taking its toll too (ridiculous amounts of busywork...and, she's loves to work hard, but she knows when she's working on something that doesn't actually matter...and that's extra draining, feels like the energy is being flushed down the toilet, and then it costs even more). I feel her worry in general. She's dogtired today, ded, alone time isn't even enough for her to recoup. Reading bad fiction isn't helping enough. 2021 hasn't slowed down yet.
*** Hrm. Maybe a period.
* [[m16]] froze! No SSH. Memory leak in FF is my bet.
* Wrote to my ᛝLightᛝ.
