title: 2020.04.25 - Prompted Introspection: I'm A Dad

!! Describe something you feel passionate about to a complete stranger.

I've toned the question down from [[2018.08.11 - Prompted Introspection: Passionate]]. This is an elevator speech prompt, and now it has a larger scope. 

I'm passionate about raising and homeschooling my offspring, [[1uxb0x]] & [[j3d1h]], [[WINTCIS]]. I'm similar to a retarded version of [[Captain Fantastic]]. It is one of my {[[Axioms]]} to [[Be A Good Dad]], [[WINTCIS]]. I have the privilege of spending my life with them in a way few dads in the 21st Century WEIRD-world choose to do. I have already spent more direct time with my offspring than most parents in similar shoes do over the course of their lifetimes. We haven't wasted our time either. I do not know what the future holds for them, and so we race in the desert. I am showing them every landmark, tool, tactic, and strategy I know. I hand lenses that no other children have had from such a young age. Who knows what they will do with what they have (perhaps nothing, lol, I have no idea). They may find my method absurd, but they know I try. Optimistically, perhaps we are like Fedaykin, wrestlers in [[Saint Plato]]'s lineage, skiddie lifehackers, and {[[I|About]]} [[hope]] [[good]] persons. We can never be superheroes, but we should generally try.
