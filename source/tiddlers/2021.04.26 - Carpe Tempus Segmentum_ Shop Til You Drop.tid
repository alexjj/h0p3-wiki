title: 2021.04.26 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Shop Til You Drop

Woke at 3:30. Meditation. Fireman Time! LolVod+chips. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! x2. [[TTTOTW]].

Offspring were on task! Daughter was grumpy. We played a match, then swapped decks. I had noodles, dried fruit, and coffee. Games ended fast. She's at least 25% of her deck off, though she had precious little time to build it. We had fun. Sharp tongues.

[[TTTOTW]] and canvassing.

Match with my son. Now that I know his deck, there's nothing he can do unless he draws a god hand to my shit mulls. We need to draft again. After the game, I gave him my bookstand. Would fit his desk and his workload nicely.

Shopping @ Costco. I didn't realize my wife wanted to go. Oops. Well, we bought a ton of non-perishables in bulk. I got lots of noodles for my offspring too. 

Planted our magnolia right next to where an old tree used to be. It'll be right outside her window. Might need to shape it over the years, and it needs water now. Put up a little protection dohickey. 

Shopping @ Aldi. Bought everything else, except I forgot mints for my son. 

Chat. [[Shah]] also uses the word "Preach." Yeah. =D. It's pretty standard for me to actively listen and explore someone else's point of view without reciprocation. I know it's expensive to actually engage me on what I think is important though. I aim to be fittingly useful.

She came down, //Skintime//, thought about her action-packed day, Inform the Men!  Fell asleep like any reasonable male. Day hit me like a truck, and I was out.
