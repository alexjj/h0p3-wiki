//In which I confirm my [[bias]]. Imagine not actually caring about anyone but yourself because most people do the same. This is what most humans really are, anti-social^^tm^^; including avoiding speaking with strangers they don't benefit from, some are just much better at hiding it (from [[others]] and themselves). With one exception, utterly broken conversations with bored narcissists. Don't predict anyone will like you or give you the time of day. The world, like, owes you nothing, man; therefore, neither do I. So, in your #notlikealltheotherincels "grindset" self-psyop, just make sure that you get yours, okay killionaire? Bickle, Durden, Bateman, Joker...society's indifference personified, but deep down, you know you can stand seemingly alone against society with integrity and moral merit instead. Status and signaling don't have to be mere masks, nihilistic constructions, and exploitation. Of course, who wants to be present without a toxically positive illusion? I continue sifting. It is a rare opportunity to find those who deserve to live, let alone happiness. At the very least, I can serve them indirectly in dealing with everyone else.//

You're now chatting with a random stranger. Say STAND WITH HONG KONG AGAINST THE CCP!

Stranger: Hey

Stranger: K

Stranger: Age?

You: Hello

Stranger: M*

You: 35/M

You: You?

You: I have a lot of people drop off with me at this point in the conversation.

The perils of anonymity. At least it tends to be more honest.

I could offer to jack them off, but I think it's better to shame idiots instead.

You: Think everyone is cruising here.

Stranger: hahaha

Stranger: i guess u r m right

You: That is correct.

You: You?

You: My daughter is 15.

Stranger has disconnected.

Like grindr, one must grind through the sea of dark-triads to find [[gem]]s. Sifting through the dregs. We can argue this is all they are doing as well, but I'm here to speak with the person in front of me.

You: So many captchas.

Stranger: Lol

You: This place is crawling with bots tonight.

You: What brings you here?

Stranger: Yeah lol

Stranger: Horny basically

You: Lol. Yup. I think that is common.

You: Do you find any sources of relief here?

Stranger: Dude?

You: I am a dude. Yes.

Stranger has disconnected.

Perhaps I'm just not understanding the real pull of sexting. I mean, one can definitely be sexy in words, and I adore erotic fiction, but I don't understand cyborz.

You: Are you here to fuck!?!?!?!

Stranger has disconnected.

Maybe not. See, the goal is to only be so direct about what we want without admitting that we don't really give a shit about them. That's what this is all about, man.

You: https://philosopher.life/#monster-16

You: What you doing on this crazy website?

Stranger: just bored u

You: Ah, finding [[anon]]s to speak with.

You: I consider it an honor and a pleasure to speak with the people I find.

You: What do you do for fun?

You: When you aren't here*

Stranger: lol i do poms

Stranger: hng w friends

Stranger: normal stuff ig

You: what's a pom?

You: Like the dance?

Stranger: kinda like cheerleading

Stranger: but more dance

You: cool

You: Dance is good for you. Helps with memory quite a bit.

You: You make good friendships in poms?

Stranger: yea some of my best friends

You: Is it a difficult practice? Do you have to coordinate a lot with others?

Stranger: yea we work a lot

You: What makes IG fun?

Stranger: huh?

You: Nm*

You: IG as in "I Guess"

You: (I'm not "with it" these days...my acronyms are all mixed up)

Stranger: Lol

Stranger: how old r u?

You: I am 35yo.

You: Gettin' ancient.

You: I'm from the 1900's as my daughter likes to say.

Stranger: oh ok

Stranger: Lol

Stranger: how old is she?

You: She is 15yo. https://philosopher.life/#j3d1h

You: She has her own wiki (https://theta.wiki).

You: She likes to draw and spends a ton of time with people Discord.

You: You ever use that platform?

Stranger: oh ok

Stranger: no

You: It's an interesting place.

You: (long ago, she used to visit omegle more often too...very different kind of crowd here)

You: How do you like your family?

You: (many don't*, obviously)

Stranger: fine...its family lol

You: You get to eat dinner with them often? What do you like to do with them?

Stranger: well my parents are divorced

You: Do you get to see both parents often? You have siblings that you get to hang out with?

Stranger: yeah...see them both

Stranger: live w my mom, stepdad, older sister & stepbro

You: Noice. I grow to appreciate my siblings more and more as I get older.

You: Sometimes they are the only people who understand our stories.

You: I've got two brothers.

You: [[JRE]] and [[AIR]] (these are links to their pages on my ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±, if you wanted to see).

Stranger: cool

You: Does your sister do poms as well?

Stranger: no

Stranger: she home from collegefor the summer

You: Cool. She enjoying it?

Stranger: yea

You: You hoping to attend yourself when you become almost ancient as well?

Stranger: lol yea

You: What do you like to study?

You: In your freetime, what do you enjoy learning about? (sometimes, schools can be prisons*)

Stranger: i like art...so maybe do something w that

Stranger: idk

You: [[Art]]'s dope. Hard to know where to go with it, perhaps.

You: What kind of art are you into? Poms, obviously*

You: (Do you study other kinds of dance?)

Stranger: No

Stranger: Just do poms

You: Hard to pick out what my favorite types of art might be. I usually have mixture of reading, music, and video each day. I try for things like making good food (I'm not a good cook; at best, it is safe to eat).

You: Always wanted to try making a bonsai tree, but never get past just the thought of it.

You: So, what makes for an amusing conversation for you here on Omegle?

Stranger: idk...whatever

Stranger: boys usually always talk about sex üòÇ

Stranger: or want to lol

You: That is often the case.

You: I'd argue that over the years, everyone I know is more willing to talk about the topic. It's less taboo.

Stranger: yea ig

You: I know it can be hard (no pun intended) to think about anything else with raging hormones.

Stranger: Lol

Stranger: pretty sure thats all boys think about

You: The world is radically shaped by sexual desire, in unintuitive ways.

You: Meh.

You: #notallboys

Stranger: it was all my ex thought about lol

You: Well, hunt around. You'll find plenty who have far more on their minds than sex (though, I agree that the majority will still think about sex often).

Stranger: ok just most boys lol

You: Well, there's a difference between "thats all boys think about" and "that's one of the thing most boys think about."

You: (you'll have to forgive me, I'm ultra picky about my words...drives the people around me insane)

Stranger: lol its ok

You: Who drives you insane in this world?

Stranger: its fine sometimes some boys are just sex and only sex lol

You: Shoot for depth (again, no pun intended). What do you wish boys would think more about?

Stranger: idk...u?

You: Oh, I'm absolutely retarded. My list is very, very long.

You: I wish boys, girls, and everyone else thought about how to be good persons. That's a very expensive task.

You: (and, admittedly, thinking about sex is part of flourishing, of course)

You: As to your generation, I'm worried that you've got monumental tasks in front of you. You've got huge problems to solve in the world (and so do I, obviously).

Stranger: Yea it is fun lol

You: I think reading and writing, learning to own one's computers, participating in politics, finding a way to save the planet, and helping those in need (especially when they can't help you back) would be a good start for what to look for.

You: Btw, do you have any links to cool sites, or videos, or things that are interesting or important?

You: I'm a link addict.

You: I collect them, like a dragon.

Stranger has disconnected.

She's aimlessly cruising (and, I suppose, to some [[dok]], we all are). I [[hope]] she finds her way.

Stranger: Haiii

You: Hello

You: What brings you to omegle this fine day?

Stranger: Nothing in particular to be honest with you, what brings you here?

You: Asking myself that this past half hour, lol.

You: I want to meet other people. Speak with what is alien to me.

You: Try to understand our species.

You: People sometimes reveal themselves with [[anonymity]] as their mask.

You: https://philosopher.life/#Anonymous

Stranger: Hmm?

You: That's my pile of words. You'll see me [[Link]]ing to it in our conversation (ignore it at-will).

Stranger: Oohh

You: I think Omegle is a special platform. Different from an online forum. We get to speak to each [[other]] face-to-face somewhat.

Stranger: Yeah, itbis

Stranger: It‚Äôs interesting

Stranger: Everyone here is anonymous too

You: Indeed, or they initially have something like it.

You: The [[vidya]] sharing is direct, from one user's IP to another. So, that gives up some information.

You: Plenty of people spam their kiks and so forth.

Stranger: Yeah, unfortunately

You: And, others leak their information in other ways, in my experience.

You: Wish I had a way to sift through the spam.

You: The a/s/l opener gets old.

You: What do you like to read when you aren't on this very classy website. =)

You: ?*

Stranger: I‚Äôll read manifestos in my free time

Stranger: Or just code

You: Oh, dope.

Stranger: It‚Äôs infuriating sometimes

You: I'm a linkslut. Need my dopamine hit. You got any links to manifestos or code?

You: Oh, no doubt.

Stranger: The unabomber manifesto is one I‚Äôm currently reading

Stranger: You can find the PDF online

You: It is unfortunate that he gets anything right.

You: I can see through the cracks of the madness and find someone who actually kinda tried to understand the fuck is so wrong with the world.

Stranger: The world is fucked, yeah

Stranger: Half the time what you see is fake or just watered down

You: Reminds me of the Debord feller.

You: https://philosopher.life/#Deh%20Ga%20Buh%2C%20Gi%20Duh%20Bo%2C%20Megiddo

You: It's a spectacle.

You: What are you lookin' for in the end?

Stranger: Currently on mobile so I can‚Äôt open it rn

You: Oh, no worries*

Stranger: Really, just a life I didn‚Äôt regret

You: lmao

You: One that you would be willing to live again and again, given the opportunity, maybe.

Stranger: Yeah, exactly

You: You got any people in your life that make it worth living?

Stranger: Family and my girlfriend, some of my friends too

You: Noice.

You: Hard to regret that.

Stranger: You‚Äôre the first person I‚Äôve met here who actually seems like they‚Äôre intellectual

You: Oh, well, I'm also full-blown retarded*. That is my disclaimer. Lol.

You: I'm just tryin' to figure it out.

You: Lookin' at the world, not sure hao 2 solve some of these gigantic problems.

You: Including the sort that unabomber feller picked out.

Stranger: Way I see it, we‚Äôve gone too far

You: Too far in what direction?

Stranger: Really just everything

You: I know that feel.

Stranger: Everything is just‚Ä¶ Weird

Stranger: Weird is a basic word but it describes a lot of it

You: It's an interesting word choice.

You: It's not necessarily bad or wrong or even ugly for something to be weird or not the norm.

You: The World definitely feels off though.

You: What kinds of code do you like to work on or read?

Stranger: I‚Äôve tried Python and some JavaScript but it doesn‚Äôt ever work for some reason

Stranger: Mainly modding shit

You: Oh, hell yeah. Those are important languages. I can imagine they'd be useful for some kinds of modding too.

You: You like to [[game]]?

Stranger: Oh also got Discord?

Stranger: Yes I do

You: Funny you should ask. I'm in the process of scraping out the servers that I'm on (even in parallel, it's slow). I'll be scrubbing my account afterward, and deleting it.

Stranger: Ah

You: I've very strong feelings and opinions about the tools we use to communicate.

You: But, you can reach me!

You: I definitely would [[love]] to continue our conservation. https://philosopher.life/#Contact%20h0p3

You: What games you [[like]] to play? How does modding appeal to you?

Stranger: Mainly Minecraft and older games from around 2004

You: `/nod`. Indeed. MC is dope.

You: I've very fond memories of it with my offspring, [[j3d1h]] and [[1uxb0x]].

Stranger: Children?

You: Indeed. Two of 'em. I try to [[Be A Good Dad]]. It's quite a task.

Stranger: Must be

You: They adore [[computing]] and [[games]] (and Discord too!).

Stranger: Huh, interesting. I‚Äôd love to be a father someday

You: It's hard to do these days. Even just surviving as an individual is a ridiculous task in capitalism. Birth rates are plummeting in the developed world (faster than the usual we see in denser populations too).

You: I started having my offspring at 19. Back when I was far more optimistic about the world and my place in it.

Stranger: Really? Huh, I thought they were going up

Stranger: 19? Damn

You: Yeah. Well, I'm a weird dude. XD. Always wanted to be a dad.

You: My wife is significantly older.

You: It seemed to make good sense.

Stranger: Yeah, I guess so

You: (I had already graduated colllege*)

Stranger: What‚Äôd you get a degree in if I may ask?

You: Philosophy.

Stranger: Thought so

You: That's what I did in grad school too.

Stranger: So the philosophy website, does it have users that you can talk with?

You: Well, it's hard to describe everything about it (it's self-documented, very thoroughly).

You: It's a Tiddlywiki.

Stranger: Hmm‚Ä¶

You: It's ~45MB in size, almost pure text. I have Geschwind Syndrome. I write a lot (a lot a lot).

You: There are many conversations on it.

You: [[Find The Others]] is one of my tasks I run.

You: Some folks are willing to spend their time reading and writing quite extensively with me, usually with mixed communications tooling. Sometimes we just speak from our sites to each other. My [[Root User]], Sir [[kickscondor]] calls it "blogchatting."

Stranger: I should probably sleep. You can add em on Disocrd if you want

You: Aight, sleep well!

You: It was a pleasure meeting you.

Stranger: Alr, my tag is ThisDoesNotExist#0001. If you don‚Äôt want to ig it wa great talking with you

You: Tox and Session are the tools I use for instant messaging.

You: `/salute`.

Stranger: Alr man, cya :)

Stranger: Do you want me to end it

You: If you want. I'm chillin'.

You: I can leave this on, if you want.

Stranger: Is good. I‚Äôll check out that site

You: Not sure if they autokick us.

Stranger: Maybe

Stranger: Alr well anyways I‚Äôll cya whenever I do
