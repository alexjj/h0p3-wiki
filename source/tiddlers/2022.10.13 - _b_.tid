On Conflict Propagation: Conflict between B and C forces A to take sides. If A sides with B, then conflict between A and C forces D to take sides. If D sides with A instead of C, it prevents conflict from arising in the rest of the network, but if D sides with A it will force E to take sides and so on. Having more ties increases an agentâ€™s probability of forming even more ties, but it also increases the probability that a conflict between two agents will spread throughout the network, as their decision to side on any side of the conflict can spiral downward. Just as there is a critical mass that causes tie density to grow exponentially, there is also a critical mass value on the upper end of density (self-organized criticality) that prevents it from growing further because the increased density leads to greater conflicts that bring the density back down. Similarly, the more dense a forest is, the greater the catastrophe. This is why permitting smaller fires sometimes down-regulates the density of the forest to ensure that most fires are well contained.

I'd like to see prediction markets where we could programmatically wield weighted votes, especially in light of evidence of a voter's proximity to some particulars or other reputation signals. Eliminating bad faith actors will always remain a hard problem.

Socialist Shares: the more work one has put in (including the value of one's comparative advantage [we can still use market signaling to aid us here]), the more voice tokens one should receive.

~12 years in, and the self-driving vehicle industry is still claiming it's eventually coming. Seems to me that, at least in the eyes of those in [[power]] and given the problems of the appearance of disposability, only the poorest areas on the planet and contexts of warfare provide "acceptable" accidental losses of life, hence, warfare will be where we continue to see the most real world use for now.

Beyond the USMIC's enforcement, the continued weaponization of the USD itself may eventually lead to a conversion of what has been propping it up, a shift from confidence to fear.
