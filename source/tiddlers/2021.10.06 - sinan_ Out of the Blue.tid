"""
[18:31:22] sinan: Hi :)
[18:32:17] h0p3: Hello. =)
[18:32:50] sinan: Finally I am here!
[18:33:18] h0p3: Yes, sir. I appreciate the opportunity. It's been a long time coming, assuming we've not met before.
[18:33:32] h0p3: This is me: https://philosopher.life/
[18:33:47] h0p3: You don't have to [[share]] anything with me. I'm glad to meet you.
[18:33:50] sinan: I appreciate it finally meeting you!
[18:34:05] sinan: I was not avoiding you :D I just had different stuff to do and forgot about it
[18:34:49] h0p3: I understand how that goes. You've been quite busy in school, I take it. 
[18:36:46] sinan: Did you already log my IP and useragent?
[18:36:46] sinan: That's a very dope website! I have to say I don't feel like that very often
[18:36:46] sinan: So astonished by a webdesign!
[18:37:18] h0p3: Nope. I don't log anything. It's designed to be used offline. 
[18:37:37] h0p3: That's very high praise, thank you.
[18:37:57] sinan: Thank you for sharing! Taking a quick glance it's just awesome, design wise and context wise
[18:37:59] h0p3: I [[hope]] it may be useful for us getting to know each [[other]], in case that is something you'd be interested in doing.
[18:38:08] sinan: Of course, I would love to!
[18:38:21] sinan: That's why I am here :)
[18:38:30] h0p3: You've given my [[daughter|j3d1h]] excellent advice over the years. I appreciate that. I am in your debt. 
[18:39:55] sinan: Oh, I am proud that you think so! I hoped to give her good advice, although I never know it's been received so well! 
[18:40:05] sinan: And no, by no means are you in my debt!
[18:41:08] h0p3: Well, if there is anything I can do for you, please don't hesitate to ask. I may not be useful enough, but I'll do what I can.
[18:41:26] sinan: Maybe the opposite, your daugther is very talented and I am glad I could get to know her, I am glad I get to know you!
[18:41:56] sinan: Thank you so much, that honors me quite a lot!
[18:42:28] h0p3: And, of course, I am always a special kind of retard to speak with. =D. I assure you, her talent is from her [[mother|k0sh3k]]. 
[18:43:06] h0p3: I speak from this channel asynchronously. You may always leave a message, and I always respond (though I am sometimes slow).
[18:43:19] sinan: Hahahaha, I appreciate the humor! But as much as I gathered you are quite the opposite of a retard.
[18:43:52] sinan: Thank you for viewing text channels like that, that's the power and benefit from text chatting! I see it exactly the same.
[18:43:58] h0p3: Hell yeah.
[18:44:47] sinan: May I ask how definitifely I can encipher your use of [[]]?
[18:44:51] h0p3: I [[recent]]ly left [[Discord]] again. My daughter explained that you've recently cleared out your half of the conversation. What was the trigger, if you don't mind me asking?
[18:44:55] sinan: I have guesses but no definitive answer
[18:45:25] h0p3: This is the internal wiki [[link]] syntax for the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱.
[18:45:52] h0p3: They can be searched. These are all pages into the file. 
[18:46:11] h0p3: [[j3d1h]] takes you to https://philosopher.life/#j3d1h
[18:46:18] h0p3: (though, some are [[alias]]ed)
[18:46:21] sinan: Oh my, that's very awesome
[18:46:58] sinan: I am very hyped, I love this!
[18:47:58] h0p3: I [[love]] it too. It's central to my vocation. 
[18:48:43] h0p3: The whole family has them; so, it's kinda like a decentralized social media platform we can distribute however we wish. 
[18:48:57] sinan: That is awesome!
[18:49:14] sinan: I have no words for that, I've never seen this, but it is like a dream come true
[18:51:05] sinan: I will definitely read through your state of mind and inner thinking.
[18:51:16] h0p3: Gibberish of a madman. Dismiss at-will, sir. 
[18:51:33] sinan: You just have to see, it is very late here and tomorrow I have to study for another exam...
[18:51:46] sinan: I will not dismiss by any means!
[18:52:10] h0p3: I hope you will sleep well and study hard. 
[18:52:13] h0p3: What's the test on?
[18:52:51] sinan: I already like your way of being, despite the fact that only about 15 minutes passed
[18:53:08] sinan: The test is on physiology.
[18:53:21] h0p3: I [[like]] your style too! =)
[18:53:43] h0p3: I assume you've been doing a lot of spaced repetition for that. 
[18:53:59] sinan: Thank you!
[18:54:20] sinan: I am looking very forward to reading your work. Thank you very much for sharing.
[18:54:26] sinan: And you can assure me that nothing is logged?
[18:54:34] sinan: Or being logged?
[18:54:41] h0p3: Only our messages are logged.
[18:54:54] sinan: Okay, that is no problem for me!
[18:55:08] h0p3: People will be able to reach you. [[Contact]] and [[Readme]] are worth your time.
[18:55:45] h0p3: Remember that this application can proxy through Tor. 
[18:56:01] h0p3: Say only what you are comfortable revealing. 
[18:56:54] sinan: I will and I am concious about that. Thank you!
[18:57:22] h0p3: I see that. Yes, sir. `/salute`. I wish you good [[luck]] on your exam. 
[18:57:35] sinan: Tell me, for how long have you been working on the Principles of Programming Myself and all it's application?
[18:58:00] h0p3: The ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 is only 5ish years old. 
[18:58:11] h0p3: Some of those concepts, however, have decades of work behind them.
[18:58:31] sinan: And your state of mind? I am interested on how much you developed during working on that.
[18:59:05] sinan: I mean, not only during thinking about that but during writing all of that out.
[18:59:43] h0p3: The ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 has served many purposes. One of them has been to clarify what it is that I'm pursuing and why. It's been a crucial tool for me.
[19:00:31] sinan: Working on it, code will only "compile" in a somewhat determininstic manner when written down, when giving yourself access and a deeper level of self reflection than just keeping it in mind
[19:01:14] h0p3: The backlinking in the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 will show a history of the evolution of my use of these {[[axioms]]}. 
[19:01:23] h0p3: It is a living document.
[19:01:42] h0p3: And, I cannot say it is consistent enough.
[19:02:22] sinan: I mean do not get me wrong, by that I mean a whole other dimension of recursive self construction, writing down, defining rules on paper really is different in contrast to only thinking about that. What I ask myself is how much has that working, that writing down changed your inital idea of the world?
[19:02:49] sinan: Of course disregarding all other events that happened in parallel, which is almost impossible but I might as well just ask.
[19:03:14] h0p3: Quite a bit, in my opinion. It's self-documented, in a sense. 
[19:05:22] sinan: I will read it!
[19:05:45] sinan: But right off the beginning, how strict are you really about your own axoms?
[19:06:05] h0p3: I do my best.
[19:06:16] sinan: It's always the thin, blurry line of when to manifest and when to change that keeps people where they currently are.
[19:07:04] sinan: Just glancing over, I see Gödel Escher Bach references and I absolutely love it.
[19:07:41] h0p3: It's definitely an odd place. I put my skin in the non-mere [[game]]. 
[19:12:07] h0p3: [[Aispondence]] might be an interesting place for you.
[19:12:51] h0p3: And, for studying: [[Music: Library]] is at least not awful, imho.
[19:13:28] h0p3: I have to AFK now. [[Family Gathering]]. [[j3d1h]] and [[1uxb0x]] made dinner for us. I will TTYL, my friend. Again, it's my honor and my pleasure.
[19:14:59] sinan: Thank you for the conversation! I will take a listen to the Music Library. Have a nice diner, the honor and pleasure is with me!
[19:15:59] sinan: And of course, I am looking forward to chat with you the next time!
[19:43:40] sinan: To get back to the asynchronous nature of our texting, I will text you something and you shall not feel pressure to reply to me regarding time.
[19:50:23] sinan: "I write this overaliased directory likely as some kind of self-contradictory dialectic which I can never fully understand."
"I suppose this is a naive Bayesian approach to existential gambling. I have to take the risk of being wrong here; it's the only way I can have a chance at being right."
"my computational models of myself and the world."
[19:51:14] sinan: "I'm engaged in transcendental reasoning and empirical existential investigations in this practice. I must find the way between faithful doubt and doubtful faith."
[20:04:41] sinan: When refering to or even giving the slightest judgements to those quotes, I will inevitably hurt and trim the densely packed meaning and implications of those ideas being spoken out. 
What I will say is that I recognize you and I like how you are.
I recognize that you not only strive to be your version of an Übermensch, but also every single time try to reach for the interatomic entity that fills the void between what we with our primitive and mere universally meaningless models classify in our concious reflection of the universe as subatomic particles.


[20:11:08] sinan: I really like to see your work, the inner workings of a human that represents itself in form of living literature. Almost a very good mix of a notepad and a diary, just that it represents something even higher than a work of philosophy or science. It is not only the definition of those rules, axioms and computational models of yourself like seen in many philosophy works and literature of those kinds, no, it is way more than that. It is a concise definition of not only what you stand for and try (axioms), but philosopher.life resembles a small picture of yourself. One can not only guess what lies behind all of this, one can actually read.
[20:12:44] sinan: This is the work of inner thoughts, not the compiled outcome of those
[20:13:30] sinan: And that is what I admire. Thank you for being such a stron person, that you share yourself in the form of an open book.
[20:27:47] sinan: It is almost like a picture of yours, not quite high resolution at all, but not lackluster and lossy.
This picture will tell a lot about you on a first glance, but it will also leave that mystery dust and glow of interpretation and receptional limitation, not only the deep limitation of language, but especially the deep limitations of our only possible way of perception (our processing of neural inductions, on a metaphysical level). Working on that is not a matter of filling the gaps, it is the art of progressively refining the already existing picture. And that is what makes this such empirically speaking valuable. And that is why you included yourself in that work. You gave the full picture with that. Not only the almost definitive awnser to what you describe yourself as to others, but also what you describe yourself to yourself, which just gives the foundation of a full picture.
The only gaps present in your work is the pure space between points of resolution, so one could say your whole work is flawed and parasited by almost infinitely, uncountable nanoscopic holes
[20:31:59] sinan: But that's the beauty of it. Filling those holes will not be an act of bridging meters of missing information, but it will be an act of refining, rerendering these small gaps, which results in a whole other challenge on it's own because of the exponentially increasing nature of detail, making it exponentially harder to refine and reflect those details. Which makes this approach so much more interesting.
