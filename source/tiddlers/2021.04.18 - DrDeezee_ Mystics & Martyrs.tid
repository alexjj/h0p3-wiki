title: 2021.04.18 - DrDeezee: Mystics & Martyrs

//Halt, please. I ''beg'' you. I know what it is like not to trust myself, and [[I too|Realpolitik Speculation]] know what it's like to feel [[gaslit|Memetic Warfare]] by the world. You are right to question me, [[nomad]]. I am not convinced I am the right person for you to speak with, but I [[hope]] I am. It is rare for me to directly caution anyone in my ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 like `/this`. My god, Sir Senpai DrDeezee:<<ref "a">> you have your [[naked]] skin all the way in fucking [[the game|Public Self-Modeling]]. I know that vulnerability well, and I [[aim]] to protect that. I have been reading your words like few ever have. I hate to say it, but mine are often quite painful and costly to think about too. `/nod`. I see a lot of myself in you, perhaps as though I were living a different branch of my possible lives. I don't wish to cause you one iota of further pain, and I don't know enough to know how to guarantee that.<<ref "yc">> I see where you are hunting in the desert, and it is my strict duty to be useful to you here. Very few command my [[silence]], mystic, but I think I owe it to you. Tell me to delete our words here, and you will have it. You must help me pick out what is [[salient]], including choosing the pacing of our relationship.//

I suppose it's quieter now and a more suitable environment for weightier communications. Please forgive how slow I am in communicating,<<ref "i">> especially as I digest in this open drafting to you. If you respond at all (most do not), feel free to do so however you see fit while it's being written and after. If the last year is any indication, I often take a while to respond. It feels rare for me to write [[letters]] these days, and that's in part because I'm just not good at it. I'm trying to get back into [[Finding The Others]] as I used to do, but I'm not sure I ever will again. You know [[hao|Hao 2 Search Dis Wiki]] [[it do|AIR]]. I take it neither of us are ever satisfied by our writing. I ask you to forgive my inability to understand another's poetry well enough; I do my best.<<ref "mb">> 

It's not just an honor to speak with you; it's a pleasure too. You're the real deal, Dr. Deezee.<<ref "dr">> You make it easy to respect you. I don't get to say that often. I [[like]] that. I admire your intentional work; it resonates with me. One of your {[[About]]} pieces is haunting. Lawd, do I know that feel. I think we're brothers from another mother.<<ref "sl">> I'm reminded of [[Sir Samuel Maloney]]. You also remind me of my [[Root User]], Sir [[DeathOfRobinhood]], an intelligent mystic doing his best for what matters most in the chaos (far more articulate and nicer than I am, very down to earth too). It's so hard to find [[intimacy]]. Perhaps, for people like you and me, people who have been baptized by {{Text Art: 𝕱𝕴𝕽𝕰🔥}}, who still have the will to [[Question Everything]], it's hard to get back to a state where we trust in the earnestness and empathy of [[the other]]. 

You clearly have your own doubts about my genuineness. Fair point, especially in this day and age. What words must I say to have earned the right to your trust (even if you never choose to give it, and especially when you never knew you gave it)? And, yes, I know how expensive it is to keep it real, to be accountable when others won't, to justify and prove our point when it is hated, and to ask questions we don't already know the answers to in low-trust environments. I [[hope]] you've been lookin' around. I think you'll find the answer for yourself. I pour everything I can into this ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱; it's the central piece of my vocation. Yes, I am a [[monster]], and these are grotesque words.<<ref "mo">> I [[fight]] with everyone. There are no exceptions, DrDeezee. That's probably not what you need, if you ask me. I think you're as [[lonely, broken, and intelligent as I am|2018.12.13 - kickscondor: Revelation]]. If they cared to look, I guarantee there are people on this ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 who aren't going to [[like]] you, and I doubt they'd say anything (for a number of reasons), but if they do: I'm going to tell them to fuck off.<<ref "fo">> You're a guest in my house, doctor. 

From what I can see, you are a good philosopher.<<ref "if">> I don't give a fuck that you don't have the credentials; you've got the proof in practice. Even though we may never wrestle, it's an honor to meet you, wrestler. I think you are cursed and [[lucky]] in different ways. Most who are trained for it don't have what you've got. I've met my fair share of mere academics (though also my fair share of saints too), and I often have to judge the difference between those who live their lives in pursuit of wisdom (and wisdom's [[End]]) and those who rhetorically move symbols on the plane without committing themselves to what is signified beyond their crypto-solipsism and gnostic subjectivist sophistry (those hypocritical non-committal egoists). I think you tend to you put your money where your mouth is. You've traveled far for what you seek, and you've paid some high prices for that.

I'm [[grateful]] that you openly face my [[Gentle Clearnet Doxxing]]. You have integrity. And, you do so knowing that I am not nice to pigs or heroes. You are an exception to me. You are a man of [[faith]]. It's not just a mark on you, you have the core of it in you. I'm convinced you are doing your best with what you have, despite what may be considerable disagreements between us. You are an honest man. You've been putting who you are on-the-wire for a long time, and you didn't half ass it at all. You throw down. I respect how you put your skin in the game with me and everyone.<<ref "r">> 

I [[aim]] to be a straight-shooter. You're quite intelligent, you parse my words carefully, and it's not going to take you long to see what I think and feel. Those who defend capitalism have a serious uphill battle in building a relationship with me. I'll talk about bread and paper, if you wish. Perhaps we should table that discussion, unless you really want to have it. Though, I think we would also agree that not many people actually take up their [[pleft]]ism without devolving into moral relativism, egoism, anti-realism, and the kinds of skepticism that are conveniently wielded to ignore our responsibilities to [[others]]. I wrestle with everyone, and I [[aim]] for some positively chilling aspects of my voice. It's my job to be a torch for both what is [[good]] in [[Humanity]] and its objective [[FTSO]]-which-ness that extends beyond intersubjectivity with my dialectical ball of lightning. I'm not fun to be around if you don't have high matching mutual expectations (you may be an exception), and few people like me in the end, DrDeezee. It's okay if you don't.

<<<
I found our interaction intriguing but all your comments were nuked by moderators (and I got banned for no reason so that's fun too) and I couldn't remember your username to contact you via reddit.
<<<

Thank you for telling me. I'm disappointed in the mods. Very few people care about freespeech like I do. You've had strong opinions about the matter too. I ended up transcluding [[2021.04.17 - Le Reddit Log: Hao 2 Sneer]] into [[The Good]] to improve the odds that people would hear all sides of the conversation, including what got taken to DMs (some people got eaten alive for it). 

Our interaction was intriguing to me too. Let us say that I likely encounter the voices of a thousand people a day (a hedged-conservative estimate of my hyperreading), most of them unique, never seen 'em before. Your words stood out, and not just because you were speaking of or to me about my {[[Axiom]]}. I don't know your experience with such things, but novelty is quite a drug. 

<<<
Your site is also a bit dense and hard for me to navigate and figure out how to contact you.
<<<

Ah, I'm sorry. My autism is egregious. You are not the first to say it, and you won't be the last. It's part of my retardation. Even as I make progress in that problem, I find there are tough balances to strike. Please let me know if I can [[help]] you. 

With practice, I think this site becomes eminently usable, but I appreciate that I'm extremely biased as its primary pilot. I hate to say it, but I often leave people more confused and uncertain than before I spoke; I fail to communicate correctly so often. Most people end up quitting on building a relationship with me, and I don't want you to feel bad about that. I've read enough of your words to trust you here. All of my close friends receive what seems like an obvious to gift that almost shouldn't have to be said, it would seem, from me. You get it out of the gate, Sir [[DrDeezee]]: [[The Ol' Yeller Clause]]. `/hands-you-the-card`

I am on the hunt for an answer(s) in a maze, and I think you know that feel. Most think I'm crazy for it, and I want you to feel comfortable distancing yourself from me. I'm serious: most people need it. I put myself out here, but that doesn't mean you are going to be in a position to do it with me. You also don't want to wrestle,<<ref "wr">> and I wrestle with everyone. You can still use my tool without wrestling directly, of course.

<<<
Regardless... you mentioned a specific type of wiki tool to build a site and that seemed interesting to me as well, but since your posts were deleted, I'm at a loss as to figuring out more about that tool...You seem very technically proficient, when it comes to your wiki and archival and things of that nature. I possess some rudimentary skills but I would love the opportunity to learn more about building such a wiki. It may be a better backend for what I vaguely hope to accomplish, than WordPress is.
<<<

[[Tiddlywiki|https://tiddlywiki.com]] is amazing. Creativity needs a box, and this is the fittingly flexible hypercube for a skiddie retard like me. I've tried a lot of tools, but this one has stuck like very few do. I'm happy to talk shop about [[computing]]. I do my best with my computers, but I'm not gifted at it. So, while I have some earned opinions in some places with this tool, I'm no master of this contraption. If you do get into it, you might search this wiki for information, and you definitely should check out the Tiddlywiki Google Group forums (yes, I know it's ironic). Feel free to ask questions. 

I think Tiddlywiki has a painful learning curve (and the ecosystem is a clusterfuck, and I still haven't upgraded, and...you get the picture) that is still better than the alternatives. This shit works. Dive in. Use it to write. You obviously do that well. It's a great place to store one's old blogs or even integrate a universe of writing (yours and [[others]]'). Imho, the common failure I see among most beginners is that they don't actually use TW, they only taste it without acquiring sufficient experience to have earned the right to say they actually tried it. If there's a different manner in which you want to use it, you can work your way there with sufficiently low friction. It's a place you can rice for ricing's sake, but I think it makes way more sense to just get your work done in it. 

<<<
Hoping there was some authenticity to our reaction regardless of being banned...
<<<

I can appreciate that. You go ahead and think about [[FTO]] (and the proofs run much deeper, into [[Wiki Review]]s too). Wander it. I'm doing the best I can, including writing you a [[Letter]]. I see you've not used your Reddit account since our last interaction. My guess is that you have seen what I'm doing here. Take your time. Feel free to [[HMU|Contact]] on IM too (qTox and Session are dope). I keep lots of lines open as part of my attempt to implement The Robustness Principle. Some people think it quite odd that I speak so directly from my wiki and that I require my interlocutors to engage me through it if they are going to engage me at all at some level (that's how people authenticate with me - many figure out my passwords, but few will grind with me). 

I'm sorry that you got banned for speaking with me. That is immoral of them. Our conversation didn't pollute the commons. Far from it. It was the only conversation that held water and weight in there. 

<<<
For my own spiritual reasons, I'm no longer paranoid/overly concerned about my physical identity being "outed," hence why I don't take a ton of action to anonymize myself.

Perhaps I will change that when other people in my life might be at risk by my public exposure but as of right now, I'm flying solo.
<<<

I know these problems well. I feel the weight of them in my work constantly. I belong with the sinners who are widely hated rather than widely [[like]]d. I try to prepare myself to speak with all kinds, especially those who go unheard. It's an expensive task. I don't fly solo, but I think we are so privileged, we don't have a huge right to privacy from [[others]] (though I will argue we do against those more [[power]]ful than us in most cases).<<ref "pr">> I also strongly favor [[anonymous]] giving. 

You do whatcha gotta do, homie. So far, I've always removed information when asked. You let me know what you need. 

<<<
You may have to teach me a little bit how to converse with you via the wiki; it's not immediately apparent to me how I might leave comments / contribute / etc.
<<<

I wrote in [[@: DrDeezee]] on this one, but I'll continue here. You'll have to speak with the tools you have to speak with. I still don't have enough experience in [[hyperconversation]]s to know how to do it best. The ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 is my primary device; our relationship won't develop thoroughly long-term without your consistent use of it. I'd like to be a guest in the house of your mind as well (TW preferred, and I can give you technical reasons for why if you want them), but I realize that's a huge ask.

<<<
I have so much skin in the game these days that I'm not really perturbed when I'm de-platformed or what have you.
<<<

I would like to understand more. I am perturbed by it, but I've been able to reduce it somewhat to an inconvenience. I agree that you have your skin in the game. I'd be interested to see you continue to write your story and to unify it. I rarely know if and when someone is going to respond, and it's okay if you don't or you take years. Even if this is the last time we get to speak, I'm glad we met. You give me [[hope]].

[[Love]], Your Madman,

[[h0p3]]
