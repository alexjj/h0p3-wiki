* 4/5
** Expensive pickles. Very fancy. This is a splurge.<<ref "t">> It's not something I want every day, but I would greatly enjoy it every week.
* Not many people realize it, but this isn't a pickle product per se.<<ref "p">> It's a beverage that happens to have a lot of cucumber garnish.<<ref "r">>
* I've met my fair share of sportsball players who swear by this shit. They say it helps with their cramps and dehydration. Now, I don't know about all that, but I can say it is outstanding.
* Keep a sippin' jar next to your reading machine, like moonshine. 
** It's energizing, cleanses the palate, and it cuts through phlegm with a bright tongue spanking.<<ref "d">>

<<footnotes "a" "And, I suppose for those who didn't wash their hands before grabbing a pickle out of the jar: your pee is also tasty when diluted in this beverage.">>

<<footnotes "t" "Tastes much better than the splooge that comes from them holes.">>

<<footnotes "p" "Though the pickles are great. The crunch is surprising. These don't last even a day in [[The Alien Asylum]].">>

<<footnotes "r" "pickle vodka for a bloody mary works">>

<<footnotes "d" "I like to drink a lot, and not just because I'm an alcoholic or a mammal. I'm more like a utility monster when it comes to beverages, my ninja.">>
