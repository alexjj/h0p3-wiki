Democracy has to be built upon guaranteeing that each voice has the ability to amplify or suppress information for themselves and those who trust them (correct or otherwise) in a public commons upheld beyond each individual's desires. That is not an argument in favor of censorship though.

Yes, I'm WEIRD (suck it). I'm obsessed with obeying abstract, seemingly impersonal rules, as almost a practical worship of propositions (or rather to that which they correspond). Nothing rugged or ethnocentric about it: I see myself as an individual seeking universal principles while chafing against conforming to mere conventions of others that aren't in pursuit of what is objective, essential, and universal, [[Other]]ness [[Itself]] (we all stand in relation to it).

Survive in the world by becoming a node in a network bound by elaborate rules: know and perform your role in relation to everyone.

If you want it to be coherent, go all in on your realism. Being selective is sus. Realism of the self and The World stand and fall together. It's biconditional in all possible worlds. Realism about particulars mutually entails realism about universals. This extends to the physical world and the mental world of ideas, language and meaning, and objects and inherence.

Science talks about parts of this world. Math talks about parts of all possible worlds. Philosophy talks about the relationships between what is [[salient]] in all possible worlds and ours.
