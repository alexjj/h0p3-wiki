* [[1uxb0x]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I didn't have as good of a wiki as I would have liked, but it will do. I'm longating my prompeted introspection and antipleonasm analysis so they have 4 instead of 3 lines for me. I know my "code" is confusing, I need to fix it more and make it better. I forgot to have a ls command for my code, so that was funny. Its bad I didn't finish my lightning thief stuff.
** j3d1h
*** You seemed much happier with your work this week. I'm glad you're actually valuing what you put out! Your RRP Code Stuff is a little bit confusing, but I like that you're trying it. It's good to think about what you need in a basic system. You should know that most roleplayers won't want to use this system - most on that medium aren't very tech savvy, and you're trying to teach a whole new language. I liked the notes for your presentations, but you need to do more research.
** k0sh3k
*** I feel like you were rushing through your work this week - that you got started late and never quite caught up. I was glad to see your Carpe Diems had more in them, though! I like that you're tracking what you do each day better, although I think there's still room to improve. I don't think you worked as hard on work for me this week - particularly the absent Walking with Monsters report and the unfinished final paper for The Lightning Thief. I hope that will pick up next week. I know a big part of it was your being sleepy; I hope you get better sleep this week!
** h0p3
*** [[1uxb0x]] has had some really tough moments this week. He's been constructive. I'm grateful that he will speak through tears with me. He's had fun too. He went shopping with us, and he's even gotten some room cleaning done this week. His [[Hot]] work his hawt, and I am grateful to hear him prepare and speak of the philosophers.

** 1uxb0x
*** You hurt your foot, that's bad, I can't really relate to it a lot, I haven't really gotten a sprain before. Your writing on ther lighting thief for this week was better. Thank you for doing what I'd call a majority of the kitchen today for me. I'm happy you got a lot of clothes, you'll need 'em. I think your work in RPing is too broad, but that's just me.
** j3d1h
*** I'm very happy with most of my wiki. I'm especially pleased with the RP system I've set up - it should nicely balance the problems I have while roleplaying, and still make the game fun. Smiley has been frustrated with me for timing issues and not liking his game, but I put up with the same problems on his end, so I'm just going to stop apologizing for it. I didn't draw nearly as much as planned, but what I did do was fun. Overall, I think it's been a good week.
** k0sh3k
*** I'm surprised and sad that you didn't have a "Walking with Monsters" report, either. Your notes on it were pretty excellent, though! I like the fun names and details. I really liked your writing on The Lightning Thief this week, even though it was short! You did a good job summarizing the story and answering the question. You're planning a TW makeover, and it sounds cool! I can't wait to see it. 
** h0p3
*** [[j3d1h]] hurt her foot. It hurts. She's had difficult discussions and negotiations about scheduling with the people she cares about. She's had some strong emotions and cognitions this week, a lot to feel and think. With her brother, she continues to improve in her ability to make dinner (I am spoiled). It was good to see her shop for clothing; she hasn't been able to have much practice in it. Her work in RPing, CS, her writing across the board, and her presentations of the philosophers have been impressive.

** 1uxb0x
*** Your birthday was amazing. My favorite part of your birthday was most likely the cheescake. I don't understand why they have so many meetings. I can understand that they'd need some more of them but this much? It's odd that a year ago you applied for yale, an entire year.
** j3d1h
*** You are now a little bit older than you were before, congratulations. Thank you for taking us out to Pok√©moto, it was absolutely delicious. I liked your logs a lot this week. They sound more like you, for some reason? Sorry about the wiki problems, but you're doing an awesome job solving them on your own!
** k0sh3k
*** I really enjoyed my birthday! I'm glad everyone got to eat far too much cheesecake. I am glad the reopening plan is off to first review; I'm also glad they asked me to join the phase 3 taskforce. I'll be gladdest when things return to something like normal and I can figure out what my job actually entails. New clothes are awesome. 
** h0p3
*** [[k0sh3k]] has been having trouble sleeping, her head has hurt, and her period + the weather have not been kind to her. She's been kicking ass for libraries, including long-term technical FOSS project planning. Her work with our offspring has required a great deal of energy from her, and she continues to spend the inordinate amount of energy required to stomach spending time with me. Her catechetical work is profound; I am increasingly excited to see the radical body of work she is constructing and gives away freely. I am always amazed by the disingenuous manner in which people claim she is wise but do not listen to and read her words.

* [[h0p3]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I think our h0p3ful reviews this week have been worse than normal. I also think that my work for you this week was also worse than normal. It's sad we won't get to go on that trip to the outdoors this week. It's annoying that the repairman hasn't come back in two weeks, two, weeks, thats almost a month! I'm sorry that I've been failing philisophical analysis this week.
** j3d1h
*** You've always been the cautionary tale. You talked to some interesting people again this week. Do you think you've made more online acquaintances because of CV-19's restrictions, or just about the same? I still find it incredibly weird that you call me a woman. I'm still pretty much a kid, I just act more mature than some of the adults I know? Also, Philosophical Analysis has been quite fun this week, for me at least.
** k0sh3k
*** If your wiki gives me brain-melting cancer, I'm going to be very unhappy with you. "My bet is that she just wants to veg" - you know me so well! I think you enjoyed my day as much as I did. :) I like watching even bad movies with you, as long as I can sneak onto my computer or Nook while we watch. We had some good walks this week, too; I like how you want to think about the future with me. I am glad you got new underwear; now you just have to wear it. I liked spending the whole day with you yesterday; it was a good day.
** h0p3
*** [[h0p3]] continues to speak with many people; it is exceptionally expensive in some cases. He's got a fuckton he wants+needs to do and not enough time to do it (cool story bro). Walk, jock, coffee, bliss, and interwebs have been wonderful. He was successful in planning the shopping trip, and he's looking forward to [[urban-survival.tdl]]. He's holding his breath as the machinations of July are meant to be a dry run for the Fall semester. He's annoyed with his landlord (well, all of them, actually), but he's grateful to have a home he enjoys living in.
