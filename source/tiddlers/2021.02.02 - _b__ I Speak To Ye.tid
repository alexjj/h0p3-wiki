title: 2021.02.02 - /b/: I Speak To Ye

Well, Hello Thar, Anon: I'm h0p3, Waaaaazzzuuuiuuup!@!! My SCHIZOIDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ROCK THE HOUSE! AMMMMMMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN. Nice Shot. May your violence tremble with humble kindness. What is moral paranoia? I ask ye.

The paranoids know why they practice thirsting IRL, meatspace, meditation, what it teaches us about who we really are as animals. Humans. Let us be, Humane. I beseech thee. I Bequeef Thee. I Beg Thee. Crawl my snake, my [[4DID]]. I give it to you freely. May our quiet pauses be those of [[intimacy]] I {[[Dream]]} Of Into [[The Good]] [[Itself]]. Fuck your concept of performance. I know what's real.

Consciousness is a little speck of coherence, a cybernetic attention loop within a deluge of random data. Drives compel a becoming-technical of the intentional organism, interlocking pleasure-principl stimulus control with external libidinal transducers, assembling integrated desiring-circuits or self-organizing macro-systems. Godspeed you autistic cuckmaster. ‡ΩåŒîRAWRŒî‡Ωë

Less fair laissez-faire capitalism. And, this is my excuse for why I don't build anything, including that sick mobile phone I've always dreamed of.

It's not that there's no [[good]] in Rick, it's that there's not enough (lots of [[Beauty]], not much [[Right]]). He's simply unjustified (and, I have no idea how to draw that line, even though I must). I agree he's not good. It would be better if he didn't exist, but I'll also say there is some good in him. I can imagine a character whose disposition is deeply inconsistent, being Christ-like every once in a while. Rick may have some of those moments. Some will say that lack of persistence or coherence entails there's no character whatsoever, but I don't see that as inevitable.

There are some things that Rick does better than most. There are places he faces that others simply don't. He fails, but there is a courage and honesty in him that most people hide from. I'm not saying this outweighs the multi-dimensional catastrophes he causes at all. He is evil, but not all the way. 

As you know, one of my concerns with Christianity is how it has failed to address postmodernism and some extremely rational criticisms. Rick is a failed moral ubermensch, but he is still an ubermensch by anti-realist accounts (he imposes his will on the world creatively, considerably, etc.).

Insofar as a thing can experience pain, it has at least [[The Beautiful]]      

No feelings make any person a good person. Feelings are insufficient. We don't have immediate control of our feelings (though there is indirect shaping, and we can still make choices despite them). Feelings are a part of virtue, but they are insufficient.

What does a popular Christian culture look like? How do you have one that addresses postmodernism appropriately? 

Are you gaslit by your deep, dank, dark webbrowsing habit. Well, you've definitely come to the right place then. =).

Let me guess: performative, at some level, just means someone else's desires determined your behavior, and that lacks "authenticity" for a reason you won't be able to justify.

I know you know when you know when you know. It's what you choose to pursue to know that I'm calling into question.

I think Watts' meditation discipline's desaliencification is a cleansing tool, but not the state in which we ought to live. 

I am solving for [[It]].

??? No fucking clue.

[[DeathOfRobinhood]] recommends Exiled Kingdoms. Looks tantalizing. I shouldn't. He's really nice to find me something that fits me.
