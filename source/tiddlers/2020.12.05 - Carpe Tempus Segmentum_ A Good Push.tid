title: 2020.12.05 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: A Good Push

Nobody can hear anything in this house. We're going to have to actually get off our asses and find each other face-to-face instead of yelling out for each other like civil people.

* Woke at 2:30
** Great sleep. It was too short. I wish I could just stick another 4 hours in there. But, that's not what my brain is going to let me do.
*** I am so used to fighting against the stream. I feel like 2021 might offer increased opportunities to just go with the flow. 
* //Tether Me Softly//
** I fucking hate slurping through this 4G straw, but I'm [[grateful]] to have access. 
*** I continue to beg my brother [[AIR]] to take a laptop too (and even that is unacceptably too little in my eyes, but I'm privileged and set in my ways to have used desktops for three decades). 
** Dat plebbit juice.
** I've noticed everyone has been using their phones. Usually, it's just my daughter. 
* Back to sleep by 6
** Was hoping to finish off the truck before noon. It's another $40 to get some sleep.
* Was woken at 10:15 in a blur. Fuck me.
** When my wife says "we a have problem," I am called upon to fix it immediately. Could not think straight.
** It was snowing. Gorgeous, but this posed some problems. All of our routes have very shitty roads for snow (some of the climbs are steep enough that our ghetto hybrid can barely climb it on a good day), the cats are stuck at the old residence, and I screwed up not turning the heat back on (didn't feel like heating the outside while all exits were open for the move). 
** We left in a hurry. Wasn't sure offspring were even coming with. Started the day out stressed. 
* Cats were harnessed, leashed, and led to the car with their snacks. 
* It sleeted while my offspring loaded up the truck.
** Their pace today was not great. 
*** We've discussed it many times over the years (more than they will remember), and a couple times in the past few days: you want to avoid this kind of labor? Start kicking ass in your school work. It's your best shot.
**** My son has enjoyed the physical labor and the tangible rewards of moving. It's easy to see progress here. Talking about trades.
** There was more left than I'd have liked. 5-10%. 
* I deep cleaned the top floor.
** It's obvious that my offspring have been lying to me a lot in 2020. Their bathroom was an epic disaster. 
** Looks good. I'll spackle and hit the walls one more time on Monday.
* Bidet uninstalled, moved almost everything into the truck, and the boys drove off.
** Unfortunately, it appears we forgot our pots, pans, and baking sheets. Doesn't matter what I say sometimes. `/sigh`. (Didn't find this out until later though)
* My son tried helping direct me while backing the truck (tight and I'm still taking up a lane on what is a relatively busy street).
** I can see his autism here. He will be much better than I am at this. 
* Unloaded the truck for the last time. 
** Offspring are lethargic. Better than nothing though. I'm glad they are here working.
** All of frozen and refrigerated goods are now where they belong. 
*** We've decide to mix the dry ark into our pantry now. The critical period has passed.
** Assisted my wife with Xfinity. Coax looks old, and I don't like how it's run through the heating grate. 
** I made the last push because we had run out of time.
* Son and I took the truck back. Different route, gassed up (my son read the screwed up gas-chart correctly...forgot to have him guess a reason why they would have different numbers of gallons per quarter interval of the tank), navigated the ugly shit, dropped it off just in time. 
** The move is going to cost us ~$750. Best we could do.
* We went back to the old residence with the SUV. 
** Ran another load of laundry.
** Packed our electronics, ganja, screens, and most of the remaining tools. 
** My son is getting better at navigating and directing me. 
* Unloaded. Pizza.
* //Skintime//
** We are both exhausted. I can't even masturbate: that's how tired I am.<<ref "t">> 
** Meow curled up next to me on the bed for a long time. She did her berserk frenzy scent trading thing and licked my armpit for half an hour.
*** She is far more comfortable in this move than the other two she's experienced. It felt like a normal transition for a cat. 
**** Ranga was exploring within minutes. He seems to know his way around already, despite the mountains of insanity around us.
* Fell asleep by 10?

I am in charge of the move and setting up the house (cool), but I need to be in multiple places at once. I'm not able to disseminate what ought to occur fast enough. Only I can make too many of the decisions, so I bounced around and filled the spots where I could. 

I'm sad to see that our interwebs won't be up until Tuesday, at best.

My son has called it another great day. That dude is interesting. It was emotionally tense for him: I barked orders the entire day, and he argued a lot with his sister. He got some good work done though. It was obvious to him that we couldn't have done it without him (he's now the second strongest person in the house), and I've told him that several times in the past few days.<<ref "j">>

We've still got some major pushes left. Monday we'll bang the rest out, make sure she prorates rent, walk through for deposit (will need to remind our landlord that the floor is hers to fix, as this was pushed off by her own handy man until after we left). I need to get //The Asylum// back to normal as fast as I can. [[k0sh3k]] is in a deep push until the 18th with no help beyond her assistant (who I am grateful pushes at least 80%).<<ref "i">>

<<footnotes "t" "I worked a factory job back when we first got married, at a Ford plant (All Hail), and I came home after a graveyard shift, flopped onto the bed, and my wife started blowing me (there's something crazy hawt about a pregnant woman drinking your cum, btw). I fell asleep during the blowjob, lol. I wasn't that tired today, thankfully.">>

<<footnotes "j" "I am reminded of how many times I have relied upon my brother [[JRE]] to move. He has made it possible for us to live. I missed his call today, but I couldn't take it. We were so balls-to-the-wall.">>

<<footnotes "i" "Interesting to see her assistant makes more than my wife. 15 years in the clink.">>
