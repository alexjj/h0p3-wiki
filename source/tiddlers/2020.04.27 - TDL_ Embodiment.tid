* See if we can move to [[Embodied Cognition]] instead.
* Leftovers. 
** Need to use the meat we have in fridge too...a lunch?
*** Yeah, brats should just be made. Cook 'em up.
**** I'm pretty fucking scared to even try a bit at this point. The last two times I had to lay on my belly and shit straight up. 
* [[Kevin Kovacs]] reply.
** Still pondering [[azl]]. 
* She's really tired. Prolly won't get to fuck. 
** `/wahhhmbulance`
** Walk though, would be the tits.
** Do you need to just buy up a yearly supply? You already think it's breaking down. 
*** She would not fare well without it.
* CS time
** Script for him (GO GO GO!!), Windows test the other (fuck it, she had her shot). 
* [[Rink Rog|Link Log]], prease.
* A game during [[Family Gathering]]. 
** You see, it distracts us from having to engage in real conversations (oh noes)...buuuuuut, that's okay in our case, I'd argue (overshooting the golden mean).
