title: 2020.06.01 - Prompted Introspection: You Knew It Was Coming

!! Have you ever swallowed something strange?

This is such a basic human experience that it's a universal metaphor even, and it's obvious that it should be a [[prompt]]. [[2019.02.04 - Prompted Introspection: Strange Swallowing]] barely grazes any analysis of it. The question is cleaned up just a bit, so now it's time to make the answer dirty. I should have lots of great answers. For example, I suspect that 95% of humans have shamefully eaten their own shit as a baby.<<ref "d">>

Yes, I have eaten my own yummy cummies, like any good boi. It is strange to consume mucus, including own's own. Sometimes it's hawt, and sometimes it's snot. I adore watching it in porn though. My preference is that it is fresh and warm. I simply couldn't drink it from a bowl without being paid for it. 

Iamamammal.

<<footnotes "d" "Don't let me wee wife fool ya', she definitely ate hers all the time. For all I know, she still does. I wouldn't know at this point. You see: I've never been allowed even near the bathroom while she makes, as it is simply unacceptable for a Southern Belle to be subjected to the scrutiny, or so I am told. Look, woman, I just want to talk. I know you poop; I saw you give birth twice.">>
