* Read+//GoT//
* Fireman Time! x3
* Read+//GoT//
* Prepped Thanksgiving meal
* Chips+Water
* Sleep by 8?
* Woke at 1:30
* //Skintime//
* [[JRE]] Called
** Thinking about apprenticeships for machining
** He's thinking about reading books, particularly on politics.
** I had to leave early for our gathering.
* Video Conferencing with in-laws
** 3 hours of listening. It is not a place for me to be myself (my immediate family probably has to silence themselves the most of the bunch), of course.
** My offspring participated; they were the only youth there. Poor things. At least they get to see the spectacle in action.
** Got to see people's homes. 
** [[R]] may have openly requested living with the middle daughter. 
** Offspring and I were messaging on Signal
* Fireman Time!
* Read+Write+//GoT//
* Finished cooking the meal
** My worry that she shouldn't push hard to cook was well-founded. It was unnecessary stress. It was delicious though.
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, gravy, squash, roasted veggies, and a hairy navel.
** [[MTG]]:
*** Son's MUC+2 vs Affinity. Strip Mine + Mana Leak hosed me. Flashed OStone and I scooped. GG.
*** Son's MUC+1 vs MWC. Told him I might deck him at the beginning. That's what I did. Control matchups teach great magic; they aren't meant to control each other usually.
** We had pie too. =)
* Just a single load of dishes, and the rest can wait for tomorrow. Fuck it.
* Called [[JRE]]
** I think he referred to the last link to him in [[2020.11.11 - Link Log: Psychopolitical]]. I struck out on that one. [[2020.11.24 - Link Log: Just Remember That If It Doesn't Satisfy You Immediately, Then It's A Piece Of Shit]] was more interesting. I'll keep hunting.
** He made me literally laugh my ass off (I had to sew my bear bottom back on) and then exercised his [[Root User]] privilege.
** They ate well. They need time off. A day without children and some TLC would go a long way.
** Talked about a YT channel he's going to send my son on mechanics. 
** Quinn is huge. They are worried he's eating too much. He's going to be a giant.
* Called [[AIR]] up
** Unfortunately, I was late. Didn't have much time to talk. He's hanging in there.
* Called [[gh057]]
* Started writing message to [[DeathOfRobinhood]]
* //GoT// and eventually some //Skintime//
** Think my wife needs some time for herself.
* Sleep by 11?
