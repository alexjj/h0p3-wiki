; Dead and entitled people have written a lot of pompous words in distant buildings built by slaves and wage slaves, but that doesn't make a social contract. The laws some people write for them and theirs do not attain universal applicability by virtue of the size of the mass they are written for

Anyone who says that laws written in the capitol apply to all the people in the countryside is a nazi, straight up. The state and statists are the problem and the state is a fantasy of a universal aetheric moral substance that enables universal "justified" computation. Any application of force at a distance is the action of a state.

A bunch of epistemically-entitled appropriators of the universal Reason might delude themselves into thinking they can write universal law, and they might write some very nice things, but the sick bolus at the center of these documents will always be when they attempt to arrange the lives of distant people according to a preconceived image. The construction of law based upon universal Reason is fucked because it has no theoretical concept of time or the gradual rollout of this official version of Reason to those who have never heard of it yet. So it begins and at once occludes its evangelical project under the loud trumpet of universal rights and universal suffrage, universal access to the goods of society. But these "universal" rights are only granted to those who choose to show up as a Citizen in the statist—culturally, economically, and epistemically colonized—society.

Deinstitutionalization means the eventual or ultimate deletion of the Citizen role. But we need not throw out the baby with the bathwater. We can keep all the good things about being a citizen, but just throw out the hegemonic authority with which citizenship is recognized. This means 1) Everybody becomes authorized to judge "citizenship" for themselves, whatever that means, and 2) The provision of rights and goods becomes based on human, not mechanical, judgment. The implications of #1 is that there is no longer a central authority dispensing centralized binary citizenship (is/is not a citizen universally)—and, there may be the emergence of many "citizenships" that all become important, rather than one centralized statist Citizenship dominating everything and everyone's concept of identity.

One side-effect of this is that we will gain the right to choose who protects us. Claiming to be the police for another person is a claim of ownership over them. Showing up to a situation to police it is a claim of general ownership over or prerogative from the people there.

The fact is, somebody claiming that they have prerogative to police you or to write law for you, just because they claim that they already speak for a large number of people (many of whom would vehemently disagree that they are spoken for), is total bullshit and we all know it. Not only is this logic of "I was elected and therefore I write the laws for the people who didn't elect me" circular and morally and logically bankrupt from the start, this rhetoric serves no function at all except to invalidate resistance and dissent against unwanted statist governance.

Statism is essentially ruling people who did not agree to it: in other words, ruling persons against their will, or applying force from a safe distance.

We can easily invert our horrible system to imagine a better one (instead of wasting our time blustering against these obvious truths about the obvious moral bankruptcy of statism and all institutions). What if instead of being forced to assent to horrible leaders, we proactively told each other who are favorite living leaders are? And then we proactively shared their writings or speeches, and talked about the political issues they are raising? I think very quickly, by finding our favorite leaders and then asking them who their favorite leaders are, we would find the true leaders of the free world. These are the people we should be paying attention to, ideologically following, and listening to as we write our laws. These are the true, the wise secret chiefs who are currently the true and deposed rulers of planet Earth, the ones who would take better care of the planet and its people.

The fascist despots installed by blanketing the countryside in lies are not real leaders, they are installed simulacra of leadership meant to influence people into forgetting to proactively talk about their true leaders and their true values. Even a tiny bit of real, positive-spiral politics is extremely dangerous to negative-feedback-loop-based systems such as institutions.

There is a new kind of law yet to be written, non-universal law. This would be law for persons who assented to it, and who helped write and rewrite it. Non-universal law is law not based on an asinine contradiction: the literally idiotic assumption that universal law can be written by a finite, instantiated, flawed person from a particular cultural and historical and education background and still apply to everyone somehow. Gleefully rubbing their dicks on the page, white men have been speaking for absent subaltern people since the declaration of the Universal was first spoken and used as the rhetorical basis for law.

It's a shitty, manipulative rhetoric and we all hate it! The social contract is dead. I declare it dead, I recognize that it has already died, I recognize that we have all already collectively recognized the death of the social contract.

Fuck nations. Fuck any authority who claims to speak for someone who isn't their follower, who hasn't explicitly said that their idol can speak for them. Fuck anyone who holds up a piece of paper or some words on a computer and tells you that's why you have to do what they say. Fuck anyone who goes along complicitly or eagerly with abusive systems and gaslighting propaganda campaigns—we all know from watching Fascbook's rise and fall how important willing participation is in propping up these systems! So stop it
! Stop collaborating with systems and with people who try to make decisions for other persons! Plan, at the earliest opportunity, ways to exit every system to which you have been yoked and forced to pull the plow. This is not hatred—this is love of what we could have if we spent our time and resources on the truly good things, instead!

I'll be closely thinking about your words, [[Anders]]. You are often more careful with your words, but you make some important errors in this one. I [[respect]] your compassion, humility, and radical empathy. You give a shit about people, all the way down. You aim to respect persons, especially those who you cannot benefit from. I'm [[lucky]] to have met you. So, I admire why you are so angry here. `/nod`. I appreciate your taking the time to tell us what you think. Thank you.

> Thanks. Of course it is very polemic. It's not meant to make a perfect or cogent argument. Do you see any ways the argument or rhetoric could be improved?

Yes, sir. I'm thinking about it.

What's it meant to be? What's it for? Why should it be that?

> No intentions, I was just in a moment where I could write it so I wrote it. I wrote the headline and thought it was just going to be a one-line shitpost but then that essay happened.

Well, of course, I appreciate your taking the time to write what strikes me as something far more than a [shitpost](https://philosopher.life/#%2Fb%2F). I'll also submit that it is difficult to know even our own intentions all the way down. In that case, given more context, I'm not convinced what I think is sufficiently relevant to say here. `/nod`. I endeavor to accept your gift for what it is, even if I do not know what it is or what it will become. At the very least, it is [[beautiful]] [[art]]. Thank you, again.

> Thank you :3. May I ask how you use the double brackets?

Yes. This is perhaps the second [[time you've asked me|2022.05.29 - Anders Aamodt: The Tea Merchant™]] ([e.g.](https://philosopher.life/#2022.05.29%20-%20Anders%20Aamodt%3A%20The%20Tea%20Merchant%E2%84%A2)). These brackets are the syntax for internal wiki[[link]]ing in my ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱. You might say these are the stories my family members in [[The Alien Asylum]] (and some [[others]]) [[read|Readme]] with [[me|h0p3]]. I believe the document approaches ~80 novels in length after 6 years of daily work; so it's really only for the insane (and, we are). SotS is a household phrase for us, as we even carefully consider the words of some of the [[amazing citizen|Impassionata]]s of this digital state.

I want you to know that despite our profound disagreement (and from reading your words, I know you do not know what I've said), our commitment to P2Pdom is something we [[share]]. I [[aim]] to live it. Conversation is a sacrament, and every person is my teacher. I'm [[grateful]] to be a part of this community; you've done a [[good]] job, sir.

> Ah, that's exactly what I suspected! Sorry I forgot, hard to keep track of various screennames.

Indeed, I know [[how|hao]] difficult that can be. It takes a lot of time and energy for me to remember all the names of a person, particularly as an autist. I'd be interested in having discussions with you on platforms where I cannot be censored; that's an important problem to consider in [[justice]], my friend. I [[hope]] you will continue to think about it, particularly as pertains to moral realism and [[P2P|Outopos]] considerations.
