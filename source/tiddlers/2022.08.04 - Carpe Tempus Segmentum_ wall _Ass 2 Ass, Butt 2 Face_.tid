title: 2022.08.04 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: wall "Ass 2 Ass, Butt 2 Face"

[[TTTOTW]]. Very much enjoying myself with [[EssOS]]. The bidet sprung a leak, with the metal sheath coming down off the head. Dead, and water everywhere. Lucky I was awake. We did get our money's worth though. We're gonna need to use the valve consistently (which, unfortunately, isn't so easy to reach). Massage. [[TTTOTW]]. Sleep by 3?

Woke at 8:30? Half-brained garbage sleep. I'm glad that I get so much sleep. Can afford that shit. They came much earlier than we scheduled. Caffeine. [[TTTOTW]].

Solar fellers fixed problems. They enjoyed my SSIDs, and they let me finish connecting. I've papers I need to save. And, inspectors did come today. The miscommunication is annoying, but I'm glad about the results. Passed. Waiting on our electric company for the final piece before we flip the switch.

[[TTTOTW]]. 

Offspring came down to grind, and they preferred haxorz to maths. Aight. Offspring abusing `wall "foobar"` while we are working on the VM. Tuntox got tested, and it worked for all of us (though autostart didn't seem to work nicely). raTox tunnels worked. [[Resilio Sync]] worked. Still relying up relays all over the place. Didn't get arouund to [[vpncloud.rs]] and spork.sh testing. Unfortunately, can't set up Mosh to fix the latency in any reasonable fashion (ugly fucking trix). Still thinking about how I want hidden services to work, and I'm not so convinced Tor over Tor correlation is as dangerous as some seem to worry. 

//The Walk// with mi amor. Played the clarinet. She's disjointed today, but productive. Not feeling depressed, though anxious given how hard it has been to focus. School starts in a few weeks. A deep dive into divinity and moral philosophy: they nailed it! Different words, but it is the correct analysis. Talked [[EssOS]]. Reggie had us over for veggies. Picked tomatoes while he talked. The CBD tincture is helping him. He wants more. We can do that.

[[TTTOTW]]. Purchased 30ml dropper bottles. Saw joe jenett come and go recently. Thought about saying, "hi."

Chilled with my sympaticon in the kitchen.

[[Family Gathering]]. We had burgers. //Stranger Things//, season 4. I'm paying 90% attention now. Some work on the prototype.
