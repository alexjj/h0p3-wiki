It's good to see you again. I'm thinking: "Here we go. This is much closer." Thank you for your response. I strongly appreciate your honesty (and, I'm pretty sure you know how much I hate being lied to). I'll openly take that. I know interacting with me is expensive, and I aim to take our asymmetries into account as best I can.

<<<
You're damn right I don't agree precisely with my own words.
<<<

XD. I hear ya. 

This seems to be part of our struggle: What do we mean, as precisely as we can explain, by `/that`? I wonder what you do agree to more precisely, and I tried to give you something workable to throw back at me. I appreciate that you are humble about your words.

And, I know, we were on an ironical subplebbit where the merely constructed social conventions of the mods and users (and Conde Naste's employees and shareholders, the US & China, and [global [[power]] dynamics, zeitgeists, and discourses in general]) allowed or even encouraged imprecision and trolling. I'm trying to take that into account too. I ask you to be as precise as you can afford to be with me; I am a terrible interpreter, except in analytic settings. Most end up leveraging sweeping [[rhetoric|Memetic Warfare]], [[poetry|Poetry]], or [[silence]] rather than sitting down to work it out with me.<<ref "a">> Communicating well is expensive ([[WINTCIS]]), and, again, you don't have to engage me.

We all need people who can interpret our words for us; we're social creatures by nature, and there are some philosophical problematics that we can't make progress in without [[others]]. We're both neurodiverse enough that we know what it's like not to have many people in our lives who will be profoundly patient with us, who fairly assume good intentions, who have habituated the ability to almost instinctively read between the lines, who curiously and unashamedly take the time to look up words and phrases they don't know (I often don't know how to pronounce most words either), who charitably fill in the gaps (sometimes with with a graceful missing piece to our puzzle), who disambiguate vagueness in a way that we recognize as steelmanning, and who we trust to speak-off-the-cuff with in safety (warts and all). We can only [[hope]] to do that for the [[other]] sometimes. This is me trying my best, and it might not be enough. I'm going to try anyways. 

<<<
Being a bit of troll yourself keeps others off your ass.
<<<

Sometimes that is warranted. Defection is obligated in some cases, even what appears pre-emptive and baiting too. Mere politeness has this problem as well. I'm not sure if trolling me (which isn't what you are doing; quite the opposite) is likely to keep me off one's ass, but it can. I certainly know what it's like to be at war with most adult humans. I can smell the blood in the water, no doubt. I prefer to be a liferaft rather than a shark. It depends on the context. I keep my shields up too, and I try to make it clear what it costs to fail to speak with me in [[good]] [[faith]] (and, it's costly at any level of [[intimacy]]). I give vampires the extra mile, more than they deserve, because sometimes I'm wrong about their intentions. It's also difficult to prevent arms races. Excepting the closest people in my life (most of whom are already putting their skin in the game as [[PSM]]ers), my price is that we do it in the sunlight. [[Privacy]] with me is extraordinarily rare, and I think that opens me up to some kinds of trolling far more than most people. 

<<<
I have my own disdain for some of the types badphilosophy attracts though I still lurk around because it's still the best a landfill like reddit can offer.
<<<

I can see it. Your defense suggested that. I'm happy to learn more about what you disdain and adore.

Why do you use [[Reddit]]? What's worth picking out of it? Do you have a subscription list I could look at? I primarily lurk as well. [[W5H]] do you read serious philosophy? 

<<<
There's still a lot of reasons "the good" ended up there. 
<<<

I agree there are an uncountable number of reasons even. Do you think there were a lot good reasons it ended up there? 

Considering the number of people who have encountered it, I'm kinda surprised it didn't show up earlier. I appreciate that I've finally made it. 

<<<
It's possible to say more with less words.
<<<

Hrm. 

Show me. 

This can be an [[ideological turing test|Wiki Litmus Test]], if you wish.<<ref "t">> By all means, unburden me: take [[The Good]] and charitably re-write it with at least semantic equivalence.<<ref "d">> I have a decent understanding of what I've said. 

Oh, I admire your claim more than you know. Say more to whom? And, you don't mean just "more" in terms of content, but rather more correctly, right?<<ref "c">> I agree it can be written better for my context, though I'm not convinced it can be in significantly fewer words. Are you sure you aren't talking about my legibility? In my experience, if we aim for lossless compression, you'll have deceptively short, superficially simple, but in reality quite dense and technical passages to unravel.

I encounter your argument often enough, and it reminds me of those who say "you're just playing semantics". Also, you'll have to forgive me, but some argue quite the opposite with me. They prefer the verbosity. You'd be surprised how many people think they are qualified to tell me what my life is {[[About]]}. I [[hope]] to do right by all of you.

I can say just a few words to [[k0sh3k]], and she knows 90% of it instantly.<<ref "r">> But, this is in virtue of decades of her prodigious reading habits and talents (she's a walking encyclopedia) alongside having so much [[shared]] context and conversation that we have those footholds, abstractions, and experiences to be so concise without losing precision. Part of my predicament is that I have to speak with strangers in a strange land, present and future (some of them, presumably, quite adept - I may need to defend myself against some monsters). It makes parsing my words (almost a rhetorical matter) infuriating for many.<<ref "in">> The content adds fuel to that fire.

<<<
If I understand your morality, then the expense of engaging with you is in complete opposition to it.
<<<

Yes, assuming that means what I think it does about you, then you are likely correct. I'm well aware of why beliefs like mine about morality are despised. That is part of my job. Obviously, we can begin with your initial assertion that it is 'my morality' and 'your morality'. Let us be precise. That is as asinine as saying 'my truth' and 'your truth'. What a radical failure to understand these words! Is this what you mean? Sometimes all we can do is retardsplain to each other, and I appreciate that you don't want to live in opposition.

<<<
To be brutally honest, you're in an intellectual basement. 
<<<

XD.

I appreciate that you tell me what you think. But, is it bad? Is it wrong? I definitely spend a lot of time in the basement. I am a basement-dweller. I live next to the foundation of my dwelling out here in the desert. I would like to know more about what you mean by the metaphor. [[This|https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Basement%20Intellectual]]? That sounds about right. That's the path I'm choosing for now. I know it is easy to hate the hiki and his wiki. You must have some intellectual ends in mind. If you want to speak about the justifications of this, I will.

Does it remind you of a massive persecution-fetish-tweaking Adult Swim^^tm^^ bump? (<---I'm trying to be humorous, my friend. Tear me a new one, please. `/hands-you-a-free-pass`. I've been called much worse things by people better than me, and I'm glad of it. Yes, you actually can hurt me.) Maybe I should become an IG model instead. :P. My senpai, Madame [[chameleon]], calls it [[Dargeresque|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Darger]]. I admit I've accepted social defeat on a number of fronts.

This year has been interesting. I've listened quite carefully to my [[Root Users]] (more than some of them believe, imho), and I'm chilling out a bit, trying to give less of a fuck, calm my schiztardations down, slowly adjusting my expectations with my predictions, and so forth. That's what I've been licensed to do, apparently. It's pretty dope. I'm still considering my options. I could leave the basement (some people want me to do that), but y tho?

There's [[this feller|https://french.yale.edu/people/r-howard-bloch]] I [[stumbled across|2020.10.27 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: A Door Opens?]] fairly often last year on my walks with my offspring. I read one of his books (and went through some of his wife's articles [I think she'd find my offspring fascinating]) and gave him copies of my family's wikis (which he didn't look at, though he did check the site out). He's probably being polite, telling us "we are the future" and claiming this ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî± is over his head. But, he promised to have dinner with me this year (I'm not holding my breath) after we had more time to familiarize ourselves with each other's work (said he did this with some Frankfurt fellers too). You think I should go that way? I just don't see the point. I absolutely want my offspring to attend the best schools they can, but I think I'm out (except sneaking into classes: that I am going to do, lawd willing).

The basement is based. Sure, it lacks some kinds of credibility, but that's not my problem in a world that has no interest in assigning that kind of credibility fairly. I think I belong in the basement: my mind is all-too-often in the gutter. I identify as a basement-dweller. Some philosophers do.<<ref "s">>

<<<
I've known a lot of really fucked up people that talked like you and while I have the rare ability to empathize with this kind of stuff on a personal level my sympathy for you is as paltry as what I offer myself.
<<<

Hrm. I haven't, and I've met a lot of very different people (and I read most people under the table). I can find pretentious professors. I can find people who speak in zealous word salad. I can find people who maintain digital gardens. I can find people who write diaries. I can find people who engage in tedious philosophy. I can find [[arrogant]] [[neckbeards]], gamers, weebs, and retards of all kinds. I can find computer touchers. I can find teachers, and parents, and PKs/MKs, and people who check many boxes. I can't say I've found people who talk like me though (although I've seen a lot of comparisons to other authors). Please point me to those who talk like me. Maybe we're back to Sir Terry Davis here. 

I'm definitely fucked up, but again, that doesn't make me wrong. I probably merit far less sympathy. Keep turning it down if you need. I hope you keep saving it for those in much greater need, as you obviously already do. And, yes, I hold that in high regard. I hope you find people you enjoy sympathizing with, and from the sounds of it, I hope you take it easy on yourself too (though I admire how high of a standard you keep yourself to).

<<<
I'm being too harsh but my patience is limited. 
<<<

I can see that in both of us. I think you still are working to be patient with me in your follow-up. I assume you've thought about your response for a while now. I will say that if you don't have patience with me, you shouldn't continue. By all means, don't be too harsh. Why waste your time? I definitely deserve some harsh responses though, and, sometimes, that's the only way anyone learns.

You seem far more patient than most humans I encounter. As they say in some part of the American South: I appreciatcha.

<<<
Your stuff is valuable but likely not for all the reasons you have in mind, and if you want to be better at philosophy, do anything but.
<<<

I do intend for my work to be a gift, and I realize it will be used in ways I would not approve. I've been pleasantly surprised by people who have found it valuable and why. Including the reasons I think it's valuable, you have the best representation of my mind I know how to give with the resources I've had since its creation. I think it's valuable for a variety of reasons. What reasons are you convinced I have in mind? 

You're probably right about at least parts of this. It's rare these days that people talk with me about what it means to be good at philosophy (a conversation that's all too rare anywhere, in my experience). And, clearly, you think continuing what I'm doing is all wrong. Many do. Please explain what it means to do it well. What would you have me do instead and why? I will think carefully about you and your words. 

Would you prefer this style [[2014.11.10 - Challenges in Quasi-Lockean Intellectual Property Theory]]? It's unfortunately deconstructive, and it says too little. Even my enemies liked it though. Is that what you want? I speak here and there about the problems of writing in that style in the institutions available to those interested in engaging in public reason. 

What does it mean to do philosophy well? You don't have to answer these questions. This is what is required for us to move forward though, unless you just want to set these problems aside. If so, you'll have to lead me around what is worth talking about together (and, I apologize for being so autistic that even if you had a wiki like mine, I wouldn't understand it nearly as well as you understand mine). 

<<<
I should probably clarify that I actually do enjoy reading most of your stuff, I just find it infuriating. 
<<<

Yup. I hear that. It seems like I'm on track then. I know what I have to say (and the way I autistically say it) is infuriating. I'm sufficiently clear about that. I know that people have violent reactions to me; I've had to learn to sniff it out too. I'm a zealot. Few can stand to be around such for long.

To be clear, there are very few who have read most of it. I have a difficult time gauging my interlocutors here. I suggest [[k0sh3k]] is the only person who can claim to have read it (and probably only she, [[j3d1h]], and [[Sphygmus]] can claim to have understood half of it). You'd have to have been reading long before our encounter on /r/badphilosophy to have read most of my stuff. Or, and I think more likely, you mean you've enjoyed reading most of what you've read (and I don't know how you explore). I'm glad that even what you hate and find infuriating ([[ITS]]) is something you tend to enjoy (that's fascinating). I doubt that speaks to my abysmal writing skills; it must be you who has radical empathy and high tolerance for what you disagree with. I respect that. You are obviously quite patient.

I [[hope]] to hand you more of what you might find [[salient]]. You get an extremely rare gift, my honored guest. Almost on principle, I don't link to my family's wikis more than I am obligated. I think you might find [[this|https://bookwyrm.quest/#The%20Importance%20of%20Names]] enjoyable (given your presumably hardcore [[gaming|Games]] proclivities and appreciation for both fantasy and philosophy). 

<<<
You mention frequently that you could have a high-profile career, if you so wished, that you could mesh with 'normies,' if you so wished... but have you?
<<<

I suggest you are doing your best not to put words in my mouth, and I will continue to help you in that endeavor. I don't mention that frequently.<<ref "f">> That's not what I meant to say to you either. High-status does not mean high-profile to me. Are you asking if I've pursued higher status, high-culture, or generally well-respected positions? Yes, though I was careful in my approach, and I'm glad I left. However, I have decided to aim for my ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî± to eventually be high-profile, but it's nowhere near ready. I still have to engage people with it until it could be ready, and that poses some odd problems. The way I see it, the average age a philosopher delivers their magnum opus is ~44, and mine is egregiously generalized, systematic, and content-inclusive; presumably it could take much longer.

I did not say I could mesh with normies, though I did say I can appear to. I have wished to mesh with them though, of course, and I still try. I am increasingly convinced of the futility, though I am trying. It's not easy, dude. I h0p3 you'll understand: I'm a Psykotic 4eak, gdoghomes. 

How about you?

<<<
I used to tell myself I could do a lot of things, that I could do anything‚Äîand spent that time putting verbose bullshit on the internet.
<<<

I'm sorry. Yeah, I know this pain. I would be interested to see your verbosity that you disown to some [[dok]].<<ref "i">> I disagree with lots of who I've been, and that's part of who I am too. I'm aware of many of the costs I incur to be verbose on the internet, and I agree that engaging in my work to the extent I do is not for most people (though I think we all have to work to represent ourselves in a democracy).

What do you think is possible for you to do with your remaining lifespan?

<<<
I obviously don't and shouldn't have authority over your life but I do pity you in the way I've loathed myself.
<<<

That is unobvious to me. It doesn't sound like you want to argue about this matter, especially not with me. I think that you do have some degree of authority in several respects, and I think you should in some as well. 

I appreciate you take the time to pity and loathe us.<<ref "pl">> These are expensive tasks and feelings. I can almost guarantee I will continue to stir negative feelings you. You do not have to engage with me, as I've said.

<<<
I see a lot of potential in your work which is what makes its shortcomings and slight hypocrisies all the more frustrating.
<<<

It's difficult to recognize it, but my work serves many purposes. I'm glad you see a lot of potential in it, and I find my work frustrating too. I predict my failure. If you know how to improve my odds of succeeding at the agglomeration of these purposes, please let me know. I ask you to put your skin in the game, and remember that [[Deconstruction Obligates Reconstruction]]. That's a tall task, and it doesn't have to be yours.

<<<
The unwillingness to fully participate in society is entirely justified but you seem averse to participate in literally anything else.
<<<

It's difficult to interpret all that is packed into that sentence (including the ambiguity). What are you claiming I'm averse to? Whose unwillingness are you speaking about? What is full participation in society? Most importantly, why is that entirely justified? These questions are hard to answer, and feel free to ignore them. As you are perhaps pointing out: I don't have consistent and rich access to your thoughts and feelings as you do mine; the asymmetry is non-trivial.

When I look at my [[4DID]], or even just the past 5 years, I'm not sure that would be a fair characterization of me. My service to others has varied considerably. I agree that I continue to narrow how I participate in society, though I consider my participation quite radical (you may need to keep exploring). I predict I will continue to narrow it down, but I'm open to participating in other ways. I can appreciate why it would be difficult for you to know. We can discuss justification if you want. I suggest that (a) you show me you tried to step into my shoes and walk around in them, and (b) you put your own perspective on the line for me to walk around in. 

Setting that aside, I obviously resonate with some version of what you've said. Schizoid-to-schizoid: I have been curling-up for a while now (at least a year). I've done so while working to maintain my side of my relationships despite considerable upheaval in my world (and I'm responsible for a lot of people, and most of my interlocutors live much simpler and more selfish lives [they really don't understand]). I'm taking [[Gradual]]ized [[T42T]] seriously in [[FTO]]. I am almost entirely in [[Reply Mode]], even with my [[Root Users]] (none of us are unblemished, obviously). I've heavily limited how much I'm reaching out to anyone except strangers in the desert, and I work to not generate notifications or rely upon means of production the workers do not own. For most people, my words from my ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî± are the only reaching out I'm doing, and only because I know they've chosen to listen. I regularly find my mistrust of others verified by my receipts, records, and counselors (obviously, I mistrust my own thoughts and feelings too). It's as fair as I know how to be in a gaslit world. 

What do you think you owe to others, and what do they owe you? Again, don't feel compelled to answer my questions. If you think it won't be constructive for either of us, we don't have to go further.

<<<
I'll likely be butchering some of your nuance but if your goal is to spread goodness, and there's no unbreakable communication barrier between yourself and the 'ungifted'‚Äîwhat keeps you from presenting your work in a more accessible form?
<<<

It's okay if you butcher my gibberish sometimes. That's gonna happen, especially since we are new to each other and given the asymmetries between us. That is an uncommitted but fair two-word characterization of my goal. We still have to interrogate those terms together.

What do you mean by unbreakable communication barrier? Do you mean to say we cannot access the Thing-In-Itself? Do you mean to say we cannot be certain that other minds obtain, nor if they are playing language games as we assume or predict they are? I'm a realist about metaphysics too.  

You aren't the only person to say it's not worth the effort. Why should I think I'm not working to present my work in a more accessible form? Are you sure you should help yourself to that claim? Again, I have little reason to think you've seen all that much of my work. Some parts are more accessible than others. Judging the whole is a hard task. There are also many kinds of accessibility to consider here. I make myself as accessible as I know how; I'm physically reachable with anonymized access that I'm held accountable for, and you can engage in dialectics with me to flesh it out (though I expect you to pull your weight). Make no mistake, I'm fully retarded, and becoming fluent in my retardations is an unspeakable hardship. I realize that I won't be able to speak my language with everyone too; I'm doing what I can with what I have. I'm working hard to eliminate gnosticism, though there will always be fundamental problems. 

There are limits to the answers I owe to others who aren't going to search or put their own skin in the game. I've been a poor student many times, expecting my teacher to hand me everything, preferably in a palatable, easy to digest, and enjoyable manner. 

Given what I've already accomplished with it, even if this ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±'s remaining utility only amounted to making it so [[my offspring|BAGD]] don't live through the hell I have, I'd be content. It's sufficiently accessible to them. Even they will read these words at least once, my friend.

<<<
I would assume paranoia as that's what keeps me lying low.
<<<

A fair assumption, and I talk about this matter plenty. Yes, I am quite paranoid. [[Question Everything]] is something I take seriously. I have significant doubts about my [[phenomenology]], and I don't trust most humans will choose to be good people. I consider the ability to lie low to be a [[SO]] privilege (one could imagine the ability to hide while the Nazis are hunting for you to be a kind of privilege when compared to those who cannot hide), and I hope that you are able to lie low when you need it. 

<<<
I get the bodily need to write without mediation, to pen down your soul with your own damn blood as the ink‚Äîthe liberating, immortalizing act of streaming your thoughts to page. These choices are obviously stylistic, a methodical madness‚Äîit's brave to create like this and share unabashedly. I think you'd call it moral.
<<<

That is poetry. Lawd. [[YWSOAM]]. Thank you for [[sharing]] your words.

I think it can be moral, it depends; I think it usually largely is, [[WINTCIS]]. I wish everyone worked to do so well. I think it can be a generous act, and even a radical participation in democracy. It's quite a commitment. I think the world would be a very different place if everyone had to make a ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî± in public to live with, [[share]], and communicate through. 

<<<
All in all I think the differences between us are more personal than ideological and two angry schizophrenics easily become an unstoppable force and immovable object. 
<<<

`/bow`. 

I do my best not to bring the earned fury that I have for our species to the table with each individual. I try not to blend the collective with the individual, and instead to treat each person as their own that I must learn to model, [[WINTCIS]]. It's hard to do as a schizo. It's easy to trigger me, no doubt, as though the individual before me must pay for the sins of everyone who has committed a similar sin against me. I think you know that I know you know that I know we have that unstoppable force and immovable object problem in front of us. `/wink`. I aim to help and praise you as best I can, nomad. 

Ultimately, I do not know what the differences are between us. It's not clear to me you've seen enough of me, and I know I've not seen enough of you. I don't know what you mean by a distinction between the personal and the ideological. I'm prepared to wrestle all the way down, in anger or otherwise. I doubt we will, but who knows? 

<<<
Not sure where to take this moving forward.
<<<

I believe you [[aim]]ed to do me justice. Moving forward requires putting your skin in the game with me. I gotta say, not many people are interested in committing themselves. I wander on the assumption that people aren't actually looking to move forward lifelong with me. Some people stay around the fireside for a few minutes, some for a few months, and some for a few years. I hope to be fittingly useful to all even while I'm ISO Satisfying LTRs üíØ. You have been through hell; so I think it's fine if you are [[silent]] with me. You have the chance to quietly watch and decide, nomad. No matter what, again, I appreciate having met you. And, I hope we do get to speak more and openly so. 

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]

You're talking about maintaining equivalence (or at least the same degree of salience), including precision, yet with increased concision. That compression is something I wrestle with quite a bit. I've had [[Root Users]] concerned I'm compressing too much, some concerned I say too much, and some who think I just need to say it however I think I should say it.">>

<<footnotes "pl" "Perhaps you can relate further. Some days I feel kinship with Dostoevsky's narrator of //Notes from Underground// (assuming I even understand, which is worth doubting considerably). I have huge bitter, misanthropic (appearing) streaks in me. I don't live alone (I'm beyond fortunate), but at least to some, my 'novel' appears to consist in confused or contradictory notes, memoirs, and confessions describing my and [[others]]' antagonistic theories of alienation from contemporary society. I don't loathe my whole self (though some parts), and, at this point, I don't loathe my local position (though I think my voice should be heard). I'm a partially sick and unattractive man, but I think I'm sufficiently justified on my end of those relational evaluations. I've got enough salient knowledge under my belt to think it does account for parts of my misery, but that's in virtue of empathy with Humanity + feeling the responsibility of it rather than in virtue of my local situation. I do think the privileged have no excuse not to be educated, and the educated should feel the misery of the world, to be motivated by it accordingly (and, it's clearer to me that the privileged and the educated tend to do neither [my [[wife|k0sh3k]] is an eternal well in the desert; she helps me know what is possible]). I'm not disillusioned with philosophy //tout court//, but I am disillusioned with what we've done with our philosophical pursuits and knowledge. I don't consider my existence mundane whatsoever, but absurd, yes. I maintain my idealism and [[hope]], with effort, mind you. Of course, like any decent human, I hold [[utilitarianism|Smelting Muh Silly Farts: ìÇ∫]] in contempt (nihilism and egoism are some of my key targets, ofc), but I admit the necessity of wielding logical proofs, technology, mathematics, and scientific evidence to align our desires with our justified interests. I agree with what may be this Underground Man's assessment that in the will to power, to extend one's Spinozan essence for this sake of extending it, people unjustifiably use their freewill merely to feel unique, authentic, and free-appearingly unpredictable (#notliketheotherhumans, #justsorandom). I don't loathe what I have crystallized in character and the inertia of my identity nearly as much as he does. I'm only a cynic of [[beauty]] insofar as I know there is something higher. Do you feel like Liza in how you pity me? I don't see myself deciding to stop writing, but I did question it. Your words matter to me.">>
