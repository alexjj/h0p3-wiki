title: 2021.08.27 - Prompted Introspection: For we all fall short...

//I will remind you that the virtuous agent may be inarticulate and even unable to immediately interpret this kind of gibberish in some cases. It's all JuSt FOR thE luLz anyways, right? Forgive me, Saint Kant. This is an unhinged, Kamehamehaic ideological turing test. I summon a forked golem (step right up and get blasted), and I think the amounts of straw and steel suspiciously vary with the interpreter.//

!! Do you believe the set of concepts like "duty", "should", "obligation", and "deserving" are ultimately more valid or meaningless?<<ref "ou">>

I don't understand the question, and I won't respond to it.<<ref "il">> Those words don't mean anything,<<ref "w">> especially not to me.<<ref "a">>

Meaningless, Samwise.<<ref "t">> Validity is a subjective spectrum computed in spacedust, dude. This is all a [[hope]]less pursuit; like, you have no idea.<<ref "p">> In reality, meaning, to me, is a probabilistic emotive [[word game|2021.08.20 - Anonymous: It's Been Real]] between [[competing|Instrume]] limbic systems in a multi-[[cult]]ural meatgrinder,<<ref "a2">> of course.<<ref "j">> What sort of delusional narcissist would believe they could possibly know what they are supposed to do at any juncture in life, if there even were such a thing to know? Don't you think it lacks humility to ever even imply that what we do with our lives really matters?<<ref "g">> No, no: it is enlightened and "better" to say, "pst, no one knows what they are doing in life because there is nothing to know, `/wink`." 

I've also met bad people who claim to believe in morality,<<ref "bp">> and that's how I know I shouldn't put too many resources into thinking about it.<<ref "cp">> Even if I did want to feel like I cared about something that mattered, I'd prefer to use different words,<<ref "cm">> and I'd try to keep the bar low and the rules as simple, vague, and ambiguous as possible so that I wouldn't feel bad or motivated by them unless it didn't cost me too much.<<ref "o">> I wouldn't want to be a hypocrite.<<ref "gf">>

Srsly tho, y would you let it eatcha up and cause you anxiety, Samwise?<<ref "c">> Plus, it makes me uncomfortable when you do that.<<ref "h">> Are you looking to be happy or not? I choose from beliefs and desires (wait, I don't believe in that either, lmao)<<ref "cc">> based on whether or not they make me happy (e m b r a c e psychological egoism),<<ref "y">> and even that is a social construct<<ref "t2">> (like, it's totally just a bunch of constructions inside ~~your~~ ~~our~~ my brain anyway, and I can't really know what's outside it),<<ref "in">> [[ITS]]. Why even try to ask why even try?<<ref "i">> Just be chill, man.<<ref "b">> Lay off that morality shit because it will [[drive you crazy|66912]] and make you sad. Unless I'm having a good time, I'd rather not have any strong feelings about the issue.<<ref "pc">> Can we just not talk about it instead? 

So, did you catch the sportsball game over the weekend? Bro, it was //so// good!

<<footnotes "ou" "Not that it 'matters', but I thought you should know that's a really 'well'-formed question. Don't forget 'ought', 'merit', 'normative', and all the [[others]]. Them's a bunch of dangerous and intolerant words, and, hypothetically, we categorically 'need' to round up their users to eliminate them.">>

<<footnotes "il" "I'm a person of action, not words. I'm not pretentious enough to debate this because I'm far more concerned with being //practical//, having fun while learning useful facts, evaluating each idea on its own merit, and applying what I learn however I feel like it. Anyway, outraged moralizers who just want to feel superior are more worried about the perfection of their quotes than the perfection of their self, so that's how you know morality is just a scam. If they really wanted to be effectively altruistic, they would never talk about it. Show, don't tell (as we all know, telling can never be a showing, by, like, definition).">>

<<footnotes "w" "And, actually, in all fairness and with all due respect, truth be told, as a matter of fact, if I'm being real, if I have the permission to speak freely [to make it clear, bluntly lay it on the line, shoot from the hip, sincerely speak my mind, and set the record straight], frankly, tbh, nor do these either, [[ITS]]. If it did mean anything, it would be ugly; and, I care more about how it appears than what it is.">>

<<footnotes "a" "And, quit projecting! Jesus. You're not tricking anyone.">>

<<footnotes "t" "[[Trust]] me. I'm a man of science, so I don't really believe in anything ([[YSB]]). Well, I mean, I believe in meaning, maybe, but only when it is divorced from normativity and metaphysics. Maybe you could call me an axiological hedonist? I've memorized dozens of talking points from Youtube videos that agree with me. You need to watch more theory.">>

<<footnotes "p" "Your gaslighting question is pointless and disrespectful. I only believe in meaning when it's useful to me, so clearly, you're just: playing semantics, archaically virtue signaling, overthinking, engaged in authoritarianism and obfuscation, dogmatically strawmanning me because you want to be 'right', and being unrealistic (just get over it, and stop being so sensitive). Wake up! Meaning is a resentful illusion of consensus for performative sheep and a fantasy perpetuated by generations of people who have doubled down on a pleasant fiction written by bronze age control freaks commodifying the herds of our species with incoherent mental viruses. Not to be edgy, but I'm a rebel, and I'm not falling for that shit. I'd rather die on my owns terms than sacrifice for an[[other]]'s.">>

<<footnotes "a2" "And, therefore, also for you, and, make sure you don't impose any of your beliefs on me, because that's wrong!">>

<<footnotes "j" "Just as we are piles of atoms shuffling other piles of atoms around, I'm positive about this.">>

<<footnotes "g" "I mean, I guess it's fine if you believe it for you, act like it's real, and 'live your truth' or whatever, as long it doesn't hurt me or affect me in a way I don't like, and, then, at that point, who I am to care what you think and do?">>

<<footnotes "bp" "Hipsters, schizos, and fundies, mostly. I've also never met a saint (you wouldn't catch me ever hanging out with those sorts of people anyway [they have the wrong vibe]), so that's how I know they don't exist.">>

<<footnotes "cp" "And, in the end, I'm kinda proud that I don't pose as an intellectual about this issue.">>

<<footnotes "cm" "It just seems so committal, and I'm not ready for that right now. It's too much pressure. Morality just isn't gentle enough to suit my style. Instead, let me nebulously speak of balance and harmony. Like, I just want to be a decent person, not a good one; that would make me happy. Basically, as long I'm at least a bit better than the average person, then I won't feel like the problem (at least I'm not the worst, right?) and my status gives me pleasure.">>

<<footnotes "o" "When I do believe in these things, I now have somewhere to point. Don't you know that deontology is a confabulation according to neuroscience? Moral anti-realism is surely more rational by comparison, unless we're all just slaves to our passions no matter what. Of course, if I didn't act like I believed in these things once in a while, people wouldn't [[like]] me as much, and I'd have a harder time getting what's mine. Really, the trick is to have my cake and eat it too, so, what I do is: I lie to myself at just the right moments so that I can feel like a good enough person. And, I //am// a [[good]] person, dude.">>

<<footnotes "gf" "I don't really believe [[good]] [[faith]] anything is possible or that pursuing such a thing is valuable, coherent, or sufficiently meaningful.">>

<<footnotes "c" "I'm certain that pursuing certainty to any degree is bad for your health. And, if you don't have your health, like, what's the point?">>

<<footnotes "h" "Have you thought about my feelings here? You and your question are [[toxic]].">>

<<footnotes "cc" "[[Cypher's Choice]] is non-extantly juicy and delicious.">>

<<footnotes "y" "Yeah, when I am being 'moral' it's because it makes me happy. I'm good to the people I live with because it benefits me. The person who lives on the other side of world doesn't have any reasons that I want to take as valuable reasons in my weighing about what I ~~should~~ want to do with my resources though.">>

<<footnotes "t2" "I'm sure you've heard the phrase: 'I think, therefore I am.'">>

<<footnotes "in" "And, when I really think deeply about it, using the same epistemic standard, I guess I can't really know what's inside either. If it were real, it wouldn't really matter. Ashes to ashes, dust in the wind. ">>

<<footnotes "i" "To [[infinigress]], ofc.">>

<<footnotes "b" "I have better things to do with my time than worry about morality, Dostoevsky.">>

<<footnotes "pc" "It's so much more peaceful in my life when I don't have to think about it. It's not like I have any [[power]] to do anything about this problem anyway.">>
