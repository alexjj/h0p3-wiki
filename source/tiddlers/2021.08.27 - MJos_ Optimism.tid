<<<
I’ve been meaning to write you again for a little while now, but it has been very busy moving to a new house.
<<<

It's my pleasure to hear from you, and we connect when we can, sir. I [[hope]] life can slow down some for you.
I know how expensive it can be to move and prep for school. Is it something you've had to do often in life? 

<<<
I am now in Santa Cruz and have been for about six weeks. Make sure to update the part of your webpage that says where I live.
<<<

Done, sir. Your sacrifice is noted. 

<<<
The chance of me going to grad school, as you ask in one of your recent letters, is 100%. The chance of me actually getting through it will depend on how well I can do with the Dragon dictation software, which the disability center set me up with a free copy of. It’s definitely a cut above the Alternatives. Writing papers, at least, should be no problem.
<<<

Sick. You're going to fucking destroy it, dude. I'd very much like to hear about what you learn and what you make. I know it's expensive to talk about the story of being there too, for various reasons, but perhaps one day I could hear that as well. I adore school (and despite what all the retards I know who say they learn better on their own online might say, and despite my many reservations about political [[power]] manifest today, I still fucking adore school like a simp<<ref "[]D[][]V[][]D">>). 

<<<
As for writing code… Well, there a third party plug-ins for dragon that sit between the voice layer and the command execution layer, and let you speak a whole new set of commands for coding and various programming languages. Said sets of commands have been implemented already, so it’s just a matter of learning to use them… Anyway, the point is it’s all out there and I just have to get better at it. I’ve been preoccupied with moving in, and making the new apartment my own, but now I can settle down to a month or so of intensive practice with dragon and that should be all I need to feel confident. I’m actually pretty optimistic.
<<<

Optimistic. Yes. Good. My gut instinct, of course, is still: ugh, but like, if it does work (and it might even turn out better in the long-run), that would be amazing. I guess my hedged-conservative [[hope]] is that you find yourself writing software that has little boilerplate and requires you to spend most of your time thinking about which 10 lines you need to write that week. Coding marathons from your flowstate might be all but destroyed until your hands grow bad enough that maybe the surgery will occur (or, if [[lucky]], you'll have found a painless yet effective way to push and pull from the parts of your mind in your brain to the parts in the boxes outside your flesh machine). Well, okay, I'll stop worrying. You're gonna make it work. For the [[love]] of the [[monster]].

<<<
Apologies for not addressing any particular points that were in your previous letters as I don’t have your website open right now my phones about to die. 
<<<

Nothing to apologize for, sir. I am jelly that you can even use your phone well enough to write a message to me. I'm completely incompetent on my phone, worse than a boomer. I wouldn't open the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 on it either (I do so only under duress); if it can even be opened on such a device, surely it will kill it.<<ref "m14">>

<<<
I always feel like, when I read what you write, that I could reply to almost every single paragraph.
<<<

Yeah, I see that. And, of course, I am a greedy sumbitch.<<ref "y">> I'd enjoy thinking about what you have to say, but I know there is never enough time. If there comes a point where it is suitable to you, you may have my voice and ear to [[ltf]]. 

<<<
Indeed, I’ve seen you do that with Kicks, chameleon, and other PSM peeps. Forgive me if I don’t live up to that standard, if my email blasts tend to mostly just be me rambling and only occasionally returning to your points. It’s not how I want to be. But I figure, suboptimal contact is better than no contact, and it’s so easy for me to lead email messaging and friend contact go if I’m not careful about it but I would rather just send something off. To let you know that I’m thinking of you.
<<<

Naw, you're all good, homie. You do put way more skin in the game with me than the vast majority I have the honor of speaking with, and that's despite lacking the full use of your hands. I beg you not to ask for forgiveness:<<ref "a">> you've done nothing wrong. I talk too much, and you should filter and ignore it where fitting. You've gotta pick out what is [[salient]] for us. And, I prefer to hear your ramblings to mine.<<ref "mine">> You're extremely bottlenecked, so it's my chance to hear your story with the resources you've got.

I am a retarded and overprivileged hermit, so I learn how to socialize differently than most people. In this case, through [[stoic]]ally ignoring my expectations and instead adapting with my predictions to update my prescriptions,<<ref "m">> I have removed my ability to complain in many respects. I'm [[grateful]] that I have done so, and I am still working to understand what it means to be a hiki well. As part of my curl-up, and excepting perfect moral obligations, I am in [[Reply Mode]], even with my [[Root Users]]. Limiting my initiation and the generation of notifications while acking people what they are owed in a baker's dozen has enabled communications to more simply be a gift. It is a luxury to be able to do so, and I hope everyone finds it sufficiently relieving.

<<<
Tomorrow is my birthday.
<<<

Don't forget to tell me the year you were born so we can add it to your person page. Last four digits, birth city, your hawtest elementary school teacher's name and address, and mother's maiden (it's okay if they are the same)<<ref "o">> are also highly desired. Board up your windows, let your pet taste your food first, and the SIM swap is incoming, so I recommend cold storage. :P

Happy birthday, Maxwell. Time is flying by. I'm [[blinking|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qmVNB4nalk]] and chunks disappear. It's quite a non-mere [[vidya]] [[game]], sir.

<<<
I will spend the whole day working on DND, and coding, and maybe walking by the beach. Then at night I will drink alcohol and go dancing. It will be a very good day.
<<<

I hope your geek productivity gets the birthday boost, that you get laid, do some blow (always wanted to try some), meet new people in your new city, and have a chance to reflect. `/salute`. May it be a good one, my drongo.
