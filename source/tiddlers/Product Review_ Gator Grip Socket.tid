* 5/5
** Remarkable. I don't give a shit about the wrench (seems fine); I'm talking about the socket. It's dirt cheap for what you get.
*** Though I've only had mine for a couple years, so I can't speak to its longevity. 
** I'm not convinced a toolbox, even (and especially) a small one, is complete without it. 
** I know, I know: no real craftsman would be caught dead with some cheatyfaced jankass "As Seen On TV" gadget. It's the real deal though. Set aside your pride and give it a spin. It's a different tool.
** I could imagine evolutions for impact, sizing, and even grip on the tool are possible, but it's excellent as is.
*** Perhaps it's not deep enough, but I wouldn't want it oversized in many cases either (it already has a tough time fitting in some places, but that is the way of sockets). 
**** Though having multiple sizes of this socket would make sense to me. 
*** Lord knows what a Snap-On set of these could do.
* Not a replacement, but not replaceable
** Some folks may consider this a replacement for socket sets (and even other wrenches). Perhaps it could in an ugly pinch (competing with other versatile wrenches/pliers like crescent, channellock, and perhaps visegrips), but I don't believe it's meant to. It does, however, often save you a trip to find your combination wrenches or socket set plenty.
** This is the only socket in my tote, and it does the trick a surprising amount of the time. 
*** It's my goto unless I could not afford to damage the hardware (in which case, the fitted tool is the only correct answer).
** It works on stuff that nothing else works on (or not with a ratchet otherwise). Its flexibility is precisely why it cannot be replaced.
** Someone doing commercial or industrial construction would probably only use this for non-standard bolts or to remove bolts that were broken, rusted, or misshapen. I think even a professional would find it useful in plenty of cases though. 
*** Everyone has their pocketpicks and hax, and this is a fine one to have in the arsenal.
** This seems dumb, but in action it feels right: you don't have to place it perfectly (or you can jimmy with it to land the grip you want), and placing+turning something where you don't have to be dead-on [[ltf]]. I like being able to just slap it on there with little frustration. It's a socket: it's meant to make your life easy.
*** There seem to be cases where not being dead-on is the best method.
*** I could imagine manufacturing that would rely on this for speed and either worker or robotic imprecisions.
* Authenticity
** You may want to just buy this one in-person, offline. Because it is mechanical, I would feel less comfortable receiving a knock-off.
