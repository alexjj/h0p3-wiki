11:49:06 AM [[011001]]: hi
12:25:12 PM [[h0p3]]: Hello =)
12:25:32 PM [[h0p3]]: What brings you here today? How do you like [[DarkMX]]?
12:25:40 PM [[011001]]: it's pretty cool so far
12:25:48 PM [[011001]]: i'm all about sharing :)
12:25:55 PM [[h0p3]]: Huge fan of that practice.
12:26:40 PM [[h0p3]]: There's not a lot of file-[[sharing]] tools that come with good proxy right out of the box.
12:27:43 PM [[h0p3]]: You are correct; it is a shame it is not FLOSS. I [[hope]] [[papa smurf is real]] will [[change]] their mind.
12:27:44 PM [[011001]]: right, I came here from retroshare
12:28:13 PM [[h0p3]]: I'm [[h0p3]] on there too. https://philosopher.life/#Contact%20h0p3

hiÔøº

h0p3
12:34 PM

Hello =)

011001
12:36 PM

just looking at your website

h0p3
12:37 PM

You can download it for offline viewing (also works quite well in Tor Browser, you only have to connect once to load the whole thing in your browser).

h0p3
12:37 PM

I'm happy to read anything of yours as well. It's often how I get to know people.

011001
12:37 PM

way ahead of you, already in the tor browserÔøº

h0p3
12:38 PM

DopeÔøº

011001
12:38 PM

i'm too lazy to write nowadaysÔøº

h0p3
12:38 PM

I know the feel.

h0p3
12:38 PM

What do you enjoy doing with your time?

011001
12:38 PM

i've got dogs

011001
12:38 PM

and a small garden with some tropical fruit

h0p3
12:38 PM

I'm sure they keep you busy. Lots of walking, I assume.

011001
12:39 PM

indeed

h0p3
12:39 PM

Very nice. We're working on our [[garden]] as well. Will be a while before we get anything. Winter has lasted much longer than we had hoped (so our seedlings may not be out in the open early enough).

011001
12:39 PM

any idea n what you plan on growing?

011001
12:39 PM

*on

h0p3
12:41 PM

We got some pawpaw trees going, a yaupon plant, going for some tomatoes and different kinds of peppers. Also, bunch of different berry bushes.

h0p3
12:41 PM

I am not good with plants. We'll see how it goes. 

h0p3
12:41 PM

How about you?

011001
12:43 PM

i have a few pawpaw trees, coconut, mango

h0p3
12:43 PM

Just need some rum.

011001

i see you use briar \o/

Invite sent. 

<br>

[[h0p3]]:

Yo. =)

[[011001]]:

Hello friend

[[h0p3]]:

It's a rare opporunity to connect with someone over multiple tools that I respect all in one shot. 

I have a hard time convincing anyone to even try these tools out.

[[h0p3]]:

What kinds of computer things are you into? I aint good with them, but I like 'em a lot. 

[[011001]]:

Linux and open source software in general

[[h0p3]]:

`/nod`. It's a good place to be.

[[011001]]:

And yourself?

*also place a premium on privacy

[[h0p3]]:

I wander a lot of topics. Spend a good bit of time just reading. [[Link Log]] is a rich source of my habits, preferences, interests on this topic (and [[Computing]] too). I'm looking for tools that would form the basis of high-functioning, liquid democracy. 

My interests in computing are politically and morally charged, but that's what I think being human is often about, even if mediated over these kinds of objects.

Huge fan of Linux. Obligatory, as the meme goes, I do currently Arch. XD.

(sheer laziness*)

[[011001]]:

Kek. I did arch for a over a decade

Void and tails are my go to distros nowadays

[[h0p3]]:

`/nod`. Excellent tools.

Whonix is also something I hold in high regard, though you can do a Void workstation VM.

[[011001]]:

I like it in theory. Never had occasion to use it.

[[h0p3]]:

[[The Bootable USB Thumbdrive]] might be of interest. 

[[011001]]:

I'm unfamiliar with cabal

How does it compare with session and briar?

[[h0p3]]:

https://cabal.chat - It uses Dat (now Hypercore) for something like a mutable torrents based groupchat.

It is in alpha, at best. It does not serve the same purposes as a Session or a Briar. 

[[011001]]:

Ah, good to know

[[h0p3]]:

But, the person who made Dat, Sir pfrazee, has restructured the protocol to make it more capable of being routed over tools like i2p and Tor. There is a chance that cabal will go this direction. 

[[011001]]:

üëç

[[h0p3]]:

Aether is the only other competitor, in my view. A very worthy attempt at P2P Reddit.

[[011001]]:

Sounds promising.

I've been using lemmy a lot more of late.

[[h0p3]]:

`/nod`. Hard to find replacements for plebbit.

I'm glad to see all the hard work that goes into this space. 

You'd think that after so many decades of computing, we'd have finally figured out the best ways to chat, post, or send a file. Maybe in a few more, assuming we've got the time, we'll get there.
