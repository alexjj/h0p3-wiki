The only way to ensure that each group will have its own independent base of power from which to negotiate the terms of a working alliance is when individual [[power]] equality engineering largely succeeds. Otherwise, you still don't have coalitions of the willing.

Don't let people realize you exist, make no impression, keep your head down, look busy, casually avoid eye-contact, assess without revealing, don't draw attention, prevent confrontation, blend-in, codeswitch, behaviorally camoflauge, and lie when you must: look and sound normal, unprofitable, mundane, plain, and forgettable. When speaking with anyone outside your circle of trust, keep any out-of-the-ordinary political or world views to yourself. Ask the same questions and pose the same answers as everyone else. Stay away from those who are dangerous. Hide all traces of your weaknesses and desirable resources. Don't let people know you're prepared.

Housing cannot be both a money-making investment and remain affordable. Those whose housing comprises the majority of their net worth will be more likely to advocate for policies that increase their property values. And, in crisis, only the giant creditors will get a bailout as they repossess their rented-in-all-but-name collateral. We will be 'taxed' by nobility simply because its 'theirs'. The workers must own the means of production, and that includes their housing.

In a failed society, almost nobody wants to hear what you have to say; without malleable and robust reciprocation, they only want to tell you what's important to or about their own lives, according to them. Insofar as the simulations of conversations can be reduced to two people looking at each other merely waiting for their turn to talk, you might as well exclusively exchange unadaptive pre-writing instead of engaging in live discussion because it requires zero listening (hence non-trivial sections of the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱). Most people are performatively deceiving themselves and each other into accepting a civil fiction that empathic communication is actually occurring. Without that fiction, people would have to own up to the terrible truth. Of course, it's not nice to call people unkind, but it's also unkind to conflate niceness with kindness.
