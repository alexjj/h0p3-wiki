title: 2020.12.19 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Bedroom Push

* Try To Take Over The World
* Fireman Time!
* Drinks and crackers
** A mistake. Ugh. I can feel it in my chest.
* Sleep by 5?
* Woke at Noon
** Shit sleep. Half-brained. Not zombie though, thankfully.
* Try To Take Over The World
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Welp, oil rep did not come out. We don't know why. Now it's important to find a replacement, and sooner rather than later. 
** I do not want that heater dying on us for lack of maintenance, but I need a professional (not easy to find for these old machines).
** I am now going to ration oil.  
* Surprising [[FTO]] pops.
* [[MTG]]
** Wife's Thresh vs. Affinity (I don't pick): Didn't daze t1 drum, two MoE by t3. 
** Wife's Thresh vs. Goblins: Mancer and burn fittingly on lackeys and chief (including a burn on lone lackey with incinerator on the stack for delver), difficult because she's running out of gas to redzone me (still came close). I was lucky to be flooded on land and hit 3 leaders. Caverns was a bitch, and the CA pumped too much. She simply can't switch roles in her position, and she can't control long enough.
* Desk delivery! I'm gonna wait a bit. My room functions enough.
* Wife's Bookclub was today, and she almost forgot about it (that is extremely surprising; what am I missing?). 
** Listened to women I know (except one) talk about their lives. They definitely don't want to know what I think.  
* Try To Take Over The World
* //Skintime// nap, but she basically just held me until I was nearly asleep.
** We were both tired. She especially has no "can" left in her. Cannot even can. I'm glad she can blob; she needs to. Unfortunately, she lacks the ability to nap.
*** And, the noises of the house are waking her up. I don't know how to protect her sleep further beyond ear protection that she won't wear. 
** Nap hit the spot.
* Coffee+Walk+Talk
* Windows PowerToys on [[m18]]
** The ability to move apps between spaces by hotkey fixes a giant problem for me. 
* Organizing and Unpacking Bedrooms
** I'm kinda losing my mind with my offspring. I have been rational, charitable, and patient. They continue to spend my energy and ignore me likes it's nothing. Dialectures, whips cracked, throats slit, and shit got done instead.
** Daughter's
*** Her new shelf (the one she bought) fits like a glove below her ladder. Gives her an extra surface, like an L-shaped desk (not pretty, but functional).
*** Have her table set up, yet another surface. Seems perfect for art. Trying to keep the radiator clear (and her toes warm as a bonus).
*** Her bookshelf is stuffed with books. It gives me [[hope]]. 
**** Read woman. You will forget much of what I've said (as you have many times), and those will be useful for us to iterate a stronger structure (one that will last).
*** She needs one more large shelf. That would fix her problems. 
**** We both hope I will not end up doing it for her. The ball must get rolling; so-called intrinsic motivation is hard.
**** One more solid push, and it will function. Two more, and it'll be pretty.
***** As she knows (from years of hearing me babble), the goal is to build something that doesn't require significant maintenance, something that is default functional with the least investment, and that which encourages good habits. 
*** Ranga is stressed; he's not used to being inside so much. I'm glad he feels extra comfortable in her drawers and bed. 
*** Still doesn't have her laptop set. It is yet another eternal passive aggressive struggle with her (and my son's phone the same). 
**** As I have said countless times, you owe us a working machine during [[Family Time]] (and more). 
** Son's
*** His room smells bad (not a slight odor, an overpowering one). It literally burned my lungs (I barely have a sense of smell), like it was spicy(?). Aired it out, laundry, continued discussion of what it means to own ourselves, personal space limits, requirements in living with others, etc. 
*** He continued to fail to try again and again. Took down his wall of [[privacy]]. You must earn it back.  
**** I will continue to escalate. 
**** Finally protected his screen and loaded up the tooling. Talked about the weld we'll attempt and the basic scientific principles.
*** Huge improvements, shelving makes way more sense, and we can finally walk through the spiral.
*** I think one more pass, and he'll have the room the way he wants it. 
**** Wiring and securing his screen will be significant problems for him. Autists have trouble tying their shoes (and even I hate disentangling cords); it's a test for him. I know my predictions.
** Wife's
*** I am glad to be able to directly service her. So much of my work is for [[others]] or our offspring. I am glad that I get to make it for her. Maybe in a month it will be like a {[[Dream]]} for her. 
*** I am leaving myself one nightstand. Nobody wants to see my toys in the open, lol. 
*** Her clock is far too bright and blue (and it reset out of the blue, oddly, again). Can't be good for her sleep.
*** Personal libraries have had their sorting and shelving (though not LC or whatever she prefers yet). 
**** We lack bookends again (somehow), but I like what I did. 
*** Remade a special space for Meow. Her breed is more den-oriented, and she needs to hide often. It's padded for her, some toys, can reach the center of the bed. Some peekaboo available to her. 
*** Walking item by item through my hoarder's hoard. I probably got halfway through the initial step. 
**** We can walk through the room again. Yas.
**** Tchotchkes have a perfect place in the living room (unusable space for anything else, maybe someone did that on purpose). 
*** Aiming for a desk built around sewing, beads, curriculum, text art, and a literal office. Shelving above should do the trick.
*** When she has a place for things, she keeps it.
* Chilled with wife, argued with offspring.
* Try To Take Over The World

It was a lazy afternoon. Everyone got some serious chill time in. We the unemployed probably should have been working, but noone wanted too, understandably. It's not like we are pushing a manic pace. I'm glad we have some slowdown. A few more pushes, and my offspring will be largely off the hook (though, they know how I think they should spend their time). 

My wife is pushing back about the aesthetics of the house (though the structuring not so much). It is her house, of course. My goal is make her happy and to make it so I will not be necessary.

The square footage on our standard living space is not huge, but the basement and attic + having the resources to organize has given us breathing space like we've not had since 2007. 13 years has taught me many things. I am so [[grateful]] to be able to walk inside. I'm still taken back (multiple times a day) by the space we have. It is enormous privilege. 

I've been getting a lot more boops and liver pokes from my offspring. It's a playful, disarming gesture. I'm glad. No matter how serious I may be, they have a route to a soft spot.
