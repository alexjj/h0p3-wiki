//MORTAL KOMBAT! [[MU|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_(negative)]] YAAA!<<ref "ÁÑ°">> Reveal yourself to me, nomad. Here you face my vindicating shadowwrestler proxy. I'd take pleasure in guttin' you, [[boi|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QihhtktsLA]], and I'd eatcha up. Never forget: I am __always__ in an argument with you. I don't need weapons; I'll take with you my bare words. Are you ready to head down the rabbithole? Be woke with me. It is my honor to carry you across the finish line. With ideally as little cynicism as we are morally obligated, let us teach each other the value of honesty wisely. Let us be students of [[Humanity]] together. Even in adversarial collaboration, bully'n'pully me [[right]]. As [[fff]]ingly best as we know how, let us live to tell what is [[salient]] {[[about]]} the truth together always. We must fight for our relationships with each [[other]] until we are as unified and coherent as we ought. They say a society that separates its scholars from its warriors will have its thinking done by cowards and its fighting by fools. So, let us wrestle the angels, leviathans, and turtles all the way down together, nomad!//

Socializing is often the art of accepting, agreeing to, and enabling pleasant fictions. I admire fiction only in virtue of what it accomplishes non-fictionally. I admire [[smalltalk]] exclusively in virtue of how it opens doors to justified [[intimacy]]. I do not wish to live in a mere experience machine, though I aim to be moral even in multi-agent simulations.

I am like a hermitically insulated and far less intelligent [[WWDD]] blindly wandering the online desert with my ~~lamp~~ wiki,<<ref "mc">> a shittily implemented palantiric and pantopticonal simulated [[TOP]] [[Ring-of-Gyges|ROG]] Mirroring+Prisming Image, an experience-machine machine, asking people what they see in it, in me, in themselves, and in the external world. Like my masters and the gom jabbar, "I am just looking for a ~~human being~~ [[good]] person." Yes, at first, it looks dark-triadic for a person to constantly force you into a mode of public reasoning about who we really are and questioning the nature of reality together. Reason is exactly what I respect in your autonomy, nomad. 

You must be frustrated by the game of reason; I know I often am. It is so exhausting to [[Question Everything]]. I am engaged in a golden-ruled [[T42T]] process with you. Consider this an implementation of [[The Original Position]] methodology. My wiki is an exhausting grindstone, and you are most welcome. I sift humans for Humanity, and I sift persons for real [[friend]]s who empathize with me. I lovingly denounce you all while paradoxically making myself obscenely vulnerable, and now I will see which relationships matter. I take no psychopathic prisoners in my [[Wiki Litmus Test]]; it is the only safe option now. This is a tool for helping me improve my dyadic meta-accuracy, improve my own models for improving my theory of my computational mind, and to literally maximize the odds of successfully [[Finding The Others]].

We must engage in science with each other to understand the theory of each others' minds. This is a sane way to think about those around me. I guard my approval-seeking with avarice because it is prudent. If you don't like my wiki, then you don't like me. That is obviously true. Yet, I suggest there's a non-trivial [[chance]] you aren't justified in not liking at least some aspects of my wiki (and you may not know which is which).

What happens to me if I fail your test? This is a matter of [[Trusting Trust]]. Are you ready to put your money where your mouth is? Don't be a hypocritical chickenshit pansy. If you expect me to be willing to be wrong all the way down, then in [[T42T]] I expect the same standard of you (and I do!).

If we are the opposite of friends, then I want you to consider [[Why You Might Hate Me]]. I'm not here to be your doormat, and hopefully, you aren't here to be mine. I'm done playing useless language games with others, at least for a while (maybe it will be safe enough one day to come out and play<<ref "cs">>). Perhaps I'm the hermitic persona non grata, but I worry you willingly choose to be xenomemephobic (if not outright unjustifiably selfish). Perhaps you have objectively put forth more effort into being a good person than I have; perhaps you are just flat out better at being a person than I am. I'm listening to your argument. Let us draw the lines in the sand together.

I entreat you: come wander the desert with me; travel down the rabbithole. It's easy to dismiss me, and it's hard to empathize with me. I'm profoundly weird at times, and I know how most humans treat aliens. Thus, in my [[T42T]] approach, I aim to be forgivingly retaliating in our game-theoretic attempt at cooperation. I must warn you, however, that I'm a shark swimming in my own ocean (delusional or otherwise); pick your battles wisely, and take care not to drown yourself. 

It takes time to develop an [[intimate]] relationship, to engage in profound dialectics way down deep, to form consensus and cross-polinate our disagreement, to reconstruct ourselves to bridge to each other.

The oracle awaits.
