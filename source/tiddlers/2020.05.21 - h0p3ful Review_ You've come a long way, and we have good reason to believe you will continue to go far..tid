** In time, I think you will come to appreciate your hard work in [[Antipleonasm Analysis]] and [[Prompted Introspection]]. That kind of reasoning and practice expressing yourself is crucial. It's a process of digesting small chunks that you can consistently improve upon. I know you aren't as pleased with them right now as you'd like, but I'm feeling [[hope]]ful that you'll grow with it (and even grow to like it). You've come a long way, and we have good reason to believe you will continue to go far.

*** I'm glad you are taking an interest in social conventions here. It's not always easy.
** Tell me about the old bicyclist.
** Overall, you didn't say a ton. You have a minor outline of the day. Try to fill it out with something.
*[[2020.05.20 – Antipleonasm Analysis: Well, ignore that.]]
** I'd like to see you attempt multiple lines of interpretation.
*** It's one of the weapons in the philosopher's arsenal. Show the branches, and then proof by cases.
**** And, when you are lucky, you will see that some interpretations shine far more brightly than others, and you'll be glad you took the time to inspect the [[gem]] from multiple angles.

** "PRCRPR (Per-Ker-Per), or PRCOPR (Per-Copp-er)" is striking to me. It reminds me of [[kicks]] with [[ridtyawtr]]. Further, [[chameleon]] and I have agreed that [[irwartfrr]] might best be pronounced "i-wart-fart."
