title: 2021.08.10 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: 'Mire Muh Bulge, It's Not A Wallet

[[TTTOTW]]. Attempted sleep by 12:45.

Woke at 5. Ruminating. Meditation. Thunder. [[TTTOTW]]. 

Spent the morning with her. She hates her deo (so don't wear it?), gets on her vestshirt[[thingamabob]]. I caused a massive panic in this woman by having tamped down the lid (not the plunging rod, just the lid :P) on her fancy 1-cup french press, and my scientist^^tm^^ argued that I've compactified the dust, and it will taste worse now, watered down even. Her new cream cheese is surprisingly close to the mark (though, though, though she doesn't allow her bagel to cool...and, obviously this invalidates her previous argument). A may realize she a bit craycray, cool. I have my plans for tonight.

Hugs'n'bugs. It is agreed that my daughter will never admit to having a good time with me. That would be blasphemy of some kind. As long as we get to be together, I can deal with that. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! Cleaning. Sleep by 10? 

Woke at 2. Meditation. [[TTTOTW]]. [[Morning Routine]]. Prep for dinner.

//The Walk// with my offspring. Went back to switch out their flipflops. My daughter did her work, and she had something to argue about. They argued quite a bit, and I only added condescending ignition points until we had to weave it altogether in our rabbithole. //Foundation// reference in the comparison between Mallow and Columbus instantly understood by my son. Boomshakalaka! My daughter had a question about written history "speeding" up, discussion of entropy, rate of change, and information in our systems over the evolution of our species. They launched into an argument about language, like the losers^^tm^^ they are (I might have joined them because I can't help myself; I'm extrinsically motivated [also, daughter brought up another person's definition of this earlier, and that was one of the pre-discussion discussions]). My son watched Youtube [[vidya]]s of people playing horror games. We had an excellent discussion of parasocial relationships, [[memetic warfare]], the concept of celebrity, representation, principal-agent problems, skin in the game, [[The Other]], and the necessity of vulnerability for [[intimacy]]. Ran into a couple walking that said they had seen us many times. I didn't know the street name they picked out, but they mapped it out for us. My daughter was angry for me hugging her because she tried to tear my worry beads out of my hand (a continued discussion of our moral and political rights - a demonstration of what it means to build our boundaries together). Vapelyfe.

//Foundation// @ 7:26:29. Footbath. [[5c0ut]] joined us for a bit. [[TTTOTW]].

Went upstairs and talked with broski. He made a cake that a co-worker felt he shouldn't have because it wasn't precisely by the books (though it sold fast). He's been curlin' up. Sometimes my job is to burst bubbles, gently as I know how; I am a wrestler. The climb looks steep to him. He's been stable before, but feels like there's not a serious chance he'll get higher than that plateau. My comfort is rarely one of "it will be okay" at some level, but I obviously think the odds are higher than he does. Plasticity mindset, rabbitholed pretty hard in a short time period. [[Humor]] helped make good tears by the end.

//Skintime//. She walked me through her day. It was busy AF, but it was good. Cheerful. I've officially taken back the claim that there are no bad picks in her bunch, though they are the exception. A hilarious moment with A and SL concerning buying a mead brewer's pipe bursting (someone heard "meat" instead), and she exclaimed in her usual giddy way (without fully realizing what she said, and I take complete credit for corrupting her subconscious): "I love meat pipes." Yeah, you do, girl. :P.<<ref "i">> Of course, these people didn't even flinch (how deeply unfortunate). //Inform the Men!// No time for meditation, food was almost done. Shower of the gods! [[TTTOTW]].

[[Family Gathering]]. My offspring made sketti with a perfect red sauce (peppers, shrooms, onions, beef, seasoning), and I think my daughter added olive oil and something else to the noodles. I had two bowls. We watched //China, IL// with glee until my wife came down from her shower. //Arrested Development//. By the end, I did what is becoming my usual. I curled up with [[Mitch the Bitch]] spooning me, put on my sleeping mask, and listened.

Sleep by 9?
