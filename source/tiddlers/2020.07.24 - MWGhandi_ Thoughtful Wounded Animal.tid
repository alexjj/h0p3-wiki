"""
How has your week been?
Jul 24 3:57pm
They are actually the only people I’ve worked for that have treated me well Other than [[k0sh3k]]
Jul 24 4:02pm
They treat me like family
Jul 24 4:03pm
Good. I am relieved.
Jul 24 4:03pm
LOL they’re just kind of intense and funny plus the capacity for the misunderstanding is high because of the lack of sleep and the misunderstandings within their own cultures
Jul 24 4:03pm
Taking care of a little one is a lot of work, but it's also precious.
Jul 24 4:04pm
I hope that the apartment is all this buildup to be because it’s the only one I found thus far it’s kind of hard to look for an apartment when you have no money
Jul 24 4:04pm
Ah, yeah, that sounds like some water to navigate.
Jul 24 4:04pm
I think the only job I’ve ever truly enjoyed is being a nanny because it’s very freeing because once I leave they rarely try to get a hold of me unless something drastic happens
Jul 24 4:04pm
I’m also trying to go easy on the relationship as much as I like the guy because he is cool but he’s very complex as you and I probably already know because of all the intellect rambling around in his head and because he’s from India and 28
Jul 24 4:05pm
We have all day date on Saturday and I’m so fucking nervous because I want it to go well and I made him plan it
Jul 24 4:06pm
That is amazing
Jul 24 4:06pm
That’s the kid

Jul 24 4:06pm
You have this insanely action packed week, lol
Jul 24 4:07pm
I'm glad that you are so constructive even in a hard place.
Jul 24 4:08pm
Job, date, housing...I think I would felt extremely happy/proud to have accomplished even a single one of those.
Jul 24 4:08pm
I’m really trying to be a voice of reason while simultaneously learning about the person and setting a very clear concise realistic linear boundaries but it is very hard when he is incredibly attractive and very well educated and honestly he just speaks his mind which is sometimes overwhelming plus he’s been to52 countries and he’s written motorcycles across the globe actually from UK to Mongolia then from Chile to Columbia and then if that’s not cool enough from South Africa to Ethiopia I honestly haven’t met anybody that has traveled more than me or been to places where I have been and come back inside of it as a holistic experience so as much as I’m fascinated with him he very much frustrates me because he’s going on a date with me and then he has it were not like exclusive quite yet which I’m not sure how I feel about so I can’t really except advice because I’m just trying to sort out what I think and last night I woke up at midnight and wrote out every single detail about him and then about what my expectations are
Jul 24 4:09pm
LOL well I went on one date with him and I went home and I was really fascinated by him as a person so I just decided to apply to jobs somewhat near him in because I learned really well with [[REDACTED]] that we don’t apply to jobs when we live in a place we apply to jobs some to ensure they were even worth that area and I applied to the job in the very following next day I was interviewing at the People’s house and then that same day or around about I was on a date with him again
Jul 24 4:10pm
Honestly I’ve always loved Asheville North Carolina I just never felt very led to live here so if this phase of my life I live in Asheville and I look at graduate programs then that’s fine I actually sat down last night and wrote down five graduate programs that I’m interested in and then at the bottom I wrote down all of my dream jobs which include president so YOLO
Jul 24 4:11pm
It's borderline a magical serendipity story to me, lol. That's awesome. You run with the opportunities in front of you.
Jul 24 4:11pm
I believe my next tattoo needs to be life happens as you’re planning
Jul 24 4:11pm
I love that you’re excited for me because my parents have been really negative about the whole situation which is really why I need to get out of their house as much as I love them they literally irritate the fuck out of me
Jul 24 4:11pm
I hope [[k0sh3k]] isn’t frustrated at me I called her and I may have an interrupted her work the other day so if you could apologize for me
Jul 24 4:12pm
I am sorry to hear that. I do not understand. I would not do nearly as well in your shoes as you have.
Jul 24 4:12pm
And maybe give her an update
Jul 24 4:12pm
Yeah I pretty much have to not talk to them because it’s really petty
Jul 24 4:12pm
Of course. I have her read and we talk. She's not frustrated with you at all. She is feeling stressed, but I'm pretty sure most people are, lol.
Jul 24 4:13pm
Which isn’t really fair to me because I was excited about Rakesh and I didn’t really wanna talk about it because they kind bash immigrants ha
Jul 24 4:13pm
ugh
Jul 24 4:13pm
I definitely understand that and that’s what I really heard in her voice
Jul 24 4:13pm
I love you. I have a hard time loving your parents.
Jul 24 4:13pm
I am so nervous for this date tomorrow I forgot to mention I’m taking my dog with me
Jul 24 4:13pm
I love my parents but at this point I don’t respect them because I show the things that are happening and it’s like oh well that could be not really happening that could be fake news but it’s Trevor Noah showing a video clip of what’s actually happening and I’m like how could that be fake news is reporting what is happening is Job is not even a report the news
Jul 24 4:14pm
`/throws-hands-in-the-air`
Jul 24 4:14pm
I also found out that I may or may not be working on Monday and Tuesday but it kind of came by surprise so I’m really hoping and crossing all my fingers and toes that I have work those days
Jul 24 4:15pm
I mean I could use two days off I just wonder if they’ll pay for it
Jul 24 4:15pm
We haven’t really talked about a contract LOL
Jul 24 4:15pm
I’m not allowed to throw my hands up in the air because I’m going to combat racism and anarchy anywhere I see it so you better be glad I’m not in Portland Oregon
Jul 24 4:15pm
I think I’m nervous because I’m genuinely fascinated by him the guy I’m going on a date with him because he keeps up with me on an intellectual level which no one has ever been able to do

Jul 24 4:16pm
Well, I hope you have a good time. I can imagine being nervous about the second date. I hope he makes you feel at ease.
Jul 24 4:17pm
That’s what it looks like and maybe possibly why I’m intimidated a tad he even said I am more intelligent than him which kind of it was a cool experience
Jul 24 4:17pm
I’m actually reading his thesis
Jul 24 4:17pm
It’s actually the 5th date
Jul 24 4:18pm
Oh*
Jul 24 4:18pm
Except he doesn’t speak Hindi so I have to learn a brand new language if I want to communicate on an Indian level
Jul 24 4:18pm
I think before I get married again well really divorced and then potentially married again I’m gonna have whoever wants to marry me come meet you and [[k0sh3k]] interrogation style
Jul 24 4:19pm
Because meeting my parents is kind of a joke to me personally
Jul 24 4:19pm
That is devotion. Most of the people I know have not read their spouses graduate or post-graduate work. I think that's a good sign.
Jul 24 4:19pm
Like I’m more intense than my parents
Jul 24 4:19pm
I bet he thinks so too
Jul 24 4:20pm
It’s 106 pages but I want to go see it in the binding and MIT
Jul 24 4:20pm
&
Jul 24 4:20pm
@
Jul 24 4:20pm
I think it would be more fun because I don’t think he has
Jul 24 4:20pm
I almost am jealous that he has 2° which is probably weird thing to say
Jul 24 4:20pm
It’s such a luxury
Jul 24 4:21pm
Yes. It's a privilege to be able to go to grad school for that long.
Jul 24 4:23pm
It only took him 3 years
Jul 24 4:24pm
So here’s the real question how smart do you have to be to do two masters degrees at the same time from MIT and then once you finish MIT you’re working and then you go and take online courses at Harvard public policy school
Jul 24 4:25pm
I just wanna know if I’m gonna have a mighty google executive babies
Jul 24 4:25pm
Lol.
Jul 24 4:25pm
LOL
Jul 24 4:25pm
I mean he’s attractive right
Jul 24 4:25pm
Yeah. He's hot. Would make extra cute and smart babies most likely, lol.
Jul 24 4:26pm
I think he’s more attractive because he has zero knowledge that he’s attractive and OK I’m glad to know that hopefully it’s because of my IQ and not just his
Jul 24 4:26pm
Hilariously I think it’s kind of funny how much he thinks we’re going to eat on Saturday I feel like he’s forgotten that I barely eat he said in the nicest way the other day that you know Emilee we really need to figure out how to make you feel healthy enough to eat and I thought that was such a nice way to say like baby need to eat instead of being like what the fuck why are you not eating
Jul 24 4:27pm
For me him and his profile being true is bizarre to me like who who goes across those places on a motorcycle like you have to read it to believe it
Jul 24 4:27pm
And then when you’re done with that here’s some light reading LOL that’s his thesis
Jul 24 4:28pm
Maybe you could read it and just give me the Cliff Notes version LOL
Jul 24 4:28pm
So I actually like logistic question is he only earns $90,000 as a consultant for a company that works with inside Toyota as a consultant so if he switched jobs would he actually potentially earn more
Jul 24 4:29pm
Looking through it now.
Jul 24 4:30pm
So what do we think?
Jul 24 6:53pm
I'd like to know his thoughts on capitalism.
Jul 24 8:27pm
Can you explain a way to get him to talk about that?
Jul 24 8:27pm
"What do you think about capitalism?" =D
Jul 24 8:28pm
In a thought provoking way
Jul 24 8:28pm
You can offer your own perspective and allow him to wrestle with that.
Jul 24 8:28pm
Lol 😆
Jul 24 8:28pm
That wouldn’t start a good talk ha
Jul 24 8:28pm
lol. I am autistic. I am not a good judge of how to make it palatable in many respects.
Jul 24 8:29pm
I ever tell you how I met my wife?
Jul 24 8:29pm
Haha I know. I probs should be more direct. However I think of all ways he could perceive what I ask and then go from there. Anyway I know he’s anti wealthy people, anti Tesla, pro choice and pro science and education obviously ha
Jul 24 8:30pm
No you didn’t
Jul 24 8:30pm
I could use something from the paper and then correlate it to capitalism
Jul 24 8:30pm
We are both people who studied philosophy and religion (I took the senior seminars, but I never actually went into the religion program at Berea). Our first class together was //Paul's Letters//. Lawd, that woman and I argued a lot in the middle of class. Same for all the other classes we had together (especially since we were the TAs of most of each other's classes). I had to walk with the woman to argue with her (if only she could see reason! :P). I don't know how to tell you how much I respect her, and I am lucky to know her opinion and feelings (which isn't to say I'm skilled at understanding her). Walking and talking is still the most important thing I get to do with her every day. I'm psychologically and physiologically dependent on her at this point. I shit you not: some of our arguments have lasted 16 years. Direct honesty is so very expensive. I've also made mistakes in my marriage, obviously. For example, one time, I screamed "fuck you" at her (and I can't take that back). My conversations with her like a sacrament (I'm a zealot, but religious people do not consider me religious usually).
Jul 24 8:40pm
Wow that’s incredible beautiful
Jul 24 8:42pm
Y’all should renew your vows at some point and this should be yours
Jul 24 8:42pm

Jul 24 8:42pm
Hey would it be okay if I explained that story at some point to Rakesh
Jul 24 8:42pm
Of course. Everything I say is yours to do with as you need.
Jul 24 8:43pm
Sometimes I believe he lets fear of random shit get in the way
Jul 24 8:43pm
Same with me unless it’s my story of abusive shit
Jul 24 8:43pm
Also how are the kiddos less lazy
Jul 24 8:43pm
It has been a shit week with them. =(.
Jul 24 8:44pm
Tbh [[j3d1h]]’s response reminded me of [[k0sh3k]] ya
Jul 24 8:44pm
Oh no
Jul 24 8:44pm
I’m sorry to hear that
Jul 24 8:44pm
Great when we get together for dinner and just talking, but school hasn't been not great.
Jul 24 8:44pm
Kids are amazing and terrible at the same time
Jul 24 8:44pm
Yeah, well, it seems to come in waves.
Jul 24 8:44pm
I agree. I'm also just wildly unqualified to be a father. It's a calling.
Jul 24 8:44pm
That’s why artists like Job Bellion exist
Jul 24 8:44pm
Absolutely not
Jul 24 8:45pm
There’s no way unqualified
Jul 24 8:45pm
Relearning how to breath has helped me tremendously
Jul 24 8:46pm
Yes. Spending time meditating and breathing does some kind of work. I cannot say I understand it well enough.
Jul 24 8:46pm
Lol 😂 no need to understand
Jul 24 8:46pm
haha, I'm a curious person about it
Jul 24 8:46pm
Maybe just instead of trying to force school take a you day
Jul 24 8:47pm
They will have a vacation day next week. It was going to be longer, but I feel they've already spent it.
Jul 24 8:47pm
I've been here before. I think there's a good chance they'll swing back around here.
Jul 24 8:48pm
Just takes time.
Jul 24 8:48pm
Like fine wine
Jul 24 8:48pm
=D
Jul 24 8:48pm
Or cheese it’s all relative
Jul 24 8:49pm
Says the woman dating the mechanical engineer
Jul 24 8:49pm
lol I still can’t believe he likes me so much
Jul 24 8:49pm
And loves riding motorcycles across crazy places
Jul 24 8:49pm
Like China ha
Jul 24 8:49pm
Also, I should let you know up front that I am a substance user. I use cannabis and alcohol. I've used mushrooms, LSD, ketamine, and some others.
Jul 24 8:50pm
The amount of traveling he's engaged in sounds very interesting.
Jul 24 8:51pm
Yeah that’s okay with me
Jul 24 8:51pm
Yeah it’s hard for me to talk to him about it though ha because he went on it while being on a motorcycle
Jul 24 8:52pm
It’s just not something I’ve ever imagined and he says that we shouldn’t build castles together in our minds and I was proud he said that and it’s stuck with me
Jul 24 8:53pm
No castle building means don’t build dreams until the reality is in front of you
Jul 24 8:54pm
That’s what is hard I’m a thinker ha so castle building expert ha
Jul 24 8:54pm
I totally appreciate that metaphor.
Jul 24 8:54pm
But it’s okay for him to push me out of my comfort zone as long as he understands I’m going to throw his out of the window one of these dats
Jul 24 8:55pm
*days
Jul 24 8:55pm
lmao
Jul 24 8:55pm
Honestly would love to write about him
Jul 24 8:55pm
And his adventures
Jul 24 8:55pm
I told him on our first few days chatting that I wanted to write his autobiography ha
Jul 24 8:56pm
Because hanging out with him he’s so chill and you’d never know how smart or cool he is
Jul 24 8:56pm
That seems like a lot to take in within 5 dates.
Jul 24 8:57pm
Lol
Jul 24 8:58pm
He’s the only person to say this after hearing about my current situation
Jul 24 8:58pm
Image attached to message
Image attached to message
We matched on bumble and texted once then he said
Jul 24 8:59pm
After we chatted he said that’s fucking terrible I’m sorry
Jul 24 9:00pm
Then said in the most humble way possible that he wants me to let go off my biases and assumptions about my past experiences
Jul 24 9:00pm
Aye. I am glad that he is taking the time to understand your pain. It would be a redflag if he didn't.
Jul 24 9:00pm
And give him a chance
Jul 24 9:01pm
Oh we’ve had plenty of convos about how he fully understanding how to listen in the beginning
Jul 24 9:01pm
Haha gray matter isn’t helpful with heart talks ha
Jul 24 9:01pm
Actually he’s cried in front of me 4 times
Jul 24 9:02pm
Which I’ve never seen a guy do
Jul 24 9:02pm
I’m not even sure I’ve seen my dad cry
Jul 24 9:02pm
Yeah, your dude needs to be able to cry in front of you. Super important what you can say to each other through tears as well.
Jul 24 9:02pm
Oh he doesn’t talk ha
Jul 24 9:03pm
Will get there
Jul 24 9:03pm
I’m nervous about tomorrow
Jul 24 9:03pm
Because he overthinks and I’m just apparently hard to talk to when I’m being so pretty
Jul 24 9:03pm
Ha
Jul 24 9:03pm
Slow down and enjoy it. It's a gift.
Jul 24 9:03pm
Little does he know that I’m only going to make him talk about serious stuff ha
Jul 24 9:04pm
haha
Jul 24 9:04pm
And I definitely am
Jul 24 9:04pm
Well, good. That has to happen too.
Jul 24 9:04pm
Just wish he’d let me take pictures
Jul 24 9:04pm
I just don’t understand why he can’t talk to me face-to-face about hard stuff he said it’s because I’m pretty but I think that’s a cop out
Jul 24 9:04pm
That is an odd phrase.
Jul 24 9:05pm
I don’t make it easy haha
Jul 24 9:05pm
I know ha
Jul 24 9:05pm
Maybe I intentionally don’t make it easy
Jul 24 9:05pm
Image attached to message
I downloaded this app in hopes that we could use it
Jul 24 9:05pm
I know I’m not an expert at talking or listening but I know he could be better
Jul 24 9:06pm
I am surprised to see you dating. I would normally not have recommended that to anyone in your shoes, but I also feel that you have been so constructive. You take risks, and so far, I'm unable to speak about how you throw the dice. I admire how you aren't half-assing your life. I aim to be supportive.
Jul 24 9:07pm
Image attached to message
This is what he’s reading and I’m so fascinated by the book tbh
Jul 24 9:07pm
That is a classic.
Jul 24 9:08pm
Worth your time too.
Jul 24 9:08pm
I understand where you are coming from when it comes to me however I have parents who are saying don’t post stuff online you know your still married still.
Jul 24 9:08pm
So it was also said by them that I shouldn’t date until I’m divorced
Jul 24 9:08pm
So for me it’s more like finding me after months of being alone with a pup
Jul 24 9:09pm
I take my time to formulate thoughts
Jul 24 9:09pm
I hear that. I also do not respect what I believe is the optical reason they've provided.
Jul 24 9:09pm
And risk map prior to even being in the space
Jul 24 9:09pm
I actually wouldn’t get in the car the other day or give him the keys back because of not feeling okay
Jul 24 9:10pm
So I took the keys and stood in front of the car
Jul 24 9:10pm
Damn it I don’t even get where they have the capacity to decide for me
Jul 24 9:11pm
I told them they can’t give me advice
Jul 24 9:11pm
Until they have a healthy marriage
Jul 24 9:12pm
Same reason you can’t throw rocks while living in a glass house
Jul 24 9:12pm
[[h0p3]] you and [[k0sh3k]] can give me sound advice because you have thought out reasonable words
Jul 24 9:13pm
If I elope I’ll maybe let you FaceTime interrogate ya
Jul 24 9:15pm
You have so much on your plate. I hope you are finding time to rest. You've got a delightful manic energy that you channel, and I hope you are not being too hard on yourself, keeping lower expectations, and make space for healing. I think of you as a wounded animal who is gracefully handling multiple crises.
Jul 24 9:16pm
Oh, [[k0sh3k]] and I eloped too, btw
Jul 24 9:16pm
I never even met her parents, and [[k0sh3k]] met my donors once (I do not speak to mine).
Jul 24 9:16pm
I very strongly appreciate what it means not to respect one's creators very much.
Jul 24 9:16pm
My wiki, in fact, began a non-linear letter to them. It's part of how I've had to deal with the breaking apart of our relationship. It's been cataclysmic.
Jul 24 9:17pm
Hahaha 😂
Jul 24 9:18pm
I’m not a wounded animal
Jul 24 9:18pm
I’m a survivor
Jul 24 9:18pm
And I am making space for that
Jul 24 9:18pm
I agree you are obviously a survivor.
Jul 24 9:18pm
Haha
Jul 24 9:18pm
Shit. =/
Jul 24 9:19pm
Plenty of therapy later
Jul 24 9:19pm
[[k0sh3k]] was too at 19.
Jul 24 9:19pm
All throughout seasons of my life
Jul 24 9:19pm
Yeah she told me her story
Jul 24 9:19pm
My parents don’t even know
Jul 24 9:19pm
I chose selectively who I tell
Jul 24 9:19pm
I say that to say I am good at coping with loss
Jul 24 9:20pm
Yes, ma'am. i agree.
Jul 24 9:20pm
I take each day and date a hour at a time
Jul 24 9:20pm
And if I feel like tomorrow is too much I’ll tell him
Jul 24 9:20pm
Straight up
Jul 24 9:20pm
I am no longer impulsive or okay with much madness
Jul 24 9:20pm
But sleep is still something I’m retraining
Jul 24 9:21pm
I can't say I've solved the sleep monster myself, so I have no room to talk there.

Jul 24 9:21pm
These are my standing non negotiable ones for a relationship
Jul 24 9:22pm
Feel free to hold me accountable to them
Jul 24 9:22pm
I can say that sleep is good but is weird for me
Jul 24 9:22pm
I didn’t sleep much in college nor in Chicago as a nanny
Jul 24 9:22pm
Like falling asleep near someone is kinda jarring now ha
Jul 24 9:23pm
Rakesh even asked if he needed to sleep downstairs which I really appreciated
Jul 24 9:23pm
Because the [[REDACTED]]
Jul 24 9:23pm
I think these are rationale needs
Jul 24 9:24pm
As I said, I'm surprised. I do not doubt that you have put enormous thought and energy into it. I think you are being exceptionally rational given what you have here (was talking about that on my walk today). I remain optimistic for you, but I still feel worried and I feel pain from here even though I don't know what it's like to be in your shoes here.
Jul 24 9:25pm
See where I feel that I fail is being extremely vulnerable because of those feelings of self doubt that I’m not going to let take control
Jul 24 9:25pm
Hmm 🤔
Jul 24 9:26pm
[[REDACTED]] will always be a terrible part of my life but an amazing part as well so for that it isn’t pain for me but growth
Jul 24 9:26pm
I still have to muster up enough courage to write a bomb ass impact statement for [[REDACTED]]'s sentencing however I want to also remain present
Jul 24 9:27pm
I try to keep everything in check however if I wanna cry I cry
Jul 24 9:27pm
I'm unqualified to say anything on that front. I am happy to hear that you are surviving toward thriving. I'm here to guard your vulnerability and watch your back. I'm glad you cry.
Jul 24 9:28pm
Thanks so much
Jul 24 9:28pm
For that willingness
Jul 24 9:28pm
I’m still a tad jumpy haha 😆 thankfully my employers house is like a California home
