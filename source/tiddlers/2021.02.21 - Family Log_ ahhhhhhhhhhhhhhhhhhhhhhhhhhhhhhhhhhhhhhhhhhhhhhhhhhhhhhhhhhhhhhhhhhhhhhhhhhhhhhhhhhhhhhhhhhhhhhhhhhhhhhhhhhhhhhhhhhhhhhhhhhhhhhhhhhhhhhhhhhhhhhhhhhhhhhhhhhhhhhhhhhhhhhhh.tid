title: 2021.02.21 - Family Log: ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

!! Write a paragraph summarizing each person's week:

* [[1uxb0x]]
** 1uxb0x
*** Monday was my favorite day this week, saturday would be my second favorite. The reason I liked monday was because I got to read a good book. And saturday I slept. A lot. I liked fixing the sink, that was a cool hack.
** j3d1h
*** I really liked your Language Arts work! You're getting pretty good at summarizing, I'd say, and you should keep on improving. It's been very fun going over characters and worlds with you. You've got a lot of potential for that form of writing, too! I'm glad we had more time to talk, and hopefully walks will only add to that.
** k0sh3k
*** For @1uxb0x: You did some good school work this week - I am especially happy with your work on your handwriting, and can already see improvement - but I do wish you'd gotten your wiki completely done. I hope this next week goes even better! You did some manual labor this week, too - I appreciate your work outside after the snows and with fixing the kitchen pipe. I am glad you finished Blood at the Root, and glad you liked it; I hope you enjoy How to Read Literature Like a Professor for Kids, too, as well as the books that you read along with it. I'm glad you got some playtime in this week - both online and at the table. I'm also glad we worked on doing your hair this week, and I hope we can keep working on it until it looks amazing.
** h0p3
*** [[1uxb0x]] has played more [[MTG]] than the previous week. He shoveled plenty of snow, navigated to Home Depot, picked out parts, and fixed the kitchen sink. He's done a better job at memorizin crucial information this week. He should consider knocking before entering more. His schoolwork obtains, but the proof does not. He played TF2 on his 2-in-1 (so, maybe the Xbone and Desktop should just be plugged back in?). He needs a passion, a functioning personal infrastructure, a completed wiki, and his mother's school work finished.
** AIR
*** @1uxb0x: We didn't have much interaction this week.  I enjoyed playing MTG and CAH with you, I always appreciate the willingness to help me get better at my deck. I'ts so cool that you fixed the sink! I hope you find something to pour yourself into. you have been so helpful with helping keep the kitchen cleaner and more organized. I liked that you enjoyed that quesadilla I made for you. thank you for being willing to try new foods. \

* [[j3d1h]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I enjoyed talking to you about characters. We've not gotten to talk to each other that much on walks because we haven't been having any. I've not seen you as unhappy this week, but maybe I just don't remember. I enjoyed playing cards against humanity.
** j3d1h
*** My week was pretty decent, though more stressful than I would have liked. I'm officially planning to leave the servers that piss me off most. As preparation, I'm friending all the good ones and inviting them to my own servers. I haven't done a ton in the way of drawing, but I am happy with Melody's design so far. I've been thinking about how to use my underappreciated characters a little more - maybe I should write for them, huh?
** k0sh3k
*** For @j3d1h: I'm glad you've finished Gilgamesh finally! I hope the rest of the books go faster. You've been thinking about this paper for a while now; you should just get it out and not worry too much about it. I really like your steampunk pirate world idea; I hope you and your friends have fun putting it together. I had fun playing CaH with you and confirming you are the worst of us all. And if I neglected to mention it last week, thank you for sending me the information and image about St. Valentine being the patron saint of beekeepers and the plague - that was super cool
** h0p3
*** [[j3d1h]]'s been modding Discord servers, and this has been, of course (excepting that art server), an amazing use of her time; however, she's been eliminating unjustified toxicity from her life (e.g. Z). She revealed more of her art to me this week, and her progress continues. She worked some on her machines, did her chores, shoveled snow, cared more about her appearance (it's a good thing she doesn't take after her father), and got some time in with her buds (she received an honest and high compliment from [[j3d1h: Entity]]. She's a dirty rotten cheater in //Cards Against Humanity//.
** AIR
*** @j3d1h. You seemed to have an good week. I liked that you would come and talk with me while I cooked, I liked hearing about your villain and how you have come up with their personality and traits and their redeemable-ness. It's fun to talk with you. I hope to make cookies with you soon. thank you for shoveling the snow.

* [[k0sh3k]]
** 1uxb0x
*** Thank you for letting me read blood at the root, I've enjoyed the book. Thank you for choosing out books you think would be good for me. It's neat that Valentine was the patron saint of bee's and plagues. I remember you coming home early on Monday, yeah, that seems like a good reason.
** j3d1h
*** Plague doctor x beekeeper is //far// superior to Cupid. I'm very sad that some people would fail at NotSportsBall. Unpaywall is sweet, so I'm wondering what that model move would look like! Perhaps vampires regenerate when you try to kill them a different way? Also, I'm glad you're helping 1uxb0x out with his hair, it looks fantastic now.
** k0sh3k
*** For myself (k0sh3k): I really did not feel well this week; the migraine was a bad one, and I just felt off and ill the rest of the week. I also came home early and/or missed work on-site entirely and worked from home quite a bit. The conference was informational, and I'm glad my management class is mostly done (mostly). I'm glad I got to do ashes this year, although it's just not the same as church and I really miss going to services. I watched a lot of Grimm this week, too. I had some mild panic attacks about the checking account and the kitchen sink.
** h0p3
*** [[k0sh3k]] had a cold sore, she's feeling nauseous, she's been blue (snow weather takes a toll on her), //bleargh//, she's stressed about: that terrible management class, traveling in bad weather, her offspring's choices, money, her hair, and the insanity of the world. Her migraine sucked (though her sleep was reasonable enough), and she needed extra space this week (though was quite generous regardless). She took more notes than usual this week (I've stumbled across her writing them many times this week). She marked everyone with an ash cross. She's needed to vegg out on //Grimm// and The Youtubes. She cut her own hair, and it suits her. My guess is that things will start to slow down again in April.
** AIR
*** @k0sh3k: I tried not to bother you this week, I could tell you were not feeling well. you had a lot of meetings this week. I am glad you were able to watch your shows. I loved the laughing moment we had when playing CAH, at aome point the laughter was no longer about the joke but that were laughing at each others laughter ( these are always gold moments for me and glad we got to share that).

* [[h0p3]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I enjoyed fixing the sink with you. I appreciate that you try to find problems in our house and fix them. Thank you for the memes. You missed a carpe diem/tempus segmentum? wow.  Gnomadic Chomskyanisms is pretty cool.
** j3d1h
*** I am liking your paragraph form CTS-es. I am not, however, enjoying your schizo-posting. It makes no sense, and when it does, I wish it didn't. I know I'm bad at MTG, but at least I'm trying to be more aggressive! Your maymays are gold, as always. You aren't the manager of anything, sir.
** k0sh3k
*** For @h0p3: Thank you for figuring out what was wrong with the kitchen sink, getting the parts, and teaching the boy how to fix it. You also worked hard again this week to help me feel better, like giving me more space than you normally like and making me a burger and fries. Thank you for talking me down when I'm panicking. It sounds like you had another highly communicative week for someone curling up.
** h0p3
*** [[h0p3]] seems to be back on an [[FTO]] horse of some kind. It was a good week, my dudes. It was productive, well-read, well-slept, well-sexed, well-"et", and he's feeling happy. The basement looks saner, problems in the house are being addressed, the limited time he was allowed to have with his offspring went well, and he's been bouncing around between folks a lot. He was a decent helper, and he'll get better at it. Partially scathing letters have been expensive.
** AIR
*** @h0p3: your sleep schedule be wak bruh. lol glad you were able to have the 4 hour conversation! I like getting to spend time with you, thank you for taking the time to answer my question. fuck Captain Obvious, tear him apart. you have been writing to people a lot. I appreciate being able to join you on your exercise routine. I like paying MTG with you and helping me get better at Dredge ( you are patient with me and I am grateful for that, thank you for having me go step by step and calling each action I take out, and to think about why I am doing each play), I liked playing CAH with you. you were very kind to drive me up to look at cars, I enjoyed hearing about what you were looking for in a F2F.

* [[AIR]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I'm happy that you have a journal. You didn't write a lot on the 19'th. I liked your enchiladas (I think that's the name?) It sucks when someone lies to you about something so important like a car (at least, in the USA, it's important, Europe is much better at this.)
** j3d1h
*** Thanks for making breakfast for us a few days, and dinner most of them. I'm glad you took a break from talking to salesmen. Capitalism is exhausting at times, and you need some time off. CAH with you was very fun - even if you don't think you had good cards, a lot of your combinations were hilarious.
** k0sh3k
*** For @AIR: You cooked a lot of good food again this week. Thank you especially for making pancakes by special request for Mardi Gras for me! I had a //lot// of fun talking (and laughing) with you again this week, too. I'm sorry you didn't find a car yet; I know having a car makes life a lot easier, and I hope you find the right one soon. I'm glad you applied for the YUL position - I hope you get it! Then we can both be ultra-elite asshats.
** h0p3
*** [[AIR]] sifted through scammers (an expensive task) looking for a vehicle, cooked up a storm (the Indian meal was intense, the pickles were dope), got in plenty vapelyfe time with his broski, chilled and slept, started destroying everyone with Dredge, continued to integrate as a roommate, did his hair and exercized (dieted too), talked with friends, worked on where to spend money in the kitchen, fleshed out a [[CTS]] log each day, and has been planning life. This week was a break for him, and I'm glad. It did some good.
** AIR
*** @AIR: it was a week started out shitty, but it got better. had a great time making food for the family. legit just slowed down this week and did what I wanted to do (which was nothing lol). I reorganized my recipes, started running and exercising this week. played some games with the family! started working on the list for the kitchen and to work on getting 6 months supply for food.
