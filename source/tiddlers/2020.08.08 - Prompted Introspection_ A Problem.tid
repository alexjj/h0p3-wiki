title: 2020.08.08 - Prompted Introspection: A Problem

!! Who do you talk to when you have a problem?

It depends on the context, of course. I try to talk to myself, and given the nature of the wiki, I'm also talking to everyone to some [[dok]]. When it comes to individuals, my wife is the first person I tend to speak with. My problems are her problems, and vice versa. I try to include her, even passively and just for information, on everything. Some problems aren't big, and plenty of problems aren't hers to deal with. I'm still glad I have her to listen though. 

I think I'm not such a great listener, but not for a lack of trying. First, I just don't understand people as well as they can understand me (which is not to say we understand each other or even ourselves all that well). Second, it's not that I can't be an active listener, but to do so, I become too immersive, too close, tear everything apart, engage in the engineer's disease, and I cost too much to speak with for some. The best I can do is stand there sometimes. Perhaps I should move away from being a sounding board (wrestling is expensive) and simply be a vent-sponge. I'm aiming to be quieter, especially because all threads lead to the same place for me. Few will recognize that well enough.
