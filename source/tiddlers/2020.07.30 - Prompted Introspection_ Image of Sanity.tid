title: 2020.07.30 - Prompted Introspection: Image of Sanity

!! Who is one of your favorite heroes of fiction?

[[2019.09.17 - Prompted Introspection: RoboJesus]] picks out a character that I wish belonged in [[Identifying With: Fictional Characters]]. Asimov clearly loved his character too. I'm poking a hole in the superlative because this question is one I should try to answer throughout life.

Huey Freeman of //The Boondocks// is a fictional hero I hold in high regard. God damn terrorist, itellyawat! Lol. He is a legend to me, I tell you. To some non-trivial [[dok]], up there with [[Saint Plato]] himself, I aim to mold my offspring in virtue of Huey.<<ref "w">> There are plenty of characteristics I admire about many cartoon characters I've encountered, but he is actually correct about what matters in reality so often. He's like the anti-Batman. He attac, he protec, he resilient, he [[h0p3punk]] done [[right]] in how [[hope]]ful he is even when predicting failure, and he is honorable in his ability to say "I think you are more evil than you believe or feel" like a martial marshal toward fittingly collective spheres of eudaimonia. I think he's like a personal hero to me in allowing me to accept my insanity too. He's gotta be one of the sanest images I've ever seen in my life. I [[hope]]-2 earn his {{Text Art: 𝕱𝕴𝕽𝕰🔥}}badge.

If I were ever to be a rapper, I would rap in Biblicism. How vulgar!? My god I have searched that space.
