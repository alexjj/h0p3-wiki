title: 2020.12.27 - Prompted Introspection: Coomer

!! If you had to choose one, would you rather double or halve your sex drive?

Fuck it: double!<<ref "s">> Turn that shit up to 11! ^^live dangerously!<<ref "h">>^^ Lmao. I would aim for 6 a day;<<ref "l">> I'd call that a habit or maybe even pathological. I [[like]] the idea of desiring even moar lust. There's a [[hope]] in lust that I still need.

It's not that I haven't considered lowering my libido. Maybe I would be more productive, less annoying or disgusting, more easy going, I have no idea. It could be frustrating, and maybe I don't need more frustration. Think of all the extra buckets though?<<ref "c">>

I suppose I could test one direction, though I'm not sure how best to do that. I have to say: when I'm not interested in getting off for a long period of time (for more than a day), it's a bad sign. It's almost like missing sleep or a meal. But, that is not the same.
