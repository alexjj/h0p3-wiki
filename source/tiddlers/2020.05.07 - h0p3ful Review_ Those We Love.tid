//Where is the [[review]]?//

*[[Updraft and Redraw]]
** I hope you'll have so many independent projects that you will have other kinds of tags to use instead. Add one more to this one, eh?
*** Thank you for tagging, btw.
*[[The Lightning Thief: 9, notes]]
** I like that you aren't afraid to make jokes in your notes. Get it out onto the page. 
** You've got these landmarks set up in your nesting too. I like it.
*[[2020.05.06 – TDL: DCS]]
** womp womp.
** Make sure what your mother writes on the board gets in here. I'm tired of asking.
*[[2020.05.06 – Prompted Introspection: Telly]]
** You need to flesh this argument out. You have too many gaps here. Sometimes, you'll need to ask yourself if there are more chains of thought you need to add between any two consecutive claims (and, they can branch so much than you can't make it linear too, in some cases).
*[[2020.05.06 – Carpe Diem]]
** Well, why not?
** Okay, I'm trying to get you to bed earlier. The [[vidyas]] are so delightful!
*** Oooooo. =)
**** I know I've done a good job when you sigh. Can you `/sigh` louder?
*[[2020.05.06 – Antipleonasm Analysis: Relation]]
** Yeah, I guess I would. Lol.
** It sucks thinking about the fact that some day we won't be with the people we love more than anything. 
*** It's crucial to remember it, to not take for granted, to enjoy what you've got. This is one of the reasons I take [[CTS]] so seriously. 
**** I don't think I could make it without your mom, btw. 
***** I'm glad you agree. It's the truth.
* [[Yearly Cross-section]]
** Where'd you dig up those claims in [[2018.05.07 -- Math]]? I like 'em.
** I'm grateful to see you moving from smaller fragments to larger ones.
