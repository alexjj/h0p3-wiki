title: 2020.07.28 - Prompted Introspection: Self-Construing Disposition

!! What is one of your most marked characteristics?

[[2019.09.12 - Prompted Introspection: Marked Characteristic]] is correct, and, yes, I still aim to be ironic and thorough in trying to answer a variations of the original question (hence the modification). I'm not going to be able to resolve the problems embedded in the question to my satisfaction. 

My self-construal is skin-in-the-game expensive, negational, paranoic, deviant, and generally something most people distance themselves from in the end. I am far more likely than my cohort to perceive, believe, and desire realism, essence, selfhood, and metaphysics. I'm hypertelic. I take the problem of the relationship between individualism and collectivism extremely seriously, and I continue to learn what it means to interact with and position myself in relation to [[The Other]], [[WINTCIS]]. I'm a verifiable anomaly, and it's inevitably a lonely journey in some respects (and, of course, to some extent, that's true for everyone).
