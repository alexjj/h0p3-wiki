title: 2021.05.11 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Dance

Woke at 6:30 to her noises. She so noisy. Hugs'n'bugs, following her around like her pet dog, as is my ~~duty~~ privilege. She's in a good mood. Way too much to do today, and I'm hoping I'm on the docket (not betting on it). 

[[TTTOTW]]. Cleaning and organizing. Some prep for dinner. We should shoot for later since [[5c0ut]] won't get off until late. 

[[ASmith]] has been extra quiet, and I'm not the only one who thinks so (exceptionally quiet, even upon request from what I've passively seen). He does respond though. Can't see enough. Blind over here. I was able to get in touch with him, thankfully. He's alright.

Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

Fixed kitchen handle and my daughter's doorknob. This is the second time both have broke off. =/. 

[[TTTOTW]] + Dancing.<<ref "dor">>

More work outside. Lawn is better. Tons of laundry. Also, added anti-vibration padding to the machines. Not convinced there's a difference. Set up the KVM. Put n52 away (maybe later, eh?). 

Exploring [[Dread]] for realsies. I should probably flesh out my [[Links: Tor Hidden Services]] list. 

Inform the Men! Holy fuck. Thank the maker. Meditation. Shower of the gods! Thinking about everything she has to do. It's absurd. I found a pube almost 4 inches long, longer than my [[micropenis]]. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Got to hug my bro a bunch. I've not seen much of him. They haven't built his schedule appropriately yet (and he's generously giving them the time to do as they agreed before hiring). Broski wanted to try a benzo again since the first didn't touch him. 400ug Flubromazolam. On a whim, we went searching for gravity bongs. Grabbed a bukket.<<ref "b">> Gonna try Lady Salvia in a different manner. I just can't smoke.

Finished off dinner (though I should have started some of it earlier, it wasn't as tender as I'd like). [[Family Gathering]], late into the evening. Ribs, potato soup, green beans, water. My son was toast, and I think most people were exhausted. 

[[TTTOTW]] while bro vaped alongside me.

Fireman Time!
