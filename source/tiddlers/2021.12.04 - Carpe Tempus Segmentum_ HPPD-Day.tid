Read up on zlam with her, since this is one of the substitutes I have. Cute to see the .4ml splashed everywhere, including her eye, accidentally, for the allergy test. //Skintime// until I couldn't stay awake any longer (hit me like a truck). Maybe 2?

Woke at 8:45. Pushed Brix.<<ref "t">> Mi amor was singing and making herself something to eat. Hugs'n'bugs. [[TTTOTW]]. WCC G7.

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. Inform the Fail. =(. `/sigh`. We had a good time.

[[TTTOTW]] while mi amor played music for me. [[ASK]] seems to be feeling better. PKM [[Anon]] [[ping]]. [[5c0ut]] and [[ASK]] made the best chocolate, fudge cookie I've ever had, flavor and texture. Trippin' while surfing thousands of images. [[ASK]]'s joyful bouncing today. Also, sword fight was real (that makes sense of the excellent sounds). Both cats are down here too, sleeping soundly.

A says mi amor is the most self-deprecating person he's ever met and that she takes responsibility for everything. Greek teacher says there's no way she's not getting in, and that she's going to excel here (and, to my eyes, librarianship is not her greatest talent, despite how radically skilled she is). Her belly is hurting today. Just gonna chill, go no where, try to ease it (she's even skipping Greek: good). G may be the pick for the alt evaluator.

We're going to set aside part of the kitchen just for the real^^tm^^ chefs, `/scoff`. There are some tools that should only be touched by people who know how to respectfully use them. Bougie shit, ofc. Hummus + pita + olives + tea.

Put mi amor to bed. She's tired, and not feeling well. Bad enough she might not go to church tomorrow. 

Made food with [[ASK]]. Bagel (and noodles for her, ofc) + //Skintime// + //China, Il//. Uh oh, my belly doesn't feel good.
