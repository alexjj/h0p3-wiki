Hope all is well today ðŸ˜Š

Wed 3:39pm
We are doing well. Grinding away. Reading and writing like a fool. We may be moving again, trying to find a house (probably not going to happen). Rent is ridiculously expensive.
Wed 3:40pm
So far, everyone is still healthy. We make slow progress in school, but it's there.
Wed 3:41pm
My sleep has been erratic, watching the world burn and keeping me up at night.
Wed 3:41pm
Anyway, how are you? You feeling 100%? How are the boys?
Wed 3:41pm
Good luck In Your haunt for a house! I think I feel the same we will stay here til either 1) we go back to Denver 2) we find a house. Shit is definitely crazy I have purposely donâ€™t follow or watch the news cause I canâ€™t mentally take it. Boys are good me not so much I am healed from my hospital visit but Iâ€™m return I now have an allergy cold and am quarantine thankfully with pay! Today is Estebanâ€™s birthday so we are hanging out. Probably do a curbside pick somewhere for dinner tonight. I think he wants Outback.. not sure yet. Matthew is working again he just started a new job Monday for a warehouse position in JC. So honestly blessed and canâ€™t complain.
Wed 4:10pm
Oh man excuse my typos and grammar ðŸ™ˆ
Wed 4:10pm
Naw, don't worry. I always feel that way when I'm writing to English teachers. It's my honor to be able to speak with you.
Wed 4:11pm
Quarantine with pay is awesome! I hope you get some chill time in.
Wed 4:12pm
Birthday is a great reason to party. Hope the steak is dope.
Wed 4:13pm
How's Matthew liking the new job?
Wed 4:14pm
Sounds like life is holding together for ya.
Wed 4:14pm
Matthew says itâ€™s easy- so Iâ€™m hoping it stays that way! && yes I/we really cannot complain!
Wed 4:15pm
Iâ€™m glad you are all in good health as well
Wed 4:15pm
Are you guys going to buy or rent a house?
Wed 4:15pm
We are looking to buy, but it's just looking right now. I say the odds at between 5-20% that we can do it. Rent is $1800. That shit is no joke.
Wed 4:58pm
Oh I know thatâ€™s how it is in Denver as well thatâ€™s why we left but it will soon happen everywhere unfortunately because they are trying to divid people into two groups the rich and the poor
