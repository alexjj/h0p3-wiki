**** A big shoutout to Richard Muhfuckin Woosley, the leopard-thonged little dude in my 5-6th grade class (our classes were merged often, and that's fine, as most of us still didn't know our multiplication tables anyways<<ref "d">>) who could pee over 20 feet onto teacher's cars in elementary school! Talk about squirting like a god. Who gives a fuck about illiteracy? You are a hero, soldier. `/salute`.
