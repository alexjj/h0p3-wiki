It's good to see you again, and it's good to [[recent|Recent]]ly be back. We come and go, see each other when we can. I appreciate your reaching out to say anything. Thank you. I'm glad to receive your e-mail. I affirm your "hello" thesis; it's dope. 

I keep finding that life is full of surprises more important that novelty, and I'm glad. I'm a bit more out of my rut, I think. 

I'll continue thinking about your work across the web. Been thinking about your eye for UIs. If you ever have the time and inclination, I'd like to know where you think Pinephone tinkerers and devs should go in their UI work. I'm retarded here, so help me out.

`/wave` - I'm doing my best to avoid Discord, but just in case you might find it useful to be able to IM*

Snap, [[your wiki|https://wiki.tiv.today/]] is looking good. I'm looking forward to see where you take it. I [[hope]] the interview went well.

I'm sorry [[you are feeling disappointed|https://humdrum.life/2019/03/27/morning]]. You've been busy and not feeling great. I know that feel. =/ FWIW, I have been paying attention. I'm thinking alongside you, but I've not had anything to say. I'm still figuring out how to give the body-language nods in the appropriate places in the conversation train to demonstrate I'm listening even if I don't have anything to add yet. As usual, take your time responding. There's no rush.
