Yo
Aug 2 12:31am
I'm up
Aug 2 12:31am
I fell asleep drunk.
Aug 2 12:31am
Lol
Aug 2 12:31am
We should talk.
Aug 2 12:31am
U up for it.
Aug 2 12:32am
Battery

This is about my wife's grandma.
Aug 3 7:19pm

There are other articles on her about her surviving the 1918 flu pandemic.
Aug 3 7:47pm
Reminds me of a man whose blood donations have saved millions of lives.
Aug 3 7:48pm
How's your week been, sir?
Aug 7 2:01pm
It has been an OK. Week. How about yours?
Aug 7 5:59pm
Aye. Same. Lots of thinking. Teenagers and the world.
Aug 7 5:59pm
Mine hits me now. My preteen that is. Lol.
Aug 7 6:02pm
It was fun a few years ago. Now I tense up and prepare for some good licks. Haha
Aug 7 6:02pm
Lol. I hear that.
Aug 7 6:03pm
Any good plans for the weekend?
Aug 7 6:03pm
Last year, my daughter called me a pussy: https://philosopher.life/#2019.02.24%20-%20TLDR%3A%20A%20Car%20Ride - I'm glad to be her dad.
Aug 7 6:05pm
Weekend might be fun. We'll see. Sex, date, maybe a pizza, walking, talking, reading, and writing. Family Time.
Aug 7 6:05pm
How about you?
Aug 7 6:05pm
No plan. Guys at work taking vacation so kinda on call and extra responsibility including over the weekend.
Aug 7 6:07pm
So can't get too involved in anything. Or drink. Or... Lol
Aug 7 6:07pm

I hope you are well.
Aug 12 8:59pm
Yup. Well enough.
Aug 12 8:59pm
Just ate dinner.
Aug 12 8:59pm
It was good.
Aug 12 8:59pm
How about you?
Aug 12 8:59pm
12 hr day, engine change on EC135 and ops check including flight check. So I like to fly.
Aug 12 9:01pm
But hard to enjoy when I'm just reading numbers off the cockpit the entire time.
Aug 12 9:01pm
I had moments.
Aug 12 9:01pm
Surprisingly I never flew on a helicopter until I had this job.
Aug 12 9:02pm
That is dope.
Aug 12 9:02pm
Very cool looking helicopter too.
Aug 12 9:03pm
Fuxking eurocopter. Metric and everything. It is a huge pain in my ass but I am learning.
Aug 12 9:03pm
Lol
Aug 12 9:03pm
I think Americans are quietly converting to metric. It invades us.
Aug 12 9:03pm
Base 10 is based.
Aug 12 9:04pm
Nearly all aircraft are all standard. Except eurocopter.
Aug 12 9:06pm
So now I have to have dual sets of tools. Both standard and metric. So when Americans make modificationa to the airframe they use standard. But then everything else is metric. It's like working on a 1995 dodge pickup. It's everywhere.
Aug 12 9:08pm
=)
Aug 12 9:09pm
Work seems to be leveling. The people I work with are showing friendship attributes.
Aug 12 9:10pm
Good.
Aug 12 9:10pm
How's the family doing?
Aug 12 9:13pm
Meh. Good. The school opening postponed has been a sadness to my daughter, who is a social butterfly. There is something always wrong with my wife. I havent met a woman who doesn't have "pre existing conditions" hahah
Aug 12 9:15pm
Good is the real answer.
Aug 12 9:15pm
Comparatively
Aug 12 9:15pm
I hear ya. Well, I hope your daughter will find it an interesting season in her life anyway. I can imagine is sucks not to be able to see her friends everyday.
Aug 12 9:16pm
I am frustrated that I cannot be a part of it. I'm just working to make a dollar... Came home at 8 30 tonight.
Aug 12 9:18pm
Nothing you can do. =/
Aug 12 9:18pm
Finally "timed out" used up my 12 hours of work time today. So I grabbed a few beers before bed.
Aug 12 9:18pm
That sounds excellent. I need to get some.
