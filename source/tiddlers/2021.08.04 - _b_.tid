Don't lose your shit, [[k0sh3k]], <3. Being religious has helped me identify religious tendencies in the secular world (George Michael...). Ideology doesnâ€™t imply supernatural deities (though all things imply metaphysics), and it's almost as though some worldly phenomena can be elevated to a supernatural level. Secular belief contains rituals, origin stories, deities, saints, priesthood, blasphemy, vice & virtue just as religion does. I appreciate how religions work to explicitly codify and debate these aspects instead of conveniently hiding them away in nebulous implication. Those who claim not to be religious have, for one reason or another, ignored what their apparently secular ideologies axiomatically adopt and entail.

Sometimes I think that allowing or even agreeing with an evil person about how they are better than they actually are is like pushing them over the cliff or planting the seed of doubt.

Apparently, on the Everett interpretation: if everything happens, why should you care about what happens? Yet another fallacious consequentialist line of reasoning.
