* A reductionistic but incomprehensible explanation of the brain exists; it needs 'soft' concepts like levels, mappings, and meaning in order to be comprehensible.
* Emergent phenomena like the self and consciousness are 'Strage Loops' - paradoxical feedback loops between the bottom and the top levels.
* Consciousness and intelligence can be lifted right out of the hardware in which they reside; they are high-level, software properties
* intelligence arises out of the composition of unintelligent neurons, just as 'intelligent' colony behaviour emerges from unintelligent ants.
* The "I" is a tremendously effective, indispensable illusion, and falling for it has great survival value; it is the most precious thing we own.
* Each human head mirrors, and thus houses a large number of other "I"s - other human beings at vastly differing levels of detail and fidelity.
* Although any individual's consciousness is primarily resident in one particular brain, it is also somewhat present in other brains as well.
* When the central brain is destroyed, tiny fragments of the living individual remain alive in other brains, in personal notebooks, etc.
* Our decisions are made in the brain by an analogue to a voting process in a democracy as our desires chime in, constrained by external factors.
* Our will, quite the opposite of being free, is ready and stable, like an inner gyroscope, and it is the stability of our non-free will that makes us who we are.
