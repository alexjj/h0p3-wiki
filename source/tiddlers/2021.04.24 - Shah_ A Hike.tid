Apr 24 7:56am
Yeah. Im currently in Troy, NY. Was a fine drive yesterday. Now im waiting for my friend to wake up to finally meet him after a year.
Apr 24 7:57am
Think hes making me breakfast.
Apr 24 7:57am
2 hours, not a bad drive for breakfast with a friend.
Apr 24 7:57am
A year is a long time. I assume quarantine has been the primary reason.
Apr 24 7:58am
Yeah we were going to meet t
Apr 24 7:58am
Stupid phone
Apr 24 7:58am
We were going to meet last year in April but thats when covid peeked
Apr 24 7:58am
Peaked
Apr 24 7:58am
He got to fly back home to winsconsin. He goes to college in new york.
Apr 24 7:59am
Noice. It's a privilege to be able to go to college out of state.
Apr 24 8:01am
Hes somewhat wealthy. Father doctor, mother nurse. Hes fine.
Apr 24 8:10am
Saying somewhat cuz its his parents not physically him.
Apr 24 8:11am
Makes sense. I'd want to go to school in NY too in his shoes.
Apr 24 8:11am
Having wealthy parents is itself a privilege, no doubt.
Apr 24 8:12am
Thats pretty cool. I have a decent living. Like my mom owns a house. Shes currently going to college for nursing. She has her masters in healthcare management. My dad isnt shit and never will be shit. Don't like him, he manipulated me during my childhood.
Apr 24 8:19am
Oh, wow. She's gonna be decorated by the time it's all over. I bet this past year has been intense for her especially.
Apr 24 8:21am
Ah yeah, but to me she has a sugar mama in georgia.
Apr 24 8:22am
She bought her a puppy. Its coming Wednesday.
Apr 24 8:22am
Both of my donors are highly manipulative people. I don't talk to them at all (nor does my brother). I appreciate how difficult it can be.
Apr 24 8:22am
Mom hit me with the "you watching two dogs wednesday" im like huh? Guess im watching her dog too.
Apr 24 8:22am
Lol
Apr 24 8:22am
Donors? As in parents?

Aye. They don't deserve the title "parent," they didn't earn it. They were egg and sperm donors.
Apr 24 8:23am
Super cute dog.
Apr 24 8:23am
Ah yes..another insult to call my dad. "Donor"
Apr 24 8:23am
We just bought a house this January (well, we rent-to-own from the bank through the mortgage).
Apr 24 8:25am
I homeschool my offspring, and I write. It doesn't make money, but it's my vocation.
Apr 24 8:25am
Used to teach.
Apr 24 8:25am
I think my mom is doing that tbh
Apr 24 8:40am
If you have some form of income thats all that matters

That was your day today?
Apr 24 5:42pm
Lawd. Gorgeous.
Apr 24 5:42pm
And exhausting
Apr 24 5:42pm
How many miles you walk/hike to get there?
Apr 24 5:43pm
I find traveling to be exhausting in itself, often enough.
Apr 24 5:43pm
Homebody* here, ofc.
Apr 24 5:43pm
(though I've done my fair share of traveling)
Apr 24 5:43pm
Wasnt that far tbh it was a short trail but steep
Apr 24 5:46pm
We did both trails tho
Apr 24 5:46pm
Was there for an hour.
Apr 24 5:46pm
Due to my many pitstops cuz first time hiking and shit. Muddy and what not
