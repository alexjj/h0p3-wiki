title: 2020.08.18 - Wiki Review: Hold Me Naked, Cover Me.

* [[2020.08.17 - ???: REEE]]
** Edited. I still have no fucking clue what we are doing. They didn't seem to mind though.

** Edited. Feeling starved for sex. She needs to chill though, and that means I should too. I don't know what I'd do without my sex toys at this point. My hand and my soft fabrics only go so far. Still, the skinhunger is gnawing. Please, hold me [[naked]], cover me.

** TW is so inconvenient on the face of it. 
** I wonder if I will eventually be using overwrite/delete tools on Discord as I do on Plebbit.
*** I'm excited that [[kyr0ss]] has appeared to join me on Tox. I'll seek a proof of it.

** Completed. [[title.Title]] is an homage to my wife's. 
** Sometimes, my offspring and I can get shit done fast. It's a different pace when I'm leading rather than pointing (assuming I'm aiming to be productive, the likelihood of me calling you out increases when it's realtime).

** I now have a second coat of paint on it. I know my interlocutor claims not to be able to interpret me well, but it seems like they do. I'm gonna say it as well as I know how.

** This one is on hold. [[kyr0ss]] comes first.
