Woke at 6:30. Gumpin'. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Yogurt. ⁸Δ⁸.

//The Walk// with my sympaticon. They cut a lot of flowers and bushes down in the area. =/. Vapelyfe. Ran into the house along the manmade stream. Italian boomer, 31 years there, a stream of bullshit about his story, yes, sir. Thinking about which plants that were going to be destroyed anyway might be worth just transplanting. Cut it short, my sympaticon is toast.

[[5c0ut]] came down for our bi-monthly. Stages have been meh, but still lots to look around for. Might head back to country clubs. New job is hot, and they don't allow music. Not a fan of drug use either. Odd kitchen, surely. They know their shit though. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Sent mi amor to her hidey-spot in the [[garden]]. Dadnap. Woke at 2. Hotdogs. [[TTTOTW]]. Had ice cream with my daughter in the kitchen. Her day is going really well, wouldn't let me go until I told her mine. [[TTTOTW]]. Thinking about epilespy.

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor.

[[TTTOTW]]. Dialectics with my sympaticon. 

Pizza with my offspring, spontaneously. [[Unpredicted loud noise|https://i.redd.it/ogs5brnwz5991.jpg]] no bueno, but it's alright. Played the clarinet⁸. 

[[D2]] + //Borne// with my sympaticon, stopped at the beginning of Chapter 9. [[TTTOTW]]. Put mi amor to bed, lots of teasing. Cleaning up 3.5k tabs. I did really well to get below 2k, but it balloons so fast.
