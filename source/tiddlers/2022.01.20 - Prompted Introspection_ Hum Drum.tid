There's plenty of overlap, but these are my long-term favorite as well. These aren't always fun, and they aren't necessarily the most fun thing to do in every particular context (though that isn't what you've prompted me with, Samwise). The [[h0p3]] page and [[CTS]] tend to pick these out well enough. Some people might think these are dull or lacking. I've done plenty of things that were thrilling and novel, but these are timeless, perhaps necessary, consistently fun and moral, and I think the core fun activities of my life as well. There are parts of these that I would like to see changed, but overall, these are the activities I would like to engage in. I'm a homebody, a basement-dweller, and a hiki too, and I think one could design a residence that I could live in and never leave while remaining fairly happy. I want to be quarantined, locked away doing these things.
