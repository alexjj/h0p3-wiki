!! All the Generations Before Me

"""
All the generations before me donated me
little by little so I'd rise up all at once in Jerusalem
like a house of prayer or a charitable institution.
That's a big obligation. My name is the name of my donors.
That's a big obligation.

I am getting close to the age when my father died.
My will is patched in many places.
Each day I have to change my life and my death
to fulfill all the prophecies 
that prophesied me. So they won't be lies.
That's a big obligation.

I have passed my fortieth year. There are
places where I wouldn't be hired
for that very reason. If I'd been in Auschwitz,
they wouldn't have sent me to work,
they would have burned me on the spot.
That's a big obligation.

!! 15th Song of Zion the Beautiful

"""
Even my loves are measured by wars.
I say, "That happened after
the Second World War." "We met
a day before the Six-Day War." I would never say
"before the peace of '45-'48" or "in the middle of
the peace of '56-'67."

!! 21st Song of Zion the Beautiful

"""
Jerusalem's a place where everyone remembers
he's forgetten something
but doesn't remember what it is.

And for the sake of remembering
I wear my father's face over mine.

This is the city where my dream containers fill up
like a diver's oxygen tanks.

Its holiness
sometimes turns into love.

And the questions that are asked in these hills
are the same as they've always been: "Have you
seen my sheep?" "Have you seen
my shepherd?"

!! Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Why Jerusalem? #17

"""
In Jerusalem, hope springs eternal. Hope is like a faithful dog.
Sometimes she runs ahead of me to check the future, to sniff it out,
and then I call her: Hope, Hope, come here, and she
comes to me. I pet her, she eats out of my hand.
And sometimes she stays behind, near some other hope,
maybe to sniff out whatever was. Then I call her my Despair,
I call out to her: Hey, my little Despair, come here,
and she comes and snuggles up, and again
I call her Hope.
