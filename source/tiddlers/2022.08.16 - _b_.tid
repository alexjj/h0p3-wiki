Incumbent clouds oversubscribing compute by gouging on bandwidth and drive space are hostile environments for price-efficient, high throughput digital infrastructures, including overlay networks, bootstrapping nodes, and anything that philosophically counts as a VPN, foisting even more of the burden of decentralizing infrastructure onto already handicapped shoestring self-hosted distributed networks. What does a morally justified non-profit datacenter look like?

We need a p2p place to build communities for multisig social recovery ~~wallets~~ voting identities (which will essentially be wallets holding voice tokens to spend quadratically on how to distribute the rest of the resources this money is meant to liquify), hosting our encrypted data with a friendly crowd, etc.

There are almost always better options than a blockchain for solving the problems of multiple agents with competing needs who can't easily provision a neutral party while still making use [[shared]], open source protocols resistant to takeover by a single entity. e.g. [[Anonymized]] money can be handled through decentralized voucher systems. I'm interested in PoS blockchains only insofar as they are the fundamental fiat currency used to tax and redistribute. Nobody wants to build that blockchain; there's no profit in it for those whose material conditions would allow them to construct it, especially if they think there's faster, easier money to be made by abusing decentralization rhetoric to do the opposite.

I am wondering if the egoistic xenophobia that may emerge from climate migration will be the downfall of the EU, especially if they would rather maintain their national identities and downsize than help others (yet another Japanification).

online information sources transitioning to tiered subscription models serve primarily the elite who have the ability to pay to be effectively informed in their decisions, while the poor will be handed [[spectacular]] bundles of propatainment, and the reactionaries decry democracy as a concept, pointing to the real phenomenon of the masses being increasingly removed from the critical information loops while remaining in theatrical decision loops, embracing DL-empowered and radically automated decision processes based on that information and the modeling of individuals and emergent structures leads us all to serve our transnational corporate keiretsu oligarchs
