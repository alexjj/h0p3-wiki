//This one has a sat on my palette for a long time. I've worked hard to use the wiki as //the// un[[/b/]]uffered place where I write everything, but there's a place on my drive that broke the spirit of that rule last year.<<ref "r">> However minimal, inevitably, there is a separation between the pilot's seat and the audience's. Cleansing my shitty palate, I'm sucking Jung's [[/b/]]ollocks for my [[/b/]]alloon-popping penance. No, it's not a coherent piece. [mmdd].//

This [[PH]] List of sentences is [[/b/]]-ish [0228].

Freely offering my words, and feel free to ignore them [0401]. Your words to me are mine to spend as well [0917]. My life has been on-the-line for many years [0529]. If you respected my privacy so much, you wouldn't be reading these words [0305]. To what extent must I actively pursue the question of [[W5H]] I should or should not enable others access to my computers [0713]? I'm going to run with my insanity [0307]. I am more likely to all in than most people [0305].

I love you, and here is what it means to say I love you [0228]. We rely upon [[the other]] to [[name]] us, not just with us, but also for us [0409]. There is a necessity to being anxious [[irwartfrr]] with each [[other]]; we have to trust in the other way down to have them tell us what they see, as we need existential mirrors [0409]. I'm always in the process of earning and learning trust [0326]. I don't know if I want to fight you or fuck you, but I know I can't fly away [0923]. Being chased, not chaste [0922].

I put you on such a high pedestal, you dare not fall off it [0606]. You are going to have to tell me why [0228]. Be frictionless or sharp [0326]. Take me for the proverbial ride [0228]. Am I your NPC, a skinnerbox tit [0523]? I think plenty of times people speak with me because they don't know well enough who they are or what they want, even when we are speaking of The World [1216]. 

Perhaps insofar as I'm attractive, it's, in part, due to the fact that I could live without almost any people in the world [0619]. If I were reducible to a virus, I'd be fairly intolerable [0228]. You are going to have to dislike me; I have a moral right to causing it in some cases [0406]. You are conveniently unwilling to give me accountably justified reasons why you won't be happy with my identity [0629]. 

I have little patience for those who say they don't want to think about something because it makes them feel bad [0307]. You often mean the world can't change because you aren't willing to sacrifice your resources or recognize the evil of who you've been [0603]. And, yes, I definitely judge people on the reasons they give for why they love, hate, like, or want not to want in their phones [0228].<<ref "i">> We must be prodigal-loving brethren [0409]. 

Sometimes you have to get naked, scream in the market, tell people they aren't god or the sun, and throw chickens at people [0228]. I'm looking for The Truth, not just your truth [0705]. You are living proof to me that your god doesn't exist [0305]. I would kill you except that I accept my own rules aren't just for me [0325]. Perhaps [[The Original Position]] is a constructivist's synthetic a priori CI generator AI [0520]. I'm a living extension of my legislation [0623]. What is The Dialetheia that reaches into us [0228]?<<ref "d">>

And, then, as they say, Anon woke up.

<<footnotes "i" "If I had 10 trillion dollars [0307]...The person handing flowers to others on the side of the road is doing some measure of good, and in some cases, fulfills a unique role in the dialectic. However, distributing flowers solves a very narrow set of problems in the world [0615].">>

<<footnotes "d" "Charlie is a ghost of some future me [0228]. Identifying With: Ghosts [0228]. The Angel of Plants is another ghost [0228]. What do you have to say, angel [0228]? We are the branches, and together we are the tree; let us be the most beautiful and righteous tree in the forest of who we could possibly be [0228].">>
