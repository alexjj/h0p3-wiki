title: 2020.09.22 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Gettin' Boomered

* Woke at 1
* [[Morning Routine]]
* //Walk With Offspring//
** Daughter clearly has a plan: throw dad into the rabbithole so he won't talk about school with us, lol.
*** It works.
** Turns out, the tent that has been brought down was damaged. We just didn't see it. KO. Tango Down.
** We made the choice to pack it up and bring it home. 
** Saw Howard and Ellen. As they saw us in the distance, they reached for their phones. Probably Boomered here. Lol.
** Still thinking from afar what it's like to do schoolwork with them. It's like asking my children "what did you do in school today?" as though they don't attend mine. 
*** Though we are in school always.
** We arrived home very late (didn't have our phones on us, so didn't even get the messages). It is rare that she comes home and we aren't there without her knowing. 
* Looked at more places we might live.
* //Skintime//
** I'm a greedy sumbitch
** Listened to her day. Grindy, but simplifying. Being able to work onsite for only a few hours made it so she didn't waste any time. 
*** I hope this is permanent. 
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Offspring made chicken tikka masala, rice, kiwi. 
** //ATLA//. They won't watch shows on their own. Only with us...I do not understand.
** Beers
* Nap
