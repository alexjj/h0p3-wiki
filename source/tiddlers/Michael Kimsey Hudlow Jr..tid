Come and speak with [[me|https://philosopher.life]]. I will give you a fair interrogation.

<<<
I'm not familiar with the domain that you linked at all. But after reading the disclaimer...

I think i may have to pass.
<<<

I'm glad you have the freedom to pass, officer.

<<<
If you have to have a disclaimer saying that your works are works of fiction and the product will be the result of your (if youre the author) imagination, then im not really interested in my potential words being used to satisfy your imagination. Doesn't sound like a fair shake to me.
<<<

Of course, I'm interested in what you are and aren't interested in, officer. I'm grateful that you have such a clear and distinct notion of what consists in justice as fairness. What's a fair shake to you here, and what makes it fair? We're just talking, right?

<<<
I believe that my words should be portrayed fairly and represent the true intentions of my words. Although it is your right to represent my words any way you so choose, using your imagination to misrepresent them would be a disservice.

That being said, my voice is not the only one that deserves to be represented fairly. Everyone's voice should be given that same opportunity. I understand that there are many injustices in the world today, specifically the injustice that Mr. Floyd was the victim of. I sincerely hope that we can all come together and find our one collective voice safely and peacefully. We can only hope for a world where everyone's voice is given equal representation regardless of race, religion, creed, sexual orientation, and career. You can choose to interpret those words any way you choose, but know that my intent is one based out of love for my fellow human. And I can only hope that you will choose to represent them as such. Much loveâ™¡

We are so lucky to hear your privileged words, officer. I'm glad you understand there are injustices in the world. Yes, racism is truly evil. Of course, your ability to pick out part of the injustice in Mr. Floyd's case is hardly an indication that you have picked out what is systemically unjust. 

What does it mean to portray your words fairly? What does it mean to represent the true intention of your words? Forgive me for being such a pedant, but could you specify what kind of right I have to misrepresent them, and what justifies it? I know, I know: it seems like common sense, officer. Bear with me please, I'm slow.

I wholeheartedly agree to our moral rights and obligations to fair representation in legislation, adjudication, and execution. Do you believe you are especially accountable to the public for providing an articulate and well-defended justification for the power you have wielded over people? That seems fair to me. Surely, officer, the manner in which you've coerced your fellow humans was so carefully selected with the best intentions. You must be an excellent and wise person. Why should you have had the right to wield such power? 

Of course, note the difference between what ones says and what one intends. Given that you likely served the wealthy far more than the average citizen, it seems fair to assume that your words aren't an honest indication of your motivations. 

I'm going to do you a favor in our conversation. I do agree that the Rule of Law is morally justified, including enforcement. I'm interested to see if you are actually a just police apologist. I too, of course, sincerely [[hope]] that we can all come together in peace and harmony, but it may require dealing with injustice (the sort caused by those in power). Your Reason is exactly what I respect about you and any other person, officer. I also aim to forgive people for their mistakes. As always, I aim to do you justice.
