title: 2021.11.01 - Prompted Introspection: Seduction Training

!! What's your opinion of education that teaches men to be more seductive?

It depends on the education and the man. Am I being taught to be seductive when I'm told to make myself look more presentable (oh, I should shower?), or to bring her flowers, or to listen carefully to her? Yes, though perhaps not thoroughly or effectively. Am I being trained to treat her as mere means? Not necessarily. Insofar as conditioning trains others to treat others as mere means, and plenty of approaches to seduction encourage this or passively allow the interpretation, that conditioning is wrong; it seeks to produce psychopathy. There can, however, be moral education (as Saint Aristotle picked out long ago for us), including on becoming morally seductive. It doesn't matter if this conditioning is for men in particular;<<ref "w">> it matters whether or not it's moral.

<<footnotes "w" "Let's be clear: female seduction industries are substantial and historically the far greater force in the world in many respects (it is far more difficult to draw the lines when we expand to include our very lives as being non-trivially concerned with remaining attractive to [[the other]], particularly in capitalist environments). I see exploitation all over the place, of course.">>
