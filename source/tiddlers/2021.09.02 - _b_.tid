Priestly artists elicit The Sublime; in [[awe]], we instantly recognize the necessity of divinity through a lived experience. What [[good]] is art if it does not make progress toward making one's (or better yet, all of our) religion(s) more tangible or immanent?

Sexbots can't replace women because no one wants to ride a cold, emotionless chunk of manufactured machinery, just as there's no way automobiles will ever replace horses. XD. No matter what: let's ride.

Apparently, the sweetspot on wagecuckery is being interested enough to be efficient but disinterested enough to not care about decisions you don't like while having enough freetime to scratch your itches. Just accept being treated like a disposable, fungible object, with no inherent value in the process, and, voila, you'll have achieved a safe, sustainable, sane minimum of happiness.

As a technocratic apatheist who revels in exploiting behavioral determinism, my only hope of entertainment is mimetically cultivating nihilism by spamming inconsequential content.

I have never been good at defining pain. The functionalist may not always do such a good job at distinguishing between nociception and pain (what is generally a complex emotional and embodied response, no doubt). There's physiological reasons for it that make sense (and you'll move your hand away from the hot pan before you feel pain bubble up), and perhaps the functions are different enough. Supposedly functionalism is agnostic to the problem of dualism, but if it takes dualism seriously enough, doesn't it have to admit insufficiency? Without more openly admitting the inherent problems of interpreting blackbox functions, functionalism itself poses a trojan horse (ironically).
