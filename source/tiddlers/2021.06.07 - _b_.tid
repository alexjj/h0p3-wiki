Why aren't there authentic performances again? I agree that the circumstances which bring it about can be unjustified, but surely it can be a worthy, genuine moral choice (even if you didn't have much of a political one) in at least some cases.

Look around your circles for those who are blooming crypto-boomers who only claim to be socialist because it's expedient and suits their current desires and feelings. Who would they be with wealth (or even the opportunity to be wealthy)? Integrity in one's [[4DID]] isn't cheap (and, of course, integrated evil obtains, and not all forms of integrity are justified, i.e. some people should radically change and lose connection with their past). Quit cappin. This has happened before, and it will happen again. Yes, rational agents will tend to converage on the same {[[Axioms]]}.

Seems like The Orthogonality Thesis applies to all non-identical minds in varying [[dok]], though it's unobvious the degree to which intelligence and utility functions can be peeled apart. I'm not a functionalist though, and I believe in freewill, qualia, and metaphysics, so my opinion won't seem relevant to the average neo-rationalist.

Hao 2 Situationist: learn French, speak obscurely with big words (the thesaurus is not only terrible, it's also terrible), harp on [boredom, poverty, and pleasure], constantly reference Dada and Surrealist movements, attack academia and art while only attending prestigious schools and being surrounded almost exclusively by artists, megalomaniacally take credit for shifts in political landscapes through detournement maymaying, take it for granted everyone is intimately familiar with your work while maintaining a highly exclusive group, talk about the proletariat without actually associating with any of them, and avoid appearing poor.

Sometimes systematically obsessed with imaginary worlds (and characters) to escape overwhelming stimuli I can't ignore because muh brain inflexibly gives overwhelming weight to sensory input. Yet, I think this often helps me balance coherence with accuracy to find [[salience]].

Neurotypicals may be more likely to take social approval signaling as doxastic justification. When nobody objects, they may be more likely to unquestioningly affirm the naked emperor is wearing clothes. There may be contexts in which high-functioning autists might be more likely to cut through groupthink, social imprecision, and the unconscious passion which overrides reason.
