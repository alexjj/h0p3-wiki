title: 2020.05.23 - Prompted Introspection: Why Journal

!! Why do you journal?

It's interesting to me that both [[2018.01.21 - Prompted Introspection Log: Journal Justification]] and [[2018.12.14 - Prompted Introspection: Why Do I Journal?]] have explicit interlocutors. Yes, {[[About]]} continues to be the most concise reason. Obviously, my wiki as journal has some odd properties to it, including its publicness. Why do I write this wiki? The reasons continue to grow. 

Even as a vat of puke, I think it's [[beautiful]] sometimes. I think it's the [[right]] thing thing to do for myself, my offspring, my [[others]], and even strangers that may happen upon it. It can be a ton of fun too, even if most of the time it's a lot of work. I also journal because it's a habit now, a habit I wish I had from the beginning.
