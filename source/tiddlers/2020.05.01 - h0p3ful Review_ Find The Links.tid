*[[Friendship]]
** Hope you have more tomorrow, love.
*** Speaking of which, I have nothing.
*[[2020.04.30 - h0p3ful Review: Best Drawing Ever]]
** Someone who cares about storytelling as much as you should dive deeply into [[The Great Human Conversation]]. I'm just going to keep saying it, like a broken record. 
*[[2020.04.30 - YTDL: I Saw a Flock of Moosen]]
** Lame. 
*** At the very least, you should leave jokes in here.
*[[2020/04/30 -- Antipleonasm Analysis: I Can Make You]]
** `/bears`. 
*** I think you should do more of this risk-taking. Ask us to bear with you as you try to get it out into whatever words you have. That's a hard place to be. Keep going.
**** To be clear, this is far more elegant than I'm talking about. You should put down scraps of jumbled thoughts too. There's gold up in there. Bullet-pointed bullshit is where it starts often enough.
** Link to [[1984]]. I want you to start seeing your wiki as something which has to be woven. Aim to link as a kneejerk reaction.
*** I know, I'm giving you the spiel again. It's one of the skills and aspects of your wiki that will set you and it apart though. I am impoverished here; you could be a hypertext GM. You have to practice though.
**** That reminds me of your question here about D&D,<<ref "r">> MUDs and forum-based RPing might not be as fun as doing it live, but there's something there for you. I hope you RP in [[VIXI]] (or with VIXI) hardcore. RP by mail, writing in character, or hypertext LARPing or something. I don't know where I'm going with this. Maybe you need an inner and outer wiki (excellent for worldbuilding, stats, etc. too). I'm simply underwhelmed by what I find from the RPers who use wikis; you could go hardcore and do it all. Fearlessly explore. Go make mistakes.
***** I have no idea how to tie different timelines together. The DM kinda has to do that work (or maybe there's some way for players to cooperate). I don't know enough. This isn't my thing, but it might be yours. Giving hypertext structure to freeform RP...
*[[2020/04/30 -- Prompted Introspection: For Ever and Ever]]
** Give us links to where you've discussed it frequently.
** Yeah, I can see how your footnote is "pure aesthetic" here.
** We're getting to a point where I think the first thing you should do after you've set a prompt is to search your wiki, [[Prompted Introspection]] in particular (and exclusively, if you prefer, for now), for related content.
*** It's hypertime for hyperyou to hyperstart hyperliving in hypertext.
*[[2020/04/30 -- Life Log]]
** Oops. Should fill this one out, eh? 
*** Why not now?
*[[The Lightning Thief // Chapter Eight]]
** GL, woman.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** How did I forget you read //1984// before, [[2018/05/01 -- Deep Reading Log]]?
** Please tag [[1984]]. Make it easy to collect all the books you've read in one spot.
** I'm increasingly glad you are atomizing instead of [[2019/05/01 -- Writing Log]]. I don't have knock down, drag out arguments for it (even if it's standard in CS), but it appears to be the correct direction.
*** Thank you.
** [[2019/05/01 -- Mathematics Log]] is deplorable. Lol.
