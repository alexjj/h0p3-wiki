*** A beautiful and hilarious polemic. Terse rehearsal of a dismissal. An insider's retelling of history and historiography of key words. Wonder what [[RLichtenstein]] would think in her atypical fashion. Surprisingly, a line reminded me of [[nomasters]]. Have my disagreements, of course. Almost always do. Not The Last Marxist (as hilarious as calling myself The Last Hope or The Last Philosopher), especially with a lack of technical skill and analytic moral philosophy under their belt. Can tell this one is still struggling with a pomo bourgeois identity. Brilliant AF.
