title: 2021.07.29 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Let's Bake (NOT Break) Banana Bread Together

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Cleaning. Foot bath. [[TTTOTW]]. Attempted Omegle, but I just didn't have the heart for it. Instead, hummus + olives + pita + LolVod. And, I cleaned up some [[vidya]] files by hand (there's something soothing to doing it manually with keyboard shortcuts, and takes less focus than a more traditional coding answer [at the end of the day, manual is really more my style anyway]). 

3:30 she comes down.<<ref "w">> Wide awake, chipper even for someone who needs her sleep.<<ref "i">> Take back my claim about gaba; that shit do be hittin' for sleep even if it doesn't solve the muscular problem. I chased her to the stairs (a cute waddle, the barest minimum viable presentation of not wanting to be caught, tonight) to sustain my argument (and receive at least the: "I'll think about it and try") and get my stair-hugs (see, she stands one step above and leans onto me [hhhnnggggg]).<<ref "t">> She's promised to take the day off and just stay home. GOOD. Always worried that everything will fall apart if she's not there, abused by her employers (bad).

Woke at 10. Not enough, but couldn't sleep again. Instead, Looonnggg Meditation. 


//Foundation// @ 3:24:56 with my offspring. They are missing some things now according to them. Well, it's a good thing it's a series that should be read more than once. My son was able to answer all my questions though, so I'm not worried. 

//Skintime//. Inform the Men! There is no substitute, Hedonismbot, and I'm (un)reasonably practiced at trying fabricate it. I feel so much better. Meditation. [[TTTOTW]]. Shower of the gods!

Lightning Struck! Double relief. 

Son and I made dinner. We made tuna (as we had both been craving it yesterday, and it was good idea), toasted sourdough, melons, potato soup, and water. We continue to smash through the last season of //Arrested Development//.

[[Family Gathering]] sans [[5c0ut]]@work. 

Took a nap, naked. Someone came into my room.

Lightning Struck! :P

Offspring failed to accomplish cleaning kitchen. I think they will in their 20's before they decide to do what they know they ought to do.

And, plus, what else are you supposed to do in your containers, your bus stops, your beaches, your funeral homes (I got you all //beat//...let me continue the horrifying list [frankly, as many priests obviously know: you've not really lived until you've had sex in a church]). Always remember to leave them a present.">>
