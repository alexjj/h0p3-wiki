** Surely, one day, we will strictly communicate in symbols.

** Why have two? Just use this one and caption.

** I'm surprised to see you keeping this one in your wiki. Neat. 
*[[2020.07.13 – Mathematics Log:]]
** I think this should be a single log for now. No reason to burn tiddlers on this.
*[[2020.07.13 – Wiki Review: there, they're their, and here.]]
** I'm excited to hear what you have to say about it. 
*** In addition to your reading, I think you should also consider checking out Youtube videos on people this famous too. Solid intros/primers. 
**** This one is fun: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_96tczP_eaY
*[[2020.07.13 – TDL: They'll never know. :)]]
** Lol! I have no idea how people would respond to it. Presumably, they wouldn't care (which is the point).
** You have interesting picks in here. Keep fleshing it out. This one isn't fun, I know.
*[[2020.07.13 – Prompted Introspection: Cheatin and not reportin]]
** Considering the barriers autism has put before you here, I think you do a great job of picking out microexpressions, tone, conversational implicature, and the seemingly ineffable parts of how we communicate as humans. I am glad that you and your sister understand each other so well.

** I am pleased to see some particular flesh here. Thank you, sir.
** We got some amazing food this week. We are lucky.

** You will have to pave your own way with how to structure and tag. 
*** With some work, naming conventions should enable you to remove the <<tag "To:">> tag eventually. I'm not there yet myself. Just something to think about for now.
*** I admire how you aim to create new conventions and break old ones in your wiki. There must be some structure, but it can be invaluable to openly experiment. 
**** Great part is: you are very young. I would take lots of risks now to develop.
** I think it's sweet that you have tagged your sister in here. 
*** As we have talked about, we must build fires, bridges of reference, shared languages, and doorways for each person. We aim for the impossible as realists in mapping our qualias together. May they be great. I hope your bond with your sister will be the strongest of any siblings I've encountered.
** I like that you are trying to demonstrate picking out the important part. Why not just quote only the important part from the beginning though?
** You will probably not remember that we have talked about Isaiah Berlin and Hobbes on this matter, but you make important moves they would know deeply.
** I appreciate your analysis here. Good work.

** I respect your honesty, sir. It's very expensive sometimes, and I'm grateful that you care enough to say the truth as best you can.
