I paused the wiki BEFORE I found this video.
Jan 14 9:23am
That was the beginning of my evening. After speaking with you about [[Sphygmus]] (Sphygmus), I've been thinking more. I've been curling up, and I'm just gonna man up and tell her the truth. I wanted to give us space, so I paused the wiki for her (I've never done that for anyone).
Jan 14 9:25am
Found the video a couple hours ago from a message someone left me on Reddit.
Jan 14 9:25am
