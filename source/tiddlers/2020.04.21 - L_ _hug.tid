[1:12 PM] h0p3: <3, hope you have a good day, gettin' all the stuff done with time to chill.

[2:36 PM] h0p3: How's it going?
[5:05 PM] Sohalia: It is going!
[5:05 PM] h0p3: Good. :slight_smile:
[5:05 PM] Sohalia: I am convinced walks work miracles at this point
[5:05 PM] h0p3: /hug
[5:06 PM] Sohalia: They seem to improve our mental health drastically, and when we miss them [[K]] and I generally have worse days
[5:06 PM] h0p3: I am glad you guys get to do it. It's an art, discipline, and joy, imho.
[5:06 PM] h0p3: (I was just about to head out on mine ;P)
[5:07 PM] Sohalia:

[5:07 PM] Sohalia: Belated hug in the weirdest gif form I could find
[5:07 PM] h0p3: Awww. :slight_smile: Thank you.
[5:07 PM] h0p3: It's awesome.
[5:08 PM] h0p3: Spirals are my favorite shapes.
[5:08 PM] h0p3: Deeply so.
[5:08 PM] Sohalia: Enjoy your walk! I will be here making homemade beef vegetable stew.
[5:08 PM] h0p3: Delightful. That sounds really good.
[5:08 PM] Sohalia: I should get you a spiral wind chime. Those things are absolutely mesmerizing.
[5:09 PM] Sohalia: It is! We cheat and use canned stuff more often than not, but itâ€™s delicious and super filling. Stew and cornbread!
[5:11 PM] h0p3: Heck yeah. I think soup is something I grow fonder of over time.
