Hey there ! I have missed you. The chickens are good ‚Äîthe rest of ys are good. I need a break from the covid stuff bleh! How are you folks?
Sep 16 5:24pm
Heyas! I missed you too. I love you.
Sep 16 5:24pm
I love you too!
Sep 16 5:25pm
I am glad to hear everyone's doing well. I assume you've been in trenches between school, grad school, the world, and running your house.
Sep 16 5:25pm
Yeah the house needs the most attention but the other stuff is the most urgent
Sep 16 5:26pm
We're hanging in there. My offspring have learned how to effectively ignore me, lol. So, it's been smoother. They get done what they get done. I'll take it. We've been looking at houses (just dreaming).

[[k0sh3k]]'s been back on-site, doing what she can. Might be able to move back to working part of the time at home (which would be amazing).
Sep 16 5:27pm
That would be pretty awesome ‚Äîan old New England home
Sep 16 5:27pm
Working from home would be nice ‚ÄîI kind of like the peace of my classroom when there are no kids after school
Sep 16 5:28pm
I have always thought it was a place of meditation for you.
Sep 16 5:28pm
You know how to be at home in a classroom too.
Sep 16 5:29pm
Schoollyfe
Sep 16 5:29pm
The kids this year have been really good ‚Äîeven with all the corona crap
Sep 16 5:29pm
Woot!
Sep 16 5:29pm
That is good to hear.
Sep 16 5:30pm
I don't get to speak to many young people these days. How are they feeling?
Sep 16 5:30pm
They are ready for all this no mask stay away stuff to be over
Sep 16 5:31pm
Not afraid though‚Äîjust ready to be back to normal
Sep 16 5:31pm
I hear that.
Sep 16 5:33pm
How are [[UJ]] and [[AG]] doing?
Sep 16 5:33pm
They are good
Sep 16 5:40pm
[[AG]] decided she wants to be home more than she wants the money cooking french fries üçü. We shall see how that goes
Sep 16 5:41pm
[[UJ]] volunteered to do a 15 mile bike ride...I expect to be called to come get him from whatever he pulls doing that
Sep 16 5:41pm
Hehe
