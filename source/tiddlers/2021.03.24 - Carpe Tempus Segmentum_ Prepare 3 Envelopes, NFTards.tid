title: 2021.03.24 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Prepare 3 Envelopes, NFTards

Slept, maybe. I don't know. Probably. Wine fucks with my sleep. I know that. =). Wired when I got up, horny as usual, but feeling the need to [[TTTOTW]]. So do!<<ref "c">>

Picked up a mechanical drain snake and the rice we needed. The last //Lazarus// book. All new. So delicious. I'm trying to take it slow, like a mature adult. Laundry. Someone left her blanket for me. =). [[TTTOTW]]. Chilled with mi amor as she went about her day, had some chips, Hugs'n'bugs with my offspring.

Sleep again. Glorious. [[TTTOTW]]. Hugs'n'bugs. Nobody was proud, but it wasn't a total waste. Trying to get [[CTS]] back online for them. [[Scout]] is feeling pretty awful today. Wealthy institutions fucking with his life. Ugh. He is upset, understandably. Took some time to breathe and we'll keep hacking at it.

Our dishwasher is acting up. Brother helped me look through the paperwork for it. "AE" code on it, says there's flooding. Found the sensor and the catch at the bottom. Not a ton, but enough to make it go off. Breakers off, removed the plate, soaked it up, breakers on, it works, for now. Yet another possible plumbing problem in that kitchen. I am extremely [[grateful]] to have a kitchen. 

Clean & Organize. Mo' Laundry. Set up the room for a massage, trying to make it cozy. She was loose, didn't need one for that (but probably needed one anyway). It was nice. An hour of touching her body is what I want. //Skintime// -> Assisted Fireman Time! She's graciously allowing me to borrow her blanket. Need 15 minutes a day with her on Mark-V. Want her to feel comfortable on it. Make it hers. 

Local-[[FTO]] and played matches with my offspring. Trounced my daughter, stupid openers from me (a T5 win in limited). Mulls, screw, and my son having tons of answers was an 0-2 for me. Came so close in G2 multiple times, but G1 was absolutely his. Drew his entire deck out and Elixir cycled with clamp and token generators, could just keep throwing his deck at me every turn. G2, I sat on Rude Awakening eating 3 a turn, busting through counters with bombs (and he Fire/Ice's like an oldschool pro), but Elixir plus EtW on the final turn sealed the deal (brought him to 1). Not a thing I could do. GG&GJ.

[[Family Gathering]] was excellent. Took a while for everyone to get to the table, but it was joyful. [[Scout]] made his own BBQ sauce (showoff :P), and it was delicious. A nice salad and even extra Indian food in case we would run out (we didn't, tons!). Talked and played cards.

[[TTTOTW]]. Considered responding to [[MJos]] [[re|https://www.maxwelljoslyn.com/2021/03/24/1]], but I've been there, done that. Don't think my opinion needs to be said further here. 

Made sure kitchen was in order. Saw folks off to bed. My daughter points out that I clearly have a 9-to-5 job, but it's 9pm-to-5am, hehe. Yes, ma'am. [[TTTOTW]]. Coffee. =)
