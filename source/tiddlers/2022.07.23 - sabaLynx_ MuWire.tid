You can join mine. But, I almost never use it anymore. It's barren. Mail seems to be the best option, imho. Btw, it's a pleasure to meet you. My name is [[h0p3]]. This is me: https://philosopher.life/

Yeah, this works great for e-mail (though it doesn't create notifications for me). I also have h0p3@protonmail.com. My [[contact]] information can be found here: https://philosopher.life/#Contact%20h0p3

Try right-clicking on my name or using my key. Should be able to "Chat" with me as a drop down menu, I believe.

You might have to add me as a contact first.

I have an older copy of MuWire (haven't upgraded yet), but I have a "Chat" tab between "Messages" and "Contacts". When [I] right-click on my contact inside of the "Contacts" tab, I am offered a drop-down menu with the option to "Chat". You can also just take my full-key and enter that into the "Connect to Remote Server" in the "Chat" tab. Both of these should work.
