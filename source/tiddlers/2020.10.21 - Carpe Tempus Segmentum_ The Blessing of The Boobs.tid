title: 2020.10.21 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: The Blessing of The Boobs

We should have a powerpoint day. Just make the worst possible powerpoints for [[Family Gathering]], X slides, Y minutes, Z pukes. What would I subject them to? Lol. I need to hand draw one of the slides. I know I can make people leave the room, but where is the line where they'll stay, like hover right on it? How many penii can I hide? What is the real thesis and thrust of the presentation going to be? It should be on Leading Team Groupness. Yesh. Great Scott.

* Read+Write
* Checked SUV. Nothing. Not clear he actually charged it. Now I'm trying.
* Read+Write
* AFireman Time!
* LoL
* Sleep by 6
* Woke at 1ish
* [[Morning Routine]]
** No time to slap the bop.
** Might be worth going up to two sets of exercise a day. You need a row/chin-up bar again.
* Nope, zero electricity. Fek.
* Also, it's Nov 10 now instead of Dec 2 on possibly closing. Wow. That's crazy.
* Read+Write+Walk+Talk
* Walk With Offspring
** My son lied to me at the end, and it bit him in the butt later. =/. 
** 75% of the walk before we touched school (wish we had more time). We all had a lot of pieces to say, and we had to maintain a queue to unravel it. 
** Had fun thinking about what we'd be doing for the rest of the evening.
** Howard and Ellen, and despite walking a way, Howard had a timely line that may signal more (and if so, `/wave` - we can speak at length if you wish, of course): "how does it feel to have such a hyperfluorescent father?" - We all giggled and said nothing (offspring weren't sure what to say, ofc). 
* Shopping @ Aldi
** Practiced my yodeling in the parking lot. It turns her on (though she will, ofc, furiously argue the exact opposite, excepting having heard me say this).
*** My hypothesis is that she likes that social conventions should be set aside just to celebrate that it's me and her right there. I'm her retard. I'm happy to make a fool of myself for her. And, no correlationsies, the wooing clearly just werx.
**** I consider it one of my talents that I can make most people realize I'm ignoring almost everything and everyone else to speak with just them. In addition, I can sometimes say multiple things with different people using the same object (and, while this technique shares something in common with dogwhistling, it's not the same).
** It is quite a luxury to be able to walk into Aldi and feel like I could have any particular thing I wanted if I felt it was really worth buying. 
** Paul is doing alright. Been a while since I've seen him.
* Shower of the gods!
* Inform the Men!
* Meditation
* Shower of the gods!
* Offspring and I cooked
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Kielbasa, kraut, onions, melon, beer
** Prepared our presentations
** My son had a single slide with everyone on it. Yup. I hear ya. 
** My daughter gave a well-motivated and slick presentation on why presentations suck and she hates them (inspired edge).
** Boob talk, indeed, boobs talk. Poor people have to hear the schizotard deliver his sermon on boobs.
* Realtor seemed to be in heavy agreement with us. I do not know what to say about this. She might just say, "yes, I agree" without fitting justification.
* Ice Cream. Fuck yeah. $2 is hard to beat. Hard to imagine how two apples costs more than the quart of ice cream.
* Vapelyfe
* Read+Write+Walk+Talk

!! Very Important Powerpoint Presentation:<<ref "t">>

Sadly, missing the carefully curated images. So much time poured into this one over dinner. Syntax somewhat desugared and those semantics at least partially desprankled.<<ref "s">>

Tit Facts:

* Squeezing breasts may prevent cancer
* Looking at breasts lowers blood pressure
* Men who are hungry, sexist, seeking less submissive partners, interested in fatherhood, or who are poor may prefer: big tiddies
* Staring at boobs extends a man’s life by five years
* The average boob weighs between one and two pounds
