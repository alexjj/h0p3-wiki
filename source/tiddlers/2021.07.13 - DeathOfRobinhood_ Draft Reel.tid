lmao
adorable
Yall having a good day of rest?
It was nice, someone brought us a warm focaccia and some spicy italian sausage soup
Just chilling now, and will probably prepare for bed in about an hour
How was your day?
That sounds like a damn good meal.
Mine has been solid. [[Family Time]]. Day of reckoning for the offspring, as it often is. Once that's over, it becomes lighter and easier.
May the hard and heavy bits produce their weight in glory and more.

[[DeathOfRobinhood]] demo reel 2021
[[REDACTED]]

Early draft of the new reel I'm working on. Hoping to release it in the fall.

I've shown it to a couple of my peers. Paying attention to the negative comments more than the positive which are less helpful.

Big neg is that the music takes up too much space (i chose many of my shots to complement the music, which i took as a plus).

What do you, and [[j3d1h]], think?
Hrm. We are not qualified to judge. We both really liked the music part (so we're confused). We //know// we are watching a highlight/demo reel, and we liked the energy. [[j3d1h]] said that if you really had to change it, maybe you'd only time the shots to the most crucial parts of the song. We think the sheer variety of topics and styles are impressive (someone is jelly). We're trying to come up with negative feedback on purpose here (it's not easy). Imho, 1:32-1:51 feels off a bit (but I have no idea how to explain why). You could continue to vamp up the intro and outro, but we also think that the animation is supposed to overshadow these parts.
What don't you like about it?
Perhaps it could be improved, but I don't know how it could be improved. If it isn't hell, make more? Maybe you'll know why you like or don't like parts of it through that process.
(we fans, not critics)
Hah, well, please underatand me. I like it too! I put most of it together during a sleepless late night/early morn hurricane of inspiration.
But i have a savvy, PRACTICAL, friend who saw it, and said that it might be alienating. That it forefronted the wrong things, and that it might not get me hired.
But i didnt weave this web to catch just *any* bug, you know?
I take his criticism seriously though. I'll sit on it awhile before i do any serious retooling.
And your impressions are valuable to me. So thank you [[h0p3]] and [[j3d1h]]!
1:32-1:51 
Mm...let's say its because there's far less correspondence between image and lyrics than there has been up until that point?
The subsequent middle eastern war scene and subsequent tank could also be perceived as kind of contentious politically. I just wanted something to correspond to 'desert', and i liked having a tank there when the song goes about "treading" the surface (this could be an example of letting the song lead, rather than the more conventional practice of using it as a support. I probably would not have used those shots without the lyrical prompting).
