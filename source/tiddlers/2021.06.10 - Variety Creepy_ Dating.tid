"""
Hey bro..?
Can you help me with some dating advice?
I am happy to give you my opinion, but I do not think highly of my opinion in that sphere. I'm absolutely retarded, for real. 
As an autistic person, I have been on dates and didn't even know I was on a date (just thought it was two people who enjoyed being with each other, being friends, etc.).
Dude, but you surely are more experienced than me in this.
Probably, but not by a ton. I married my wife at 19yo. We had a single date before we got married (wildly not the norm here). 
So, that's my caveat disclaimer.
But it's better than nothing.
What do you think dating is for?
Well, in my opinion, I think dating is like building a bridge from one side while the other person is building the other half from the opposite side
If you have good chemistry, you go ahead and complete it and both are now a couple. And then after a few months or years, they decide whether they love each other enough to marry
I guess this is what it is.
In case if I haven't told you already, I'm asexual.
Your description of dating I think is a fittingly broad description of [[intimacy]] and any connection seeking empathy, understanding, and the other.
I like that description.
Thank you
So, the ideal goal is to end up with at least one spouse for life for you, yeah? 
I do not know how asexual men are treated in standard dating rituals anywhere. I assume that many people will not be able to accept that.
Actually, I haven't thought a great deal about spouses because I'm mostly terrified of that because I have never dated in my life and that's a huge commitment and I really don't know whether it's something I want to do or not. But maybe if I find someone amazing, I will end up with one spouse or mostly none.
It's hard to date as an Asexual.
Most people would not date me because I'm asexual even though they are interested because most people love having sex but I'm not a guy who's into it.
Yeah, I can see that. You'll have to find someone relatively open and accepting. You might be treated as similar to stereotypical gay friends or a eunuch. 
Well, I think it makes sense to pursue lifelong friendships.
Yep, kind of similar to that
So I currently have this girl but I don't know whether she is into me or not
I'm guessing she is
But I really don't know what to say. We have an amazing chemistry. We've chatted for days till 3 am almost every night for the past week
That is excellent.
We both have a lot of similarities but I'm a person who doesn't really get those 'hints'. That makes it so hard for me.
She understands that you are asexual, right? Where does she think the relationship is going, if you had to guess?
She knows that I'm asexual
If I have to guess, I think she thinks that it's heading towards the right path and so do I.
She's been a really great friend of mine for the past 5 years. She dated many people while I dated none.
For the past 2 years she had sworn off dating because she apparently liked being single.
But at the same time and on the same day, we were debating over something and I made a nice argument and she replied with, "Can I tell you something if you promise that you won't be offended?" And I said "Sure" and she texted back, "While I was reading this, I was so attracted to you"
Sapiosexual/Demisexuality and those who value reason as core to discourse will find you quite attractive. You can have Platonic^^tm^^ relationships that run deep and don't have the same worries that standard sexual practices may have (or at least minimizing them). 
Well, you're right. She claims to be a sapiosexual.
One metaphor that continues to be important in my life is that of the campfire. I have people join me by the fireside for just a few minutes sometimes (strangers passing), some who come by to visit once a year, some who stay for a few months and go, and when I'm ridiculously lucky, I have people committed to staying with me, building our camps together (breaking the metaphor, but even when we must have two camps, I guess we use our magic machines to stay in contact...maybe Palantirs?).
I've faced enough rejection in my life that I'm quite sensitive and paranoid about it. I'm getting used to having friendships that won't run any deeper for various reasons.
Dude.... I use the same thing but with trains. Life is just a train journey and the people you meet in life are the fellow passengers. Some of them might stay for a long time and some might leave early when their destination arrives.

Perfeck, sir.
I never asked someone out so I have never been rejected at all. But I also have zero confidence because I am super scared about the outcome of asking her out.

Thanks! Yours is a nice one but since I have travelled a lot in trains, I guess I will stick with them :)
Perfeck, sir.
How would you want her sexual needs to be fulfilled?
I believe in sex after marriage and so does she. So sex is out of question and we both are just like a couple of people with amazing chemistry and friendship. I guess if she wanted her sexual needs fulfilled, I would partake in it.
I've encountered some long-term and married couples with an asexual partner who is far enough on the asexual spectrum that they don't participate at all (and instead sometimes allow a poly relationship - this doesn't sound like something you'd want).
I think you are in a good position to either not ask at all and allow the friendship to develop organically or be in a position to ask about your shared end (working toward living together, eventually). 
That ask, in a sense, might be a lower commitment (so I think that's interesting). 
Some asexuals like sex, some are neutral, and some totally dislike sex. I think I'm neutral and don't really care about it, but a bit leaning towards sex repulsion.
(there are many norms and social factors I'm extra blind to here, btw...)
My daughter and my wife consider themselves asexual to some degree.
Yeah, maybe a lower commitment to a certain level. Social norms don't okay much of a deal and marriage between us is totally out if question because I'm just 18 now. I don't want to get married so soon. Well, at least until I'm in my late 20s.
Right now, I think friendships are more important to your safety and well-being than dating. 
That's great!! Asexuality is a spectrum. It's really weird and a bit complicated.

That is true.
Right now, I think friendships are more important to your safety and well-being than dating. 
I think one of the difficulties of dating is that if one doesn't want to date anymore, there is a higher risk of the friendship not surviving. 
I see no reason to push for dating when you don't even want the end result for another decade.
Just be friends, enjoy it, eat it up with a spoon, sir.
Hmmm. You are right. I don't really see her as 'marriage material' so breaking up is inevitable. I just want to have some fun for sometime because being lonely is somewhat boring and I want to try out different people and gain experience. I still can't decide whether risking the friendship is worth it.
Have a base of friends as a foundation for support and defeating loneliness. Then you can shoot for higher and still have a safety net. 
(it's important to know that your Dunbar Number expenditures will shift if and when you do get married...so much oxygen and fuel must be spent and focused on a single relationship that sometimes there are zero-sum losses or sacrifices in other relationships)
Sometimes I feel like it is worth it because she is one of my last friends before I move on to another part of my life (college). So wiping the slate clean with that chapter of my life sounds really good. I also don't want to regret not doing it later on in my life. I'm still thinking. I haven't taken a decision yet
Yep, having friends is good. This is one of the reasons that's holding me back

I agree with that. I have seen multiple friendships of mine slowly fading away because they found someone

That is painful. =/
It really is, but I'm used to it. So it's fine.
I'm always on the hunt for commitment. It's hard to do well, and I cannot claim to do it well enough, sir. I'm feeling quite confident about your odds; you keep pushing.
(and, I'm not the optimistic sort, as you know )
You've already found the biggest commitment in life, sir. You have an amazing spouse. As for friendships, you can make a lot of them. I will surely keeping pushing. I am tempted to ask her best friend whether she is into me or not but I don't know whether it is the right thing to do.

Neither am I. I'm not that optimistic either.
By the way, thanks a million for all the advice. It made me realise what I should do. Thanks a lot
`/hug`. I'm glad to listen and to be useful. 
Thank you!
