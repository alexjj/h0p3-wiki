Murmurations of Lens Luxationated Corvids.

Philosophy -> Theology -> Poetry -> Silence. 

Like two mind-readers reading each others' minds, and it's unclear whose mind is being read.

Why would one think that realism implies a materialist outlook? 

I'm pretty sure there are (tiny) organisms that have drowned in my cum. I don't know how I feel about that. It's kinda hawt.

* All sapient daseins have an equal fundamental dignity in virtue of their free will.
* Material inequalities can be solved through effective redistribution mechanisms, including and especially the means of production.
* Moral choice inequalities: even some versions of ourselves are simply better than others (and similarly, that is at least theoretically measurable, even if it requires [[infinigress]]es).

I have heard some roughly say that one of my talents is the ability to walk inside their lives and boop them on the nose.

What do you really mean when you say that in your ideal society there would be "no more poor people"? they/them vs (((they)))/(((them)))

Occam's Razor on emergence: antipleonasmic abstractions, when an event or object is more simply explained by that "an entity is X", rather than "many entities are X", the emergence, an egregore, attains enough internal coherence that it is no longer narratively as useful to decompose it, and the many are //justifiably epistemically// (though not obviously ontologically) subsumed in our energy-efficient perceptual objectification. Now, don't you worry now, that surely can't ever fall prey to rationalization or the kind of sense-making processes used to "justify" actions and behaviors that have already happened, by adopting whatever are the most ~~plausible~~ convenient justifications even though they are inaccurate in some respect. But, of course, we are dependent upon this sense-making to interpret meaning and structure by reducing chaos to (presumably) relevant, digestible details.

Hey you: you are going to have to learn to say "fuck you" and "fuck off" to me (not the irrevocable kind, the kind that's about [[Deconstruction Obligates Reconstruction]]). 

Sometimes, I think I am training wheels (I know you're thinkin': easy old man, if you shake your cane at zoomers any harder your shoulder's gonna pop out!). Or, at least I hope I could be that useful. I have a duty to create something that will help those lonely lost souls out of the same depths of hell I crawled out from. 

Are you feeling homophobiaphobiaphobiaphobic? Sort by controversial and ctrl+f for "coochie" and "felching." Tell me, are you a fan of wincest? Squish me between your boobs and unbirth me, please, mama. I adore being your unhinged retard, btw.

You know that feeling when you meet someone and your heart skips a beat? That's arrhythmia. You can die from that.
