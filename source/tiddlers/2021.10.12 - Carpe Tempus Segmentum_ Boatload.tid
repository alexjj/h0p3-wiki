title: 2021.10.12 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Boatload

Woke at 5:30. Meditation. [[ASK]]ing. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! She's up. Half-shower. She was up late with [[j3d1h]] who will surely hate us both eventually. We made food and coffee. She's in a black and white plaid shirt dress, vest, dark knee-high socks with her boots. y u m. Her day is surprisingly clear looking for now, two life-altering applications due in March, and she's got time to work on them. Many XOXOs, made her 10 minutes late (someone forgot two things this morning, I'm glad I'm there to help). [[Morning Routine]].

[[TTTOTW]]. Finished roast veggies leftovers and melon. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! Pushed bricks. Half-shower. Cleaning. [[TTTOTW]] + Footbath + LolWorlds. It's terrible, I know, but I enjoy the BM emotes at this level. Too many movies to be nostalgic about here.

Sub-20 T1 vs DFM, you love to hear it. Squid Game (Korean advice) Talon with a pet cat riding her magic book (mmm) is hawt. Must be nice. Yeah, push it in. That might have been the worst beating at a Worlds I've ever seen. I don't think anyone can consent to that.

Offspring and I made the meal together. Boys chopped, girl ran the kitchen.

Offspring came down to work. Son's ricing. My daughter is finishing up her Cargo chapter (and, I think it wouldn't hurt to do it again; the initial book is probably one worth knowing backwards and forwards). Dialecture, but she's not bored, thankfully (though, I am absolutely sure, beyond a shadow of any possible doubt, she would deny that she enjoyed any of our conversation). Then we cleaned.

//The Walk// with my offspring was fun until I broke out in a cold sweat with a boatload of anxiety out of nowhere. Sat down for a minute before we continued. Son had us talk about PTSD, and we discussed a wide variety of topics. He's got good intuitions about it. Daughter had us talk about [[Rust]] and many tangents. They didn't do a good job on their schoolwork.

I finished off dinner while the family had their study session. Food. [[TTTOTW]]. 

[[Family Gathering]] was excellent. I had 5 bowls of lentil soup tonight. Lol! Why don't we have this more often again? Holy god, I love this stuff. My wife was going back through stuff we used to enjoy making that we haven't made in a while.

Son and I watched another snippet of //Bad Grandpa// until we hit the stripper scene. Best for last, of course. Too much. I'm glad he doesn't mind watching in fragments. [[TTTOTW]].

She came as promised. //Squid Game// + //Raw Skintime//. The show is awful. The writing is horrific. I'm glad to watch it, especially with that body on mine. =). 

[[TTTOTW]]. [[ASK]]ing. Sleep by 10?
