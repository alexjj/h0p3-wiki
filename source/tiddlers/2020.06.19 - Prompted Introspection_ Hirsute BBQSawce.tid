!! Tell about a time you held hands with someone.

[[2019.04.09 - Prompted Introspection: Handholding First]] is the wrong question. Holding hands is important to me, [[2019.12.12 - Prompted Introspection: Eww My Wew]]. I think the older I get, the more important holding hands feels to me.

Beware, I'm a sweater (as in, I sweat a lot, but...I'm also ridiculously ~~good-looking~~ hairy to the point that one can realistically describe me as wearing a mansweater) too. By the time you are done holding my awkward hand, my hair and sweat will have slathered your hand. Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention that my sweat also tends to have the peculiar stench tied to post-redigesting anything I've consumed in the past day or two (sometimes even months if it is fat soluble). What I'm saying is: everyone really enjoys holding hands and handing holds with me, and they never regret it. Victims of holding my hand are cursed with only being able to tell the terrifying story in fragments.

I held my grandma's hand ([[2018.08.16 - Prompted Introspection: Speaker For The Dead]] and [[2020.03.19 - Prompted Introspection: Nana]] capture some of the context here) when I said goodbye to her for the last time. Holding any of my grandmothers' hands have been unique tactile experiences. I think they are like physical markers for me to remember the sensation of. I know that too while I'm holding someone's hand. I like the idea that we are unified for however and to whatever [[dok]] we can be.
