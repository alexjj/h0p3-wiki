Drop 'em out
Let me see them titties
Gonna take a long look at those tig 'ol bitties
Areolas lookin' nice, nipples lookin' real pretty
Come on let me gander at your boobs

Drop 'em out
Let me see them knockers
Gonna take a long look at those big ham hockers
Just squeeze 'em together while I play with my cocker
Come on let me gander at your boobs

Drop 'em out
Let me see them flabbies
Bounce 'em up
Make an old man happy
Smack 'em around
Just lay 'em on my lappie
Come on
Let me jism on your boobs

Drop 'em out
Let me see them titties
Gonna take a long look at those tig 'ol bitties
Areolas lookin' nice, nipples lookin' real pretty
Come on let me gander at your boobs

Drop 'em out
Let me see them knockers
Gonna take a long look at those big ham hockers
Just squeeze 'em together while I play with my cocker
Come on let me gander at your boobs

Drop 'em out
Bounce 'em up
Smack 'em around
Boobs

Drop 'em out
Let me see them titties
Gonna take a long look at those tig 'ol bitties
Areolas lookin' nice, nipples lookin' real pretty
Come on let me gander at your boobs

Drop 'em out
Let me see them knockers
Gonna take a long look at those big ham hockers
Just squeeze 'em together while I play with my cocker
Come on let me gander at your boobs
