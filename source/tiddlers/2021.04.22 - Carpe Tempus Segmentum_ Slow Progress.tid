title: 2021.04.22 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Slow Progress

Probably woke at 4ish. Meditation, Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Bugged her until she dismissed me, came back though. That's what I do. =). Woke offspring, assignments. My daughter was unpleasant this morning. I know how it do. Prepped for dinner.

[[TTTOTW]]. Good news on DMV front. $300/y for continuing to insure the vehicle we won't need. Will eventually let it go. Made some food, hugged [[Scout]] as he went to the interview. He seemed to have his shields up and ready to rock. 

A game with my son. My opening hand: Clamp, Austere, SFM, Elspeth, 3 lands. He hung right in there though, maybe 20 turn game, Reiterating my Bribery to take my Terastadon to stabilize the game, topdecking his Gisela, and almost had enough to get there (Elixiring my Austere back into the deck, digging deep with Brainstorm, ACall, Clamping to find it, but I ended up not needing it). Epic game.

Hung some pictures. My wife doesn't want her old portrait anymore. Too something. I'm going to keep it. =). I used to think that, but now it's a piece of history for me.

[[TTTOTW]]. Called up another tire center. I just want used tires people. Plz. Phone tag, eventually be told they won't even give me an estimate for new tires. Broski checked around on FB for used tires, but the set we need are rare. =/.  

Would like to have a single roll of the insulation before I buy a pallet. I really need a good ladder, foam/caulking prep, and one of those staplers you slap with instead of pull the trigger on. Considering going for the more expensive stuff for the Attic. 

[[JRE]] called. Knot from daycare on head. Taking [[Q]] to the doctor. [[Rb]] is feeling healed. Talked about insulation, worry about how the house kept cool. He felt bad for upsetting [[AIR]]. I'm staying out of it too. I think that makes sense. I've noticed my brother [[AIR]] has a quiet and thoughtful approach to dealing with his feelings (this is the second time in week I've seen it); god damn is that an expensive to thing to have developed. [[JRE]] prefers Aluminum factory position (emergency patching job) or the powerplant to the position he's going to have. 

Continuing to make sure that kitchen is set. So hard to keep it clean. Offspring aren't proud of themselves, and it's not up to me. They hear what I think, and that's enough.

Played a game with my daughter. Smashed. She hates her deck. Maybe our "chaos" draft didn't work well. We need to go back, slow it down.

[[TTTOTW]], and then I couldn't stay awake. Duty calls.

Woke to her jumping into my bed. Inform the Men! Eternity ended. Fell asleep again, like a useless male, ofc. I was woken for food.

[[Family Gathering]] sans [[Scout]], sadly. We had a good time. I asked who was proud of their work for the day, one by one. We listened to my wife speak about her work. 

My son played another with me. He stood his ground against waves of bombs. Clever work, and in the end, his T2 Claim on Elixir (a mistake, imho) turned out to provide him the victory as I couldn't seal the game in 7 turns (despite the overwhelming board presence) against his pulsing. Very well done. Many would have scooped long before. I think his deck is better than it looks, but I think his play is what really shines. 

Nap in lap. Like a truck, sleep is hitting. I'm [[grateful]].
