title: 2021.01.11 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Heavy

* [[Letter]]-writing
* Chilled with [[k0sh3k]]
** I say 80% sleep. She had energy, swatted me a lot. =)
* Pizza + //House of Cards//
* Woke at 4:30
* Sounds like my daughter has been working, my son not so much.
* [[Morning Routine]] sans Fireman Time.
* Try To Take Over The World
* Chilled with [[k0sh3k]], almost went on a walk, but //Skintime// and good argumentation generated a much better option:
* Inform the Men!
** Slow, more talkative than usual. Heaven. Even for a computer-lubbin retard like me, there is no substitute for human warmth.
** I love to hear her breathe. I rarely go on top (I want to be smothered, not the other way around [though I want to swallow her entirely...it's not coherent, but okay]), but when I am: she has a hard time catching her breath. always hawt.
** Pure greed today will require healing, sadly. Sorry future [[h0p3]]. 
* Meditation
* [[Miss Direction]] snapped her towel dead-on, and I fell to my knees in pain. 
* Shower of the gods!
** I have a little hook in her room for my towel now. I've minimized the space I take up in her life to the bare minimum convenience. She's gonna be all set, I think.
*** A drawer for stuff, a nightstand for the goodies, my ethernet wire, and a towel. 
*** Makes me smile to see that desk instantly filled with stuff. That is her through and through (and she gets shit done too). It's piling up from the floor and on the desk. We'll take a few more passes at it. The rest of the room has so much breathing space. That is what wealth feels like. I am [[grateful]] that she has a place to be.
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Pizza rolls, veggie platter, water
** Mirthful, I wandered while we were there. 
** [[MTG]]
*** Daughter's Affinity vs Wife's Thresh: I liked their moves, PoP and Plating each take down a game. 
*** Son's MUC vs Goblins: Caverns pushes piledriver combo into play before he could stabilize; Lackey->Kiki, EoT->Kiki, Kiki again, triple lackey, but still lose because no gas against shackles, shackles, stone; Vial+Caverns, Double lackey trigger->Matron->Kiki->Matron, gg.
* Wife read, nap in lap, 9:30
