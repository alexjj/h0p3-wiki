title: 2020.07.08 - Prompted Introspection: Zealotry

!! Tell about how your parents influenced your spiritual beliefs.

[[2019.06.30 - Prompted Introspection: Spiritual Beliefs]] is sadly sparse. I don't avoid the question, but I hardly connect the dots. This is probably a question I'll need to keep painfully trying to answer. I'm unbearable to almost all people on this matter. You have to be pretty secure to stand up to me here.

I have every ounce of their zealotry. =).

I have inherited the worship of truth. At least in the vein of their own religion, my donors are highly educated and practical, and they taught me how to study with a [[Straussian]] mindset.<<ref "t">> Paranoic steelmanning is expensive. Nobody can know it all, of course. It is rare that I meet anyone who can make inferences beyond an undergrad Youtube-remix summary perspective of their own religious beliefs (let alone others). Most my age and younger aim to eschew claiming they are religious even (which I think is hilarious, at best), and the sociology of belief is something I share with my donors to some degree. They substantially downplay their knowledge because it is almost completely irrelevant to the people they interact with. I'm grateful that they pointed me to systematic lifelong study of what matters most. It's awfully hard, and I can't claim to do it well enough. I appreciate their literacy too (it's fundamental to how they shape themselves). I have yet to meet anyone with a library as large as my female donor's; the woman reads like the wind.<<ref "o">>

They have been correct in their assessment of postmodernity and egoism to a non-trivial degree. They are correct: most people are garbage on this front. I don't think my donors escape their own criticism terribly well, but I can appreciate the goal of integrity (de-laced of some hollow Biblicisms) they claim to pursue. 

It makes our relationship all the more complicated that some of the core beliefs and many strands of Christianity^^tm^^ are syncreticisms (and universals) with profound merit. Anyone who thinks Christianity is easy to attack isn't even remotely trying to attack a steelman.<<ref "a">> I say that as someone who is happy to push a button to delete the right 97% of the people who claim to be Christian (and otherwise). That perspective is heavily influenced by their beliefs too.

Parts of them have sacrificially given a shit about the suffering of people to a radical extent. That I hold in high regard.
