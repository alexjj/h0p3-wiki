title: 2022.04.21 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Spring Cleaning

Woke at 4. //Skintime// with my sympaticon + planning + [[Morning Routine]]. 

Breakfast with mi amor. I stole sips of her coffee just 'cause. Next two months are a serious push, and she was asked to do another conference forum for her work on staff training (beyond the consulting she's been doing for other libraries both within her own University and out).<<ref "l">>

[[D2]]. Chad the WW-Baba (previously frenzy) was rushed through all of hell, 75. Grief is strong. May make a second if I don't go Beast.

[[TTTOTW]]. Speaking with robot-writer [[anon]]s and [[HighFlyer]]. A wild [[stonedagain]] appears...

Solar is an odd mix of companies and affiliates. SunPower appears the best option, and now we're working through two others, one of which is a local installer. Almost into the process itself.

Shopping @ Home Depot with my sympaticon. Looked at all the plants outside. I measured out the sheds for the possibility we will have one, eventually (we could use it). Picked up 20 slabs of concrete and some mulch (which is what we'll use to set up the area where our planters will grow). 

[[D2]] respeccing. I've gone with a hybrid WW/Frenzy build. Every melee needs an AoE ability, despite how strong they are at single target damage otherwise (the ability to tank'n'spank while rapidly applying CB is the deepest strength they have, in the long-run). I believe Chad is now 81, and `/players 8` is doable with some hiccups still. I'm having a hard time seeing it being better than either the kicker or smiter, as he drops to next to nothing too consistently. Went angelic set to pick up enough AR. Not much to him: pre-buff, WW the crowds, Frenzy the singleton baddies (maybe Concentrate is better, but I don't see it). I know why people don't like hybrids here, but I'm not convinced that going without WW is worthy given its special properties.

Assignments. My daughter sanded and primed the front door with a couple coats. Found out that the handle has been painted, and we like what is underneath. She wasn't happy gettin' started, but she quickly became pleasant if not even pleased with her efforts by the end. `/thumbs-up`. It's good to hear her opinion about matching colors together. I don't think she knows (cognitively to some degree, but she lacks experience) what the door means to her mother. <3.

Vapelyfe. [[ASK]], [[1uxb0x]], and I worked downstairs. Garage and tool area have been cleaned and organized. SHTF (and hopefully brighter times too*) bikes stowed under the stairs. [[ASK]] made a makeshift table for a workspace in the garage (we've needed it multiple times, and it's already put to good use) from the spare wood from the crate used to ship her motorcycle, and that's where we are headed with that space. She regularly has good, practical ideas using the materials we have at hand.

I built out most of the staircase, and my son gophered and moved heavy objects where they belonged. Eventually, we practiced measuring and cutting the concrete slabs (he had fun, and felt excellent by the end). Eventually, my son added some stairs too, and he finished off the job, including cleanup.

[[ASK]] and I planned more for the backyard. It will be many years before it becomes what we [[hope]] for, I think. That's alright by me.

My son and I dismantled the old toilet (saved the tank, as it would make for a cool flower pot), and broke the lower piece inside of nested trashbags. He was clever about getting the bag into the trash can too. Speaking of which, our shop needs one of the Brute cylindrical trash cans some day (yet another good idea of my sympaticon's). 

Prep for dinner. Cleaning with my son. He was happy. =)

Mi amor came home feeling quite weird. 32 shots, and some now in her shoulders.<<ref "g">> She was kinda itchy all over, didn't want anything, not even cloth, touching her skin. Overwhelmed and maybe anxious. 

//The Walk// with mi amor. Short route. I was surprised she was up for walking. She appears to be successfully lobbying for open access changes for thesis and dissertation archives. The committee isn't even going to ask, they'll just say that's how it's going to be done. `/nod`. Bougie AF, she gets a use it or lose it $2500 a year for conferences alone (some of it earmarked for only up to two conferences in meatspace), so we're thinking about how to spend that wisely. Bootstrapping into another position, an original goal from decades ago (and, I like how we [[hope]]fully* will get there too<<ref "i">>). We're going to continue to push for FLOSS, decentralized, open access infrastructures across the board, built for all universities, not just this fancy bullshit. We can do it with some of our tools already, but we need a lot of help to replace what they've got (I am not optimistic, but we must do our best).

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

[[Family Gathering]] was chill. [[5c0ut]] talked about his job, workin' with boomers. The mute seemed pretty interesting. We had brats with potatoes, and water for me. I had two plates. Couch-bed was super useful.

ESS-EM-ESS with Elaine. She's all bubbles.

Last hugs goodnight. Fell asleep pretty quickly thereafter. Maybe sleep by 9?
