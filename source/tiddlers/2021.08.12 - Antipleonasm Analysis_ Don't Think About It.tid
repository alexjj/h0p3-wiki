Things become complicated only when we think about them.

no u. retard. 

Beware the Zen-Orwellian thought-terminators, especially those that hide themselves in self-application. That's awfully close to the short-circuiting rhetoric of a con-artist (e.g. a mentalist). Insofar as this claim is a blanket pacifying nudge or hypnotic exhortation to not think so much in general, it's not permissible. Dasein has a telos.

Of course, things-in-themselves were already infinitely complicated whether any of us existed to think of them or not. They become complicated for us as we uncover their complications, in part through some types of thinking about them.<<ref "t">> I will even agree that the identity (though less so the essence) of a thing becomes more complex (the state of affairs includes more facts [uncountable is uncountable, I realize] about that thing in relation to one's mind)<<ref "c">> as it is thought about, including in representation.<<ref "i">> 

There's nothing necessarily wrong with complexity nor in thinking about it. It can be a source of anxiety, but that too isn't necessarily wrong (in fact, it's obligated in many contexts). Yeah, stop thinking about what's causing you anxiety, and you won't feel anxiety. You don't have the right to not feel anxiety in many contexts. This is self-soothing without paying the price for self-regulation in a world in which we do not own the rights to our minds to do just anything. The egoist seeks to lie to themselves, the unjustified complication they really don't want to think about.

The notion that we ought to attempt to live permanently in the ready-to-hand mode is beyond misguided. [[Meditative|Theories of Meditation]] practices that seek to limit our discovery of what matters aren't justified. I do, of course, appreciate the desire to be a hedonically satisfied NPC reduced to an observer bouncing around in an experience machine reduced to a mere nihilistic illusory game of "just vacuously moving stuff around" and where the points really don't matter, of course, [[cypher]]. Stop talking crazy, foo.
