title: 2020.05.03 - Family Log: Fungus in your bungus

!! Write a paragraph summarizing each person's week given the wikis:

** 1uxb0x
*** I think my week has been full of ups and downs. I think my best logs were the earlist logs. I think I might dip soon again, considering I have been getting worse for my logs in many respects. I've been making stuff independantly much more. Overall I think my wiki was okay.
** j3d1h
*** "A halfmooned promise" is very interesting! You should fill it out more - I don't think I've seen you write many poems. Your presentations are getting much cleaner. I think you should lean away from the talking point style. You tend to pause a lot that way, and it feels a little like bad improv. It's a skill you should develop, but until you get there, you should write fuller sentences in your notes. :P
** k0sh3k
*** You need to be careful about when you should use apostrophes (possessive) and when you shouldn't use apostrophes (possessive); you tend to get those confused. Your prompted introspection on toilet paper is excellent and funny - thank you. In fact, you have a few really funny lines in your wiki this week, and I love them all. On your astronaut thought-experiment, remember that one needs to be first-person, one should be second-person, and one should be third-person. Speaking of the astronaut thought-experiment, don't listen to your dad; you should not troll your sister in your stories. For your report on Shelley's job, you might want to mention what the job is (right-of-way agent).

*** [[1uxb0x]] has clearly been thinking about geopolitics, history, and moral philosophy. His pre-writing continues to improve, and he's consistently delivering improving drafts; he's killing it. We are lucky that he is comfortable crying with us. He's going to work on tagging and naming for his old fool. He's been increasingly humorous lately (like: [[2020.04.29 – Prompted Introspection: Over or under]], including zinging [[h0p3]] over the wikis, and that's wonderful. Some days are really hard for him, and he keeps going. He continues to improve upon the subpractices and overall practice of [[Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση]]; he makes progress in delivering fit presentations and leading dialectics in our classroom. He's been working on a script to munge through `.tid` files. It appears he may be cultivating an interest in the garden. He video interviewed an agent of the state working on eminent domain negotiation and enforcement. It's been a heckuva week for and with him.

*** It's scary that you passed out this week, you should have that in your logs. I think you should make sure to have a hand on the stair guardrails at all times, in case that happens and you can't sit down. I fear you aren't doing enough on TLT. I think you're evil for puting waffle and ketchup together. Overall an okay week for you.
** j3d1h
*** This week was very stressful, but I also got a lot done. With any luck, I'll be buying the laptop tomorrow. Without it, I should make a backup plan - non-auction laptop as well? I need to be better about finishing life logs. The astronaut thought experiment is going to be very fun.
** k0sh3k
*** I like seeing when one thing you're learning (like about hedonic adaptation) finds a connection to something else you're doing (antipleonasm analysis); you'll find that happens a lot, and I hope you start to notice it yourself more often. Also, no one should ever dip waffles in ketchup that's gross. "uh" I would really like to see the things I require for your life logs actually in your life logs. Often your prompted introspections align very neatly with your antipleosasm analyses; I assume it's not coincidental. What is your process for picking the topic, question, and quote? I'm excited about next semester; I hope you are, too.
** h0p3
*** [[j3d1h]] basically passed out this week, and we were lucky to be able to hear from a doctor. She has verified that her laptop's hardware must be replaced. She did a good job in the interview; it was almost clinical. Her [[title.Title]]'s are growing beautifully Tumblrina-esque, [[2020.05.02 - YTDL: Purghaps]]; hopefully, she'll write a [[title.Title]] for all of her logs whether it's clever or not. She's had some major highs and lows this week. She's been a bright character too.

** 1uxb0x
*** It feels like you have two versions of the RCL [[Chapter 18 - "Proclaiming the Good News of the Kingdom"]] and your RCL. I really like [[Chapter 18 - "Proclaiming the Good News of the Kingdom"]]. I also really like your RCL. Thank you for having our school stuff in your wiki. Overall you've had a good week.
** j3d1h
*** Your wiki is less active this week than last, I think. It's still got a lot. Thank you for helping me with my school. I liked your longer prompted introspections. Please don't pan fry me.
** k0sh3k
*** I really did enjoy GISH; I think I'll do the next mini-Hunt, too. I might try to build my own team and be a captain, lol. I did not do as much work this past week on my Canvas course as I probably should have; I'm just feeling a little burned out on it. I think I'll do one more assignment and quiz, and then ask student workers to review it and make comments about what should be added/changed. I really do need to put more fruit in my ice cream; if I cut down the amount of ice cream and replace it with berries, that makes it healthy, right? I don't know whether taking iron has helped or not, really. 
** h0p3
*** [[k0sh3k]] has been getting to bed on time, and I'm glad. She's needed the sleep; I can feel her tiredness. She's eaten like a queen this week, and even k0shiqua may have a safe and satiating space. [[k0sh3k]] is eventually going to head back to work on site (since her job is frontline and necessary for the rest of the university to begin functioning in full). This has required lots of projection and steering perspectives+ideas through committees, exhausting for her. For the rest of us, it's also made us reckon with just how much we're going to miss having her in the house (working remotely); she is a blessing to us all. I'm not ready for her to go; it's such a rare treat in my life to be able to work alongside my spouse. [[Chapter 18 - "Proclaiming the Good News of the Kingdom"]] was excellent, as usual. She's been designing solid curriculum pathing with her offspring, and she continues to build core processes in their lives.

*** I find that you have been getting larger title.titles.  I like how you want to help me with my terrible jokes, an example of the terrible joke statment is Manual breathing. I find that we are making alot of TTP's. I actually think we are making too many, I accidentally made two of the same kind. Overall, a pretty good week of work.
** j3d1h
*** Your wiki is far too much, as always. I blame it on you that I just started semi-manually breathing. 2020 has been awful, I agree. You seem to be writing more letters to people you don't know well. Is there a specific reason for that?
** k0sh3k
*** My grandmother really was an amazing woman. She was also very snarky at times, and could make sly zingers with a sweet smile on her face. I'm glad the brats didn't make you sick this time. I don't think we need to worry so much about games distracting us from family conversations; we tend to converse a lot, so I don't think we're losing anything. I like your font button; that helps. The non-monospace is my fav, of course. That said, it does fuck up your ascii art a tad. It's sort of sad that your new bedtime goal is "by 2am." You  need to get a human sleep schedule. While you're developing good habits, learn to brush your teeth as often as you masturbate. When you die, I or the kids will put your last words up on a tiddler just called "Eye Bee Deed." 
** h0p3
*** [[h0p3]] averaged a good week. He received two "Out of the Red" messages this week, and that was a pleasant surprise. [[FTO]] continues to be a key force in his life. Walking, talking, reading, writing, and watching comprise most of his days. He's aimed to [[BAGD]], and it has been expensive (surprise! :P). He's been working on his [[Kintsugi]], and it's lookin' decent enough (still trying to figure it out).
