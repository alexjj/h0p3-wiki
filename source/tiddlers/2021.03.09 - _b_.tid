I'm not naive enough to not recognize the prime facie force of the claim that 'revolutions never work, because the inevitable power vacuum it creates only rewards the most power hungry, violent, and amoral components of that revolution.' //Never// is a poor word choice. It's possible to prevent this. A justified revolution not only overthrows existing power but transforms the public's understanding of the fitting descriptions and prescriptions of existing societal relations. Of course revolution is more likely to be successful if the people have a lot of experience in self-government and politics at the local level. [[Deconstruction Obligates Reconstruction]].
