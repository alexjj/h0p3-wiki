!! How have credit cards affected your life?

[[2019.06.25 - Prompted Introspection: Credit Card Effects]] and [[2017.11.11 - Prompted Introspection Log: Credit Card]] capture a simple semblance of my history and thoughts on the matter. There's a lot to say about how the credit industry has shaped human history, including my own life. 

The situation has changed in the past year. I couldn't have moved without credit. Two cards with $500 limits, one visa, one master. My wife keeps both (essentially started in her name, relying upon her social citizen rating; her name is the only one that matters on this front), and I have two in virtue of hers. My daughter keeps one, and I keep the other (my son gave it back). Autopays are set. We buy groceries with them when we use them. They sit there.

Perhaps we should continue to ramp it up. One every 3 months? It's not a matter of discipline but of safety.
