[21.08.21 - 20:30:47] * A_Smith waves to _riley_ , ben999[m] , BilliePi , coniptor , Dude[m]1 , Jaxx , Lord_XetroV , MatrixTravelerbot[m] , Peppaq , Peuc , r00tobo , t3chn0 ufo-piloot , catman , [[h0p3]] , qwer and zbychuk7 , how are ya's ??
[21.08.21 - 20:41:49] [[ASmith]]: Rev Jessie Jackson and his Wife just checked into a regional hospital for Covid19, both recieved a Covid19 vaccine in January of this year
[21.08.21 - 20:42:16] [[ASmith]]: breakthrough case, jackson is 79yrs old, his wife is 77
[21.08.21 - 20:43:18] [[ASmith]]: good to hear riley, thanks for responding
[21.08.21 - 20:43:52] [[ASmith]]: I'm laying out the ground work for the vertical stacking planters in the garden lower-40
[21.08.21 - 20:44:34] [[ASmith]]: drove out to home depot to pick up sections of 1" and 1 1/2" PVC pipe to hold and secure the vertical planters
[21.08.21 - 20:46:00] [[h0p3]]: I'm doing alright. Still curled-up hard, and today has been a lazy Saturday (that's been nice).
[21.08.21 - 20:46:19] [[ASmith]]: Rows will consistant of 7 vertical planters spaced 3 feet apart 21-24 feet across, 6 feet tall using 2' of 1 1/2" PVC pipe in the ground with a 5' 1" PVC pipe riser to hold the 7 tier 4 pedal vertical stacking planters each
[21.08.21 - 20:46:36] [[ASmith]]: oh, blue collar efforts there [[h0p3]] ?
[21.08.21 - 20:47:34] [[h0p3]]: Not much lately. Dad and vocational efforts mostly.
[21.08.21 - 20:48:32] [[ASmith]]: I see, I put together 12 twenty gallon grow bags on used tires to try and expand the garden production here, 7 are for potatos alone
[21.08.21 - 20:48:54] [[h0p3]]: It's been a good use of those old tires that cost too much to recycle.
[21.08.21 - 20:48:57] [[ASmith]]: 2 bunching onions, 2 kalidiscope carrots, 1 various mint plants
[21.08.21 - 20:49:20] [[ASmith]]: yeah, I don't think the kid cared about dumping those in my backyard but I put them to good use
[21.08.21 - 20:50:06] [[ASmith]]: I picked up 5 more 20 gallon grow bags for more potatos, those with 300 Weight cloth, heavy-duty
[21.08.21 - 20:51:04] [[ASmith]]: I'll try cherry tomatos, peppers, lettuce, perhaps some salad greens in the vertical planters starting in spring 2022
[21.08.21 - 20:52:07] [[h0p3]]: You all set for water?
[21.08.21 - 20:52:22] [[ASmith]]: each vertical planter is equal to a garden dirt row of 30 feet with plants 1 foot apart in the ground. 4 rows of those vertical planters = 28 of them = 28 thirty foot rows of plants via those alone
[21.08.21 - 20:52:50] [[ASmith]]: somewhat I'm mostly manually watering but moving to the older style of recycled rubberized soaker hoses
[21.08.21 - 20:53:13] [[ASmith]]: 10 min with a soaker hose concentrates the water exactly where you want it
[21.08.21 - 20:54:23] [[h0p3]]: I like how you build incrementally. It's a sane way to do it.
[21.08.21 - 20:55:39] [[ASmith]]: thanks, the test garden uses a single rainbird up about 7 feet on a post to water the entire garden and a non-existant parallel garden next to it if I want, that area I am working on for the fall planting
[21.08.21 - 20:56:13] [[ASmith]]: the test garden is about 30x35
[21.08.21 - 20:56:35] [[ASmith]]: the parallel garden next to it is about 25x25
[21.08.21 - 20:57:47] [[ASmith]]: I've never run into bind weed there previously, this year its deadly on the vegtables and a headache for its invasive nature, I'll add weed barriers and actively go after it next year [[h0p3]] 
[21.08.21 - 20:59:00] [[h0p3]]: Saw a very expensive robot that would automatically weed a field with something like lasers. 
[21.08.21 - 20:59:08] [[ASmith]]: I'll push what I can into a survival series on Tascloud.me for others that are interested in growing their own veggies or working towards sustainable living 
[21.08.21 - 20:59:41] [[ASmith]]: cool, yep a co2 laser could do it, a diesel flame thrower would likely do also ;)
[21.08.21 - 21:00:29] [[ASmith]]: 20 watt IR lasers are not all that expensive but would burn the seat of the pants of a bystander some 50 yrds away
[21.08.21 - 21:06:45] [[ASmith]]: This year has been a test of a survival garden, however with the learning curve its good to see what works and attempt various gardening methods to maximize the garden production and produce using multiple methods
[21.08.21 - 21:07:13] [[h0p3]]: I could imagine that your process will continue to evolve for years to come. 
[21.08.21 - 21:07:16] [[ASmith]]: square foot gardening, vertical stacking planters for vertical growing methods, raised beds
[21.08.21 - 21:07:45] [[ASmith]]: I figure there's perhaps 2 yrs to figure it out [[h0p3]] , then they'll be a real need for this
[21.08.21 - 21:09:06] [[ASmith]]: madmax = pickup, loadup your vehicle and head to ? getting fuel from ?, or hunker down and ?
[21.08.21 - 21:09:44] [[h0p3]]: My wife says that if it got that bad, she'd rather just die.
[21.08.21 - 21:10:14] [[ASmith]]: Yes, there's the Movie with Gregory Peck, 'On the Beach' which depicts that exactly [[h0p3]] 
[21.08.21 - 21:10:41] [[ASmith]]: although I don't understand why they didn't merely keep in the Navy Sub they used for recon
[21.08.21 - 21:11:06] [[h0p3]]: Thank you. I will make sure she considers the film. 
[21.08.21 - 21:11:23] [[h0p3]]: Who knows what we'll watch tomorrow. =).
[21.08.21 - 21:11:25] [[ASmith]]: its a tough dose of reality to be sure [[h0p3]] 
[21.08.21 - 21:12:08] [[ASmith]]: my goal by next year is a archive of 100,000 moves to go along with my 1,000,000 music singles
[21.08.21 - 21:12:32] [[ASmith]]: I'm closing in on 80,000 movies currently, another 20,000 to go on that goal
[21.08.21 - 21:15:15] [[h0p3]]: If you don't have one, could I send you an invite to myanonamouse for audiobooks? That may be useful to continuing to build out the Library of Alexandria. (very easy to ramp up infinite buffer; I wager you could acquire their full collection in less than two months)
[21.08.21 - 21:16:06] [[h0p3]]: (I'm not a fan of private trackers, but I don't have an alternative to this one)
[21.08.21 - 21:16:21] [[ASmith]]: Its disappointing the christian leaders ordered the destruction of the mayan's science of time cycles taught to them by some jesus figure that gave them all manner of mathematics and other sciences, Quetzalc√≥atl was the god of winds and rain, and the creator of the world and humanity.
[21.08.21 - 21:17:02] [[ASmith]]: ok, doesn't hurt for me to at least look [[h0p3]] 
[21.08.21 - 21:18:28] [[ASmith]]: Quetzalcoatl was white skinned, left by the ocean, stated he'd return. On some anniversary of his leaving and teachings, the Spanard Cortez arrived, Mayans big mistake was to not eliminate him and his men immediately
[21.08.21 - 21:19:25] [[ASmith]]: Its likely the time cycle of the Mayans indicated the direct opposite of Quetzalcoatl would arrive on that date at that location
[21.08.21 - 21:19:35] [[h0p3]]: I need an e-mail address for them to deliver the invite to. Might be best to DM that (also on Tox with ya).
[21.08.21 - 21:19:58] [[ASmith]]: Cortez brought diseases, death, mass destruction and killed the Mayan leaders
[21.08.21 - 21:20:31] [[h0p3]]: My son has been wrestling with me about that exact topic this week on our walks (he's also quite interested in permaculture).
[21.08.21 - 21:21:17] [[ASmith]]: well if the big box grocerys get shut down and in emergencys, they'll be emptied and closed down in 1 week or less
[21.08.21 - 21:21:52] [[ASmith]]: many metro or urban familys do not have the means to have sustainable living in their back yards alone
[21.08.21 - 21:22:12] [[ASmith]]: the few forested areas would quickly be over hunted and staked out by heavily armed groups
[21.08.21 - 21:22:38] [[ASmith]]: organic veggies are by far the best for health and taste
[21.08.21 - 21:22:52] [[ASmith]]: what is your handle on my tox?
[21.08.21 - 21:24:03] [[ASmith]]: got it, thanks
[21.08.21 - 21:24:23] [[ASmith]]: have you tried adding richocet relieved also [[h0p3]] ?
[21.08.21 - 21:25:03] [[ASmith]]: #ricochet-ASmith
[21.08.21 - 21:25:04] TAS_Helpbot ricochet-ASmith is ASmiths Ricochet Refresh P2P Tor ID key to exchange ricochet:6xnggokp7l6sx3mellsfbc4ebkz3qomyxnftp7el32szvow7b5jryfid
[21.08.21 - 21:25:27] TAS_Helpbot ricochet-github is The Ricochet-Refresh github site is located at this link https://github.com/blueprint-freespeech/ricochet-refresh
[21.08.21 - 21:26:00] [[h0p3]]: The original and the refresh. If there was a darkmode (I'm not sure how to enforce it on my system), I would keep it up. Burns my eyes. 
[21.08.21 - 21:26:15] [[h0p3]]: Sent, btw.
[21.08.21 - 21:26:20] [[ASmith]]: k, ty
[21.08.21 - 21:26:56] [[ASmith]]: well I used the original ricochet and was sad to see it go away, however the refresh perhaps has a better chance to add on more capabilitys like tox did
[21.08.21 - 21:28:28] [[ASmith]]: with v3 Onions a requirement now, older tor websites, utilitys, apps are dropping out because their original developers are gone now and there's no one to update them for the new Tor version and heavier encryption
[21.08.21 - 21:30:24] [[ASmith]]: I need to get out to the garden area and start using a new 2" x 12" power augar to drill holes for the seven 1 1/2 PVC pipe uprights for the vertical planters to stand on
[21.08.21 - 21:41:26] [[ASmith]]: any MorpheusB siteings lately?
[21.08.21 - 21:42:12] [[ASmith]]: I hope that Aussie is alright, there's been alot of unrest across Australia over the Covid19 lack of vaccinations and the way they were trotted out
[21.08.21 - 21:44:47] PiB-4-8ormal nope, have'nt seen him in a while...
[21.08.21 - 21:47:26] PiB-4-8ormal have'nt seen fellasgnu either since you booted him one night..  really pissed him off..
[21.08.21 - 21:53:26] [[ASmith]]: oh, he posted someone trading a blowjob for food video, he deserved being kicked 
[21.08.21 - 21:54:12] [[ASmith]]: he's returned, perhaps you don't recall chatting with fellasgnu since then?

Oh, I haven't seen [[Tjandamurra]] in a long time. I don't know what's up. 

I was surprised by that kick, btw. I saw it, but didn't say anything (as usual). That one has trolled pretty hard more than once.

<br>

[21:23:10] h0p3: It's me, [[h0p3]]
[21:23:32] ASmith: you can send it to [[REDACTED@gmailc.com]]
[21:23:38] ASmith: thanks
[21:23:52] ASmith: you can send it to [[REDACTED]]@gmail.com
[21:30:38] ASmith: I need to get out to the garden area and start using a new 2" x 12" power augar to drill holes for the seven 1 1/2 PVC pipe uprights for the vertical planters to stand on
[21:31:24] h0p3: I'm watching both. Happy to have the conversation anywhere.*
[21:31:42] h0p3: Can't add anything for some reason on my refresh just yet. 
[21:32:11] h0p3: Was checkin' out if my site was still up hwikiea2zykn5hdkmf4srti5gglqv5gspqt37opxnhtjdvureonvjoyd.onion 
[21:32:12] ASmith: you need to type in a nicname into the name field
[21:33:22] ASmith: I left a issue for the ricochet refresh developers to deal with that issue. Seems rather silly to hang the addition for intuitive users figuing out you must add a nicname to the name field before the add button is activated
[21:33:47] h0p3: Yeah, that's not even working for me. Lol. 
[21:33:58] h0p3: Let me see if I have the latest version.
[21:34:59] h0p3: Yup, on 3.0.10.
[21:35:16] h0p3: ricochet:qixm2fksyp5aopdkzk7n5hdbrfxqrv2uxmv6ysnxedu5yquifqg7tcyd
[21:35:51] ASmith: I fired up my tor browser, sez problem loading in the link you posted
[21:36:51] ASmith: ricochet:6xnggokp7l6sx3mellsfbc4ebkz3qomyxnftp7el32szvow7b5jryfid
[21:37:24] ASmith: Onionsite Not Found, http://tykpso4p6mw3szydivsdo3hhvriqsbgxdcw6t6vgmcao5b6xdcut5hqd.onion/
[21:37:37] ASmith: are you sure that is the correct .onion address ?
[21:38:02] h0p3: This one: http://hwikiea2zykn5hdkmf4srti5gglqv5gspqt37opxnhtjdvureonvjoyd.onion/
[21:38:26] h0p3: It's loading on mine (slow AF, but it's huge..45MB html file, lmao)
[21:38:28] ASmith: ok, must have been a lame hold-over from Jaxx jumping down the rabbit hole as happens
[21:38:49] ASmith: yes, hypertext hop3, its slowly loading here via a relay
[21:39:02] ASmith: https://tascloud.me/index.php/login
[21:39:50] ASmith: hmm, not sure why you would have such a heavy loading time and files for a .onion site?
[21:39:52] h0p3: Still have my login from many moons ago. =) I think it's a fantastic service you offer to humans. 
[21:40:12] ASmith: I see, thanks you
[21:41:42] h0p3: There are many trade-offs to consider. Ultimately, I don't think it's fitting for Tor simply because it is so javascript reliant. But, it is built for offline use and sneakernets. 
[21:42:39] ASmith: ah, zeronets and such, IPFS ?
[21:43:08] h0p3: Yes, it's suited to those, imho.
[21:43:35] h0p3: There's only one call to make to the server, to download the file. After that, it's all clientside. Highly my preference. 
[21:44:03] ASmith: ah, loaded up, interesting
[21:44:50] ASmith: Meshnets would be interesting, I see law enforcement ate those up given the streaming bandwidth those provide
[21:45:21] ASmith: trunking and I see the meshnet antennas for the cops on man interstate overpasses now
[21:46:21] ASmith: china sells very powerful meshnet capable repeater amplifiers allowing 2-5 mile ranges
[21:46:35] h0p3: Meshnets have provided for the proletariat sometimes. I think it's the only way to cleanly solve "the last mile" problem, though fiber backbones will always be necessary for performance. 
[21:47:19] h0p3: I took a look into some of that tooling when I lived in Thailand (long ago) because it was so difficult to get even basic internet access (even in a "small" city with a million people). 
[21:47:30] ASmith: Fiber is very fragile, I have 2 main fiber feeds to my area and I can count and visibly see the impacts whenever even 1 is cut or disabled
[21:48:01] h0p3: I'm pretty worried that meshnetworks would be more easily disrupted and outlawed in the US. 
[21:48:44] h0p3: Hamradio has some similar problems, from what I recall. It's guarded, sniffed out. Feds don't like it one bit. 
[21:49:00] ASmith: in a national emergency, the WWW undersea relays (about 12) in USA would likely be disabled, leaving high latency feeder lines at best
[21:49:53] ASmith: yeah Hamradio is very guarded, however a mesh repeater albiet illegal wouldn't be targeted if a national emergency was unfolding they'd be focused on other areas
[21:50:00] h0p3: Probably kill switches all over The Stack. Meshing, direct point-to-point, and sneaker may be the only options under bad circumstances.
[21:50:19] ASmith: yep,
[21:50:56] ASmith: BRIC's nations were building their own WWW infranet bypassing USA and perhaps the UK also with their undersea high speed fiber cabling
[21:52:20] h0p3: What happened to it?
[21:52:44] ASmith: China likely finished it by now, no updates on that project, just silence
[21:53:27] h0p3: The Splinternet is real, lol.
[21:53:44] ASmith: yep, lol
[21:58:47] ASmith: under construction by 2015 the BRICS undersea cable WWW network shows no updates which seems odd
[21:59:28] h0p3: I could imagine that knowledge eventually being over our paygrades, hehe.
[21:59:31] ASmith: China's quantum communications have extended to their satellite traffic which I suspect the USA Gov hates being unable to hack them
[21:59:56] ASmith: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS_Cable
[22:00:03] h0p3: Aye. 
[22:00:08] ASmith: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRICS_Cable
[22:00:18] ASmith: The BRICS cable is intended "to circumvent the U.S. and NSA spying through ports in Russia, China, Singapore, India, Mauritius, South Africa, and Brazil."
[22:00:38] h0p3: Cozy networks
[22:01:05] ASmith: 12.8 Terabit/sec capacity
[22:01:10] h0p3: I saw that. Insane.
[22:01:58] ASmith: for most africans yes, for China that is a must I figure
[22:02:00] h0p3: I wonder if that is before or after compression.
[22:02:31] h0p3: Cited links don't say anything.
[22:02:44] ASmith: pushing that much data via 2 fiber cables is a insane amount of information, more than enough for astronomy observations in real time
[22:04:51] h0p3: There appears to be a refederation into Internet//s//. For a long time, my [[hope]] was to virtualize a network over these and eventually have the protocol built into firmware/hardware to have something compete. 
[22:05:27] h0p3: Idealism, ofc, lol. 
[22:05:52] ASmith: There's some updates in the 2020 papers of the BRICS Summit on their shared Cable
[22:06:11] ASmith: http://www.eeg.ru/files/lib/2020/Agenda%20-%20EN.pdf
[22:06:46] ASmith: Time to get back to it here in the lower 40 on the vertical stacking planter array bases
[22:07:00] h0p3: `/salute`. It is always my honor, sir. 
[22:07:27] ASmith: thanks for the chat and adding on ricochet, tox and your tracker for audio books, I haven't seen it yet but it'll likely eventually arrive
[22:07:43] ASmith: u2, cya
[22:07:44] ASmith: afk
"""

Enjoy it, sir. I see you've got it now.
