[[TTTOTW]]. Mi amor woke to the smell of burning toast (it was perfectly done :P) and came down to check. PTSD hypervigilance. Tuna on toast + water + SC2. [[TTTOTW]]. Sleep by 5?

Woke at 11? Rumination. Belly not feeling good. Spent a very long time meditating. 

Hugs'n'bugs. [[TTTOTW]]. Had lunch with [[ASK]].

Long Dadnap, again. It is quite a privilege. She woke me for the gathering.

[[Family Time]] was smooth, and my offspring spawned several discussions, and there was plenty of laughter too. =). 

Dev came for dinner. Vapelyfe. We watched what may be the most important episode of //Sherlock//(ed). 

Put folks to bed. Hugs'n'bugs. 

//The China Hustle// as [[ASK]] slept in my arms. 

[[TTTOTW]] + //The Money Masters//
<<<

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Vapelyfe. Bread, sauce and water. [[ASK]] awoke. //Skintime// + //Todd & the Book of Evil//. Sleep by 4?

Woke at 11:30. Meditation. Hugs'n'bugs for everyone. Adults made brunch for erryone. We went down to [[The Den]] to grind. Son playing in a something like an IDE for SQLite. My daughter is thinking more about unsafe [[Rust]], probably backing up to re-read at this point (good!). 

[[TTTOTW]]. +0/+1/+0 MWC vs Affinity. Clamp snowball won the first, and she prevented it and demolished me the other two. Controlled me into oblivion, not even a single swing at her.

[[JRE]] called. Biomom is preggo again. Feeling a bit helpless, sympathizing with a lack of men's reproductive rights (I'm reminded of Okrent). Asking about [[k0sh3k]]. Preventative maintenance job with freezing water explosion, and a need for waterproof storage and clothing kits in his truck. More racism at work, and taking sides with Aaron-senpai. Sad about his Roth IRA. IASIP podcast. Planning to see each [[other]] if we can over the summer (tricky with kids and finances, ofc). 

[[TTTOTW]].

Mi amor came home, and we went to check out a vehicle. Hilariously terrible navigation tonight. Talked about her insane day. SR put in her notice today, as predicted. We have not rooted the evil out, unfortunately. 

Assignments.

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. //Inform the Men!// Shower of the...fuck.

Wasn't draining correctly, so I used our two snakes. The big metal one actually got caught badly (and I've bent and warped it trying to get it out, unfortunately - I do need to get another one, as it has been useful). Cleaned what we could, started taking hardware apart (this is a very old tub, 70 years, and it's not in great shape). 

I understand that people in my home mark their territory by leaving their hair everywhere (and, as the person with the hairiest body in a square mile around me, I know how to leave my scent and dingleberries where they can be found with the best of them), but the clog in our bath, part of //The Commons//, is sad because: it is everyone's territory. Unfortunately, when we turn the sink in the bathroom on, it fills the tub. `/thumbs-up`. Able to get a trickle of water to go, I think the lock/seal mechanism has a problem, and I'm betting on at least one clog deeper in the pipes. Dismantling [[ASK]]'s happy place (temporarily). I suppose we're going to try to take the badboy apart downstairs tomorrow. Until then, I'll be washing my hands in the toilet (and grinning as my wife brushes her teeth at the kitchen sink, like a fucking savage...unless she wants to join me at the toilet [and, I'm way into that]).

[[Family Gathering]] was quite pleasant. Muffalettas (my daughter souped up some regular wheat bread into something far more), melon, and even some candy. Mental Yentl episode of //House//. Slowly grinding out green for [[The Proxy Cube]].

Mendax of [[MuWire]] and [[djuuss]] of Soulseek went hunting for html files. Feels like the old web.

Fell asleep pretty early, but I don't remember what time.
