>>> My [[Root User]], [[K]], laughed and said your remark was a high compliment. Made me giggle too. Thank you. I'm glad you enjoy my work. `/salute`. If you [[change]] your mind or have spoons to burn, feel free to HMU anytime. It can get lonely out here in desert, [[nomad]]. Remember that you can speak [[anonymous]]ly if you wish as well. 

>> Thanks a lot! Unfortunately I went to your website, and after reading for a few minutes, got an intense headache and passed out.
