Positivistically, without addressing the fundamental is/ought telic problem, there is a neutral-appearing and flat (though wildly incomplete) generic we can fashion. Pick your relative //X// agents or tribal beliefs+desires. Simply asking these questions isn't being critical enough. 

* [[W5H]] is the source?
** [[W5H]] did you learn about this action?
** [[W5H]] is planning, running, or calling the shots?
** Do you prior evidence of this source's work for or toward X?
** Is the source an X organizer?

* [[W5H]] is the intent? 
** Is the prompt seeking merely a performative action that is meant to be seen for sake of something other than X?
** [[W5H]] is the target of the prompted action?
** What is the goal or use of the prompted action to X organizers?
** Does X benefit from this action?

* [[W5H]] are the consequences?
** Will this action damage current efforts of X organizers?
** Will this silence X voices?
** Will this amplify X organizing goals?

Justification is a much harder problem than it looks, and plenty of self-proclaimed [[pleft]]ists are in deep trouble here.
