title: 2020.09.07 - Wiki Review: Reclusivity

* [[Sharing]]
** It's a start. 
* [[2020.09.06 - Family Log: DONT BITE THE SHIT OUTA ME!]]
** We're going to try to get back on track again. My predictions are poor here. It sucks watching your children throw it away. Lifetime consequences.
* [[2020.09.06 - Wiki Review: Is It A Redflag That So Many Dogs Around Me Become Pregnant?]]
** I am Polish, after all!
** Completed. I've not heard [[AIR]]'s voice as much, but I'm really glad that he's with us in text. Tres Hermanos.

** Leftovers didn't last at all. Lol. Welp, good thing no one was too hungry for dinner. 
** Mispredicted her desire to walk. I am surprised. She's so tired. That is quite a sacrifice.
* [[2020.09.06 - Prompted Introspection: Erry Week Joys]]
** I could make a life of that. My offspring won't be young or perhaps even with me for long though. I've almost given up on trying to integrate with society. Who knows what it will be like 10 years from now?
* [[2020.09.06 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Housing]]
** Completed. Surely, I will simply become a recluse's recluse. This is just what some crazy people have to do! It's my destiny.
* [[2020.09.05 - AIR: Cannacandy]]
** Given the desserts I've seen him make, I would not be surprised to see some works of art here. It's not even his specialty. Seems like something that one could perfect over the years too.
* [[2020.08.31 - AIR: Painted Nails]]
** Been a while since I painted my nails. I prefer just a clear coat. 
** Gotta be insanely lonely for him. I'm glad there is anyone who would be a bro.
