title: 2020.06.16 - Wiki Review: Paramilitarized police are a border patrol that exist to enforce compartmentalization between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie

** Reminds me of my disagreement with [[UJ]]. Even [[The Golden Rule]] offers external motivation. It's part of recognizing that something or someone besides ourselves has external value. The internalism egoistic libertarian bug sinks its nasty roots into pedagogy too. =/

** `/sigh`. Yup. At least you have something to say about it. 
*** It will be important to show your offspring!
** I know that if I can only get some things done (or only feel like it), [[TDL]] and [[CTS]] are on a timer.

** I hate that I'm keeping it, but it's the right thing to do.

** It feels like I have no one to talk with about this problem. The data scientists are so busy trying to even understand the machinations that they do not understand [[Humanity]]. The folks who really know what they are doing are so busy building tools for capitalism too. The [[pleft]]ists I know, even the skilled computer users, do not undersatnd the philosophical and political nature of technology well enough. I feel like I'm waiting for a messiah, oracle, or at least someone to speak with.

** I'm going to bet that it was the HN post that led him to initially realize what I do with my family.
*** Interesting to see [[kicks]] picking out where he first met me, [[https://www.kickscondor.com/notes/engage-the-wiki]]. I don't remember where I first saw him. =/. 
**** I have so many thoughts I don't even know how to write them down. I also think it is wise for me to just listen in this space. As usual, I do more than my fair share of talking.
***** I will add (immediately breaking my own rule) that speaking directly to me is so much more expensive than speaking indirectly. Regardless of what happens, you all have brought light to my life that I don't even know how to express. I say many things are my honor, and they are, but it's been like a miracle to know you all. I have no idea how to represent what you mean to me well enough. It is weirdly joyous that there even places that you know me better than my wife. It gives me [[hope]] for [[Humanity]].

** I had it set up to talk about with [[TWGGF]], and I had thought about just sending it to David Gifford. I'm not convinced it is worth my time.

** That boy has such an uphill battle to find people who will understand him. I'm doing what I can. 
*** He is evidence to me that people are far more capable than we want to believe. People don't want to recognize their responsibilities.

** I have not found it worth my time to post what I think to the forums. If they are interested in what I think, they can find it.
