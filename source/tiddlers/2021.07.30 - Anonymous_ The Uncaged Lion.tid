//Only the dregs of society would dare lurk such bleak corners of the interwebs. I'm a god damn madman in the desert. Here we see people who perhaps want something more than a parasocial relationship but don't want to pay a higher price for it. We throw people away in our culture. Inhospitality is our real pasttime and heritage. It's ingrained into our norms even in meatspace; it's simply more obvious online, especially in these contexts. [[W5H]] ought we politely decline to continue a conversation or a relationship? I'm not convinced people are really looking for an answer. I don't know how to be useful to these people. Even if I am not surprised and continue to have my [[bias]] confirmed, I must be courageous about hearing stupid arguments from evil people; they too are a whetstone (though not mere means) for my models. Without losing [[hope]], it's important that I remind myself of the virtual futility of [[civility]], let alone [[intimacy]], in both theory and practice. Continue the march in the desert.//

You: Hello. =)
Stranger: Hi
You: First time on this site for me.
You: You come here often?
Stranger: Me too actually
You: Ah, cool.
You: What brought you here?
Stranger: Got tired of trying to talk to people on Omegle
You: Lmao
You: That's exactly why I came here.
You: Okay, so, what about Omegle frustrated you?
Stranger: Being a girl on there is awful
You: Yeah. =/
You: It may be the case that 80% of the people there are looking to sext with a female. That's my guess.
You: What kind of conversation are you looking to have?
Stranger: I stupidly thought it was actually a chat site.
You: It can be, but it seems like you have to go through 10-20 chats to find one that works. The failure rate is quite high, imho.
You: I'm beginning to think that most do not see it as a chat site, but a place for bored, horny narcissists to congregate.
You: There's a problem that arises with anonymity. People show their true colors when they aren't going to be held accountable.
Stranger: Alright freud, calm yourself! The lion must get back in it's cage! Wtf

Lmao. "IT PuTS The LoTION ON ITs SkiN." `/rawr`. You got that right, kid. This wasn't nihilistic antagonism. I was thinking with you about it. But, after that reaction: `/sniff`. Do I detect blood in the water? You feeling the heat? Did I hit too close to home? XD. Grinding on trash mobs, hacking and slashing through this pubstomp dungeon crawl (merch link in bio). Truth is often especially repulsive to those who aren't looking for it. It cuts right through. At least it saves me some heartache.

<br>

You: Hello. =)
Stranger: Hey
Stranger: M
You: What you brings you here?
You: I just came from Omegle.
Stranger: Ohh
Stranger: Searching for a gf
You: Ah.
Stranger: Are u f?
You: I'm afraid I won't be directly useful to you there. Sadly.
You: I am not.

You: I know very little about this site.
black doomer incel 22 !: i be a established veteran of these good old assed talk to a stranger websites
You: Oh. Cool.
You: I suppose this place is something like speed-dating + gambling.
You: I'm not a veteran user, though I've periodically tried sites like these for a long time.
black doomer incel 22 !: no it dont have to be
You: I agree.
You: Why do you think it doesn't have to be?

I don't consider my answer defection. 

<br>

You: Heyo. =)
Stranger: Hi
You: What brings you here today?
Stranger: Good
Stranger: Pakistan ðŸ‡µðŸ‡°
You: Hrm. This is weird. I'm running two instances in chromium. I'm wondering if I see your messaging both.
You: How's life in Pakistan?
You: your messaging in both*
You: 1
You: 3
You: Did you see 1-4?
Stranger: Hadia
You: Hadia. I don't think I've ever heard that name before.
You: Does your name mean a lot to you?

You: Heyo. =)
Stranger: How are you
You: I'm doing alright.
You: How about you?
Stranger: Nothing
You: Nothing? That's an interesting way to be. You feeling nothingness?
Stranger: Where are you from
You: I live in the US. Lived here most of my life.
You: How about you?
You: 2
You: 4
Stranger: Here is too good
Stranger: Yup
You: Okay. I see.
You: That's hilarious.
You: Good to know.
Stranger: ??what
Stranger: Btw,ur name and age
You: Let me try to explain. I didn't say it well. I've got two browser open on this site. The failure rate for finding a conversation is quite high. I thought maybe I could have multiple instances to sift. That isn't going to work.
You: My name is h0p3. I am 35. This is me: https://philosopher.life/
You: What should I call you? How old are you?

This was my fault. =/. Sorry. 

<br>

You: Heyo. =)
Stranger: Hi
You: What brings you here today?
Stranger: Woman wbu
You: I'm a person. I'm not a fan of the ASL opener.
You: (I will tell you, but I want to start a conversation first)
Stranger: Ok
You: So, what brings you here today?
Stranger: Hell
You: Ha.
You: Yeah.
You: What's making life hell for ya?
Stranger: And boredom
You: I know that feel, like nothing matters or is worth my attention.
Stranger: Boredom is making my life hell
You: You're on the hunt to find what really matters.
Stranger: Yeah that's what's going on
You: There's a sense in which I'm here for that too. I get that.
You: Finding people who want to talk, become intimate (not necessarily in a sexual sense, but more in a trusting, mutually revealing who we are together sense).

<br>

Stranger: Hey
You: Heyo. =)
You: What brings you here today?
Stranger: Age?
Stranger: Bored
You: I am 35. Ancient.
Stranger: U?
Stranger: Lol. I'm 39
You: I don't feel bored, but perhaps there is some element of boredom or looking through randomness to find gems.
Stranger: I'm m
Stranger: U?
You: I'm a person. :P
You: I don't mind revealing it, but I feel like ASL is used to sort for reasons that seem unreasonable to me.
You: Like people aren't really here to speak with a total stranger.
Stranger: Interesting
You: Most* that is.
You: There are exceptions though.
Stranger: I get tired of talking to young people
Stranger: Too much drama
You: Yeah. =/. It can be difficult to hold a serious conversation with them.
Stranger: And unrealistic expectations
You: That too.
Stranger: And I prefer talking to other guys
You: I'm not convinced many have enough experience with [[intimacy]] (https://philosopher.life/#Fostering%20Intimacy) to know what to look for.
You: I agree that I tend to have the most success speaking with other men.
You: I don't know what to make of that.
Stranger: Normally because they are here looking for a jo buddy
You: Lol. Yeah.
Stranger: That's a very pure goal
You: High rates of "I'm bored and horny."
Stranger: Yep
You: Thank you. That's the best I can do for a stranger out here in the desert.
You: You a heavy computer user?
Stranger: And that's fine by me as long as that's what they are looking for
Stranger: Some
Stranger: What are you looking for?
You: I'm looking for [[The Other]]. https://philosopher.life/#Find%20The%20Others
You: How about you?
Stranger: Interesting convo about sex and relationship
Stranger: Jo buddy. Trade pics.
You: Oh, I talk about sex all the time. I don't mind talking about that at all.
You: Unfortunately, I won't be useful to you has a Jo buddy or trading pics. It's very rare that I reveal my pictures to anyone (perhaps I'm a hideous monster ;P).
Stranger: How often do you stroke your cock
You: I [[masturbate]], on average, two times a day.
Stranger: Nice
Stranger: When was your last fuck
You: No doubt. I think it's a privilege to have the time to do it.
You: Today, about 4 o'clock with my wife.
Stranger: Nice
You: Indeed! Lol.
Stranger: You straight or bi?
You: She's been in a lot of pain lately, so I've not had the chance in several days.
Stranger: Mine was today about 12:30
You: I would consider myself heteroflexible. Never had a gay encounter, but I'm not opposed to it. It's just not appealing enough to me.
You: Dope. `/high-5`
You: You spend a lot of time thinking about sex too?
Stranger: Interesting
Stranger: Yep
You: Do you consider yourself hypersexual?
Stranger: We are in a very sexual relationship
You: A blessing.
Stranger: Not hyper but active
Stranger: We are in a closed mmf triad
You: Neat.
Stranger: It works exceptionally well for us
Stranger: U shave smooth, trim, or have a full bush?
You: My wife is fine with me having sex with others, but I'd prefer to get to know someone quite well. I'd adore seeing my wife bang anyone and everyone, but she borders on asexual spectrum. She only has sex because I want to have it.
You: Complete bush. I am in the 99th percentile for pubic hair length.
You: How did you end up in the mmf triad?
Stranger: Have you ever watched another guy bang ur wife
You: No. She has no interest at all in such a thing.
You: Which is fine with me. It's merely a fantasy for me.
Stranger: We started having a threesome w our friend and it became very regular
Stranger: Then he moved in
You: How does that initial conversation for the threesome go?
Stranger: I'm shaved smooth
Stranger: Hey dear, X thinks ur hot. Do you care if we talk about your nude pics? Are you ok if I show him?
You: Haha. Noice.
Stranger: He has a serious fantasy to fuck u. Do you think that would be hot?
You: Yup. I see.
You: That makes sense.
Stranger: Work her up
Stranger: Get his buy in
Stranger: Flirt like hell
Stranger: Then fuck
You: What consists in flirting to you?
Stranger: Anything short of fucking
You: (I'm severely autistic, so I don't know it when I see it)
You: Achktually* every interaction that isn't fucking counts as flirting then. XD.
Stranger: Are you stroking ur cock now?
You: Lol. No.
You: Not even chubbed up.
You: Just talking to you, my friend.
Stranger: Interesting
Stranger: Does ur wife shave? Full bush? Landing strip?
You: She leaves it alone.
Stranger: We both mf her.
Stranger: And we mmf
Stranger: And we mm
You: She would have no interest, as I said.
You: She'd laugh though.
You: It's not like she doesn't have orgasms or ever pursue sexual relations of any kind, but it's just not the same drive for her.
Stranger: Does she suck your cock
You: She likes to read in the same way that you and I like to think about sex.
You: Occasionally.
You: I prefer to give oral than receive. I'm quite particular about my penis.
You: So is this the sort of conversation you often have on imeetzu?
Stranger: Talk about fav positions, goals of things to try, what you have already done
Stranger: Swap wife pics, self pics, other random porn
You: Does the live interactive portion of it add a lot for you?
Stranger: Depends. It can
You: Like, for me, I research and curate that information, but it's rarely relevant in speaking directly with almost anyone. Though, I will joke about sex constantly.
Stranger: Ic
Stranger: But u don't seem aroused atm
You: Zero.
You: I'm literally just talking with you. This is what you want to talk about, and that's reasonable enough to my eyes.
You: Grown ass men should be able to have frank discussions about sex. This a crucial feature of our lives as human beings.
Stranger: How often do you fuck
You: It varies. I'd say 2-3 times a week.
Stranger: Not bad
Stranger: U enjoy porn?
You: I count myself [[lucky]].
You: Oh, immensely.
Stranger: Pics or vids?
You: I prefer [[vidya]] and erotic fiction (https://philosopher.life/#Links%3A%20Erotic%20Short%20Stories).
Stranger: 


You: Those are boobs. Congratulations.
Stranger: Yes they are
Stranger: Do you enjoy breasts
You: Ah, I adore everything about a hawt female. Head to toe. I want to eat them up.
You: Perhaps jokingly, I think people //might// be insane if they don't think tits are hawt.
Stranger: I enjoy those tits
You: `/high-5`
You: You have an exhibitionist streak in you.
Stranger: Yep
You: I can relate to that.
Stranger: Fucked outside today in plain sight
You: That makes excellent sense. I think fucking outdoors is a worthy adventure.
Stranger: We both fucked her
You: Civilization has lost something by having made it taboo.
Stranger: I'm pretty certain the neighbor guy two houses away saw us
You: He's a lucky man, of course.
Stranger: He stopped mowing
You: Who wouldn't? Lol.
Stranger: I'm assuming to watch and jack off
You: Oh, well, to watch, likely.
You: It's difficult to know their intentions and reactions otherwise.
Stranger: I hope it was good for him
You: Spreading joy to the world.
Stranger: Yep
You: I agree that there's something moral about that. I wish it were normalized and that we shared ourselves like that. I think it's not a high priority problem, but I think it's closer to the behavior we'd find in a utopia.
Stranger: People should fuck more
You: Preach, yo!
You: World would be a very different place.
Stranger: And express themselves sexually
You: It's a complex matter.
Stranger: And jack off. Men should cum at least once a day if not 2 or 3 times
You: I often think that sexual expression is overprioritized.
You: But, yes, I think that having orgasms everyday is, prima facie, a human right, it's valuable for our flourishing to some degree.
Stranger: I'm going to find a way to arouse my cock
You: Alright. `/salute`.
Stranger: Do you want to participate
You: I'm not interested in arousing you or participating as a Jo buddy, as I said at the beginning.
Stranger: Ok.
You: I'm happy to talk without it being about sexual gratification.

I do have some choice about whether or not I'm going to be aroused in some cases. Greyrock the predator.

<br>

You: Heyo! =)
Stranger: hi
Stranger: m or f???
You: I'm a person. =).

<br>

Stranger: M
You: Heyo. =)
You: What brings you here today?
Stranger: Chat you
You: Yup. I'm here to meet [[The Other]], so to speak.
You: Never know what experience I'll have with a stranger in the desert.
You: What would you like to chat about?
Stranger: You.were you from
Stranger: I'm from the uk
You: I'm from the US. I live in New England (not nearly as cool).
You: How's life in the UK going?
You: You feeling Brexit's effects?
Stranger: What do you do.brexit is a load of bollocks
You: Yeah, Brexit seems like a tragedy to me.
You: I am an extremely online person, a hiki, someone who lives in his basement and works on his computer tirelessly.
Stranger: I'm Paul
You: This is me: https://philosopher.life. I'm h0p3.
You: It's a pleasure to meet you.
You: How about you, what do you spend your time doing to survive? What do you do/prefer to do with your precious freetime?
Stranger: Iv lost a lot of people during this pandemic.so iv been feeling a bit shit.i like to run now.how about you
You: Oh. =(. Damn.
Stranger: Life.
You: I'm sorry to hear that.
You: Yeah, it does happen. =/.
You: I wish I enjoyed running. Once you get into it, from what I understand, it's easier to stick to it. Becomes chemically pleasurable even.
You: I read and write. That is what I do.
Stranger: It's ok you got to look forward.how do you type so fast
You: Oh, I have some decent practice on my keyboard.
Stranger: What do you like to read
You: Hrm. I used to read books and academic articles (https://philosopher.life/#Deep%20Reading). I spend far more time just reading from the web these days (with some exceptions). I keep a non-trivial [[Link Log]], https://philosopher.life/#Link%20Log
You: I try to understand humans and what we need to do in the world.
You: So, I try to read somewhat broadly (not an easy task).
You: I focus on [[Computing]], [[Philosophy]], and [[Justice]], but these all require broad kinds of knowledge to be useful.
You: How about you? What do you like to read?

<br>

You: Heyo! =)
Stranger: M
You: P, for person.
You: What brings you here today?
Stranger: Lol. So you a man?
You: That is also true.

Emily: Just boredom
You: Yes, it's nice to meet you too.
You: I hear that.
Emily: Haha
You: I think "bored and horny" are the most common replies.
Emily: Yeah usually lol
You: What makes for a good encounter or conversation on this site for you?
Emily: Idk haha. Just interesting people. People that make me want to talk to on Kik so we can keep talking
You: Ah. Nifty.
Emily: Idk really, just if we click I guess haha
You: Yeah, I'm trying something similar.
Emily: Oh really haha?
You: I don't use Kik, but I've got other means to be contacted (https://philosopher.life/#Contact%20h0p3).

Stranger: Bored so came here
Stranger: I'm fine thanks
Stranger: Where are you from

You: I'm from the US.
You: How about you?
Stranger: India
You: Dope.
Stranger: Lol
Stranger: I'm guy
Stranger: If you looking for girl ðŸ˜‚
You: I am looking for [[The Other]]. Doesn't have to be sexual, just friends or trying to be useful to people.
You: I appreciate that you feel the need to put up the disclaimer.
Stranger: OK
Stranger: But I'm looking for girls
You: Okay. I can appreciate that.
You: It's an important problem in our lives.
Stranger: Bye see you man
You: See you.
Stranger: ðŸ˜‚ yes
You: `/wave`
