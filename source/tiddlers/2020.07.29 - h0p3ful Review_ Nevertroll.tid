//You have literally nothing. Let's talk about it.//

[[h0p3]]: //You start.//

[[j3d1h]]: //If you are wondering what the hell I'm thinking, I'm trying to find something that you will actually appreciate. If I talk about this log and the way you are doing it, that's off topic.//

[[h0p3]]: //I'm sorry if you feel that way. I'm listening. Keep going.//

[[j3d1h]]: //I apologize, but that seems like a useless gesture.//

[[h0p3]]: //I believe you. Shit happens. Btw, are we RPing right meow?//

[[j3d1h]]: //Technically, this would not be an RP because we're not playing "specific characters," but we're likely only saying things we would want to be recorded in this [[TLDR]]. So that would make it count as roleplaying to a certain extent.//

[[h0p3]]: //`/bounces-beads-in-his-hand`//

[[j3d1h]]: //Hey, I didn't know you could italicize code outside of Dicksword, particularly in TW.//

[[h0p3]]: //Me neither.//

[[j3d1h]]: //Btw, this is a very interesting approach.//

[[h0p3]]: //What's interesting about it?//

[[j3d1h]]: //Also, btw: we're saying a lot of "btw"s for the fact that this is supposed to be "about." I'm not saying this correctly....Despite the fact that... STFU! =). I'm going to edit this log to say what I meant.//

[[h0p3]]: //As is your right, my love.//

[[j3d1h]]: //Let me guess: I'm not allowed to edit it because you are writing it.//

[[h0p3]]: //It's your wiki, loser.//

[[j3d1h]]: //It's also going to be in your wiki, loser.//

[[h0p3]]: //Yeah, I'll keep my own copy. I'm cool like that.//

[[j3d1h]]: //But, if I edit the record, then I'm just being dishonest.//

[[h0p3]]: //You are shitting me. We're like RPing here. There is no real dishonesty...right? RIGHT?//

[[j3d1h]]: //If you are not playing the character correctly, then you are being dishonest.//

[[h0p3]]: //Who is being dishonest, why should I agree, and what does it mean to play the character correctly? `/CnPs-mo-dialogue-template`//

[[j3d1h]]: //Oh god.//

[[h0p3]]: //Yup.//

[[j3d1h]]: //Give me a moment to write out what I want to say so that I can actually say it all in one line.//

[[h0p3]]: //`/patiently-waits-for-his-daughter-for-as-long-as-she-needs`//

[[j3d1h]]: //Scroll down so I can see what you said.//

[[h0p3]]: //`/scrolls-down`//

[[j3d1h]]: //Alright, here's the gist of it (I've put it all in lowercase so you can fix that...): the one playing the character incorrectly is being dishonest, because the point of the game is to play your character as accurately as you possibly can. if you don't do so, you simply aren't playing the game. i respect that you may not want to play it, but you started it, sir.//

[[h0p3]]: //`/reads-slowly-like-the-fucking-autist-RPer-he-is`//

[[j3d1h]]: //"Btw," you are being a better RPer by the standard of most roleplays in that you are actually putting actions in. //

[[h0p3]]: //What is the most important standard for RPing? What rules ought I follow? Why?//

[[j3d1h]]: //roleplay rules vary quite a bit! i've played by many different rulesets. it generally depends on who you're playing with, the setting of the game, the kind of character you are, and in general, the type of game you've agreed to play. (d&d is different from free-form, is different from classic rpgs, is different from [etc.]) i apologize if that made no sense.//

[[h0p3]]: //I understand your claim, I believe.//

[[j3d1h]]: //So...the most important standard is the one that the players agree with.//

[[h0p3]]: //Why should I agree to that?//

[[j3d1h]]: //Fine, the players and anyone affected by the game. They should have a choice or a say in it.//

[[h0p3]]: //Nasty hard lightcone reduction problem here.//

[[j3d1h]]: //I might also have a really narrow definition of roleplaying. That's because I speak with a lot of people who have a very narrow definition of RPing.//

[[h0p3]]: //I think it's fair to say I have a very narrow set of definitions I use to craft my poor semblance of a concept of RPing.//

[[j3d1h]]: //Yours is still much more open than anyone else I've ever met. That's because you are an asshole philosopher.//

[[h0p3]]: //`/tips-his-fedora`//

[[j3d1h]]: //you keep passing the turn back to me by simply writing down an action. we should bear the narration equally, as neither one of us is the gm here! (except that you are my father, which might count.)//

[[h0p3]]: //What makes you think I'm not bearing the weight of the narration every bit as much as you are?//

[[j3d1h]]: //I complimented, and you simply threw an emote out.//

[[h0p3]]: //Would you like to consider the whole of this on-the-spot improvised project? Isn't the fact that I'm engaging in this layered storytelling with you at least some kind of mental burden? I'm helping project the story in front of us. Consider it a form of mechanical spellcasting, if you will.//

[[j3d1h]]: //You say that like it isn't some kind of mental burden on me just talking to you.//

[[h0p3]]: //I don't deny that you are pulling your weight here, and I agree that speaking with me is an egregious waste of your precious time and energy in many respects. It's my pleasure and my honor to have conversations with you, whether through RP or through our [[CDR]]s, dialectures, [[Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση]], standing around, on a walk, over messengers, our wikis, whatever it takes.//

[[j3d1h]]: //<<footnote "sorry to almost completely derail this - put this in a footnote, or just don't record it, if you want - but it's fascinating that you're emoting more than me, because i am almost always the over-narrator in standard roleplays! i just can't find an action i want to take in this case, beyond talking."

[[h0p3]]: //`/obeys`//

[[j3d1h]]: //You are a heathen.//

[[h0p3]]: //Why thank you, madame. I work very hard to be the worst kind of person in existence, as you point out.//

[[j3d1h]]: //When a philosopher says they want to be the worst person in existence, they usually intend for ''everyone else'' to become ''better.''//

[[h0p3]]: //That is much higher praise than I deserve. Have you ever smelled my farts?//

[[j3d1h]]: //Unfortunately, yes.//

[[h0p3]]: //''btw'', I'm having fun with you, and I [[love]] [[you|j3d1h]].//

[[j3d1h]]: //Human Emotions Are Disgusting.//

[[h0p3]]: //Get them off me, plz.//

[[j3d1h]]: //I'm sorry: it's too late for you. You only have one day left to live.//

[[h0p3]]: //If I only had one more day to live, I'm glad to spend these moments speaking with you right now.//

[[j3d1h]]: //Okay, now I don't want to give a sarcastic or mean response because that's actually really sweet.//

[[j3d1h]]: //sparing your emotions is now off the table entirely, clown. you have made a horrible mistake; wishing to spend some of your last precious moments with me will only increase the suffering.//

[[h0p3]]: //How would you like me to suffer most?//

[[j3d1h]]: //hell could not possibly burn hot enough. perhaps deep-diving in an ocean of those tiny little manmade thorns you call "legos" will suffice.//

[[h0p3]]: //I would bet it would not be staggeringly painful (though still painful) to land in a significant pool of those legos. There's a reason it hurts to land on just one of those bastards more than an Olympic-size swimming pool of them. I am [[grateful]] that it will suffice, [[friend]].//

[[j3d1h]]: //`*She looks up a basic term in physics, because for some reason, she never learned this crap.*` yeah, yeah, Distributed Force or whatever. stop being a nerd, nerd. - (I have switched characters about three times now)//

[[h0p3]]: //I try to play as me. I aint so good at this art of RPing, I reckon.//

[[j3d1h]]: //Actually, that tends to be a good sign! Most good actors and RPers simply "become" the character in the moment, though I don't think it counts if you were the character all along.//

[[h0p3]]: //I am unqualified to judge here. All I can say is: I really, really want to see your [[CDR]]s completed for tomorrow's [[h0p3ful Review]], also ur schoolwork. What meal do you guys want to make?//
