Hey hey brother, you alive and well?
Yes, sir. I'm hanging in there. Life continues well enough.
How's life for you and yours?
That’s good. Everyone healthy? I’m good man, got moved to Kentucky, been helping my dad with some stuff.
Everyone has been healthy. `/knock-on-wood`. Live such a cloistered life that we're at lower risk for lots of things.
What have you been diong with your dad?
How's he doing?
You feeling largely recovered?

You
What have you been diong with your dad?
Hauling gravel to fill in at his farm. It gets so muddy here. He’s been good, he and my mom got covid then his cow was calving so I had to come help him track it down and he infected me. But we’re better now. We had all the right stuff to take so it was like a flu week.  Man, I’m probably as recovered as I ever will be. My back is just *jacked* and always will be until we master cyber spines. Haha
Lol!
But overall I’m good. Getting my new place in order and trying to get rid of some stuff.
I'm glad to hear yall are feeling good. Hauling gravel isn't always a lot of fun.
[[T-Money]] came over for a couple of days. The first socialization I’ve had in a while.
You guys have a good time?
Yeah, always. It’s just weird having people around when you’ve been alone so long.
I’m a hermit.
My computer is my Wilson Volleyball.
Dude you’re married. Lol
That is true. lol. =)
I do appreciate, it is different.
What's it like connecting again with a person after not having seen any for a while?
Fine, we talk all the time on here.
So it wasn’t anything weird. Just having to interact with someone one on one… it’s so sad that this sort of feeling is commonplace right now.
Yes, sir. I agree.
Perhaps the most crucial epidemic.
Chechnyans chopping off mofos heads right now and I’m over here first world probs.
That is a good point.
We are extremely fortunate.

You
Perhaps the most crucial epidemic.
I read in 2020 incidental deaths were above previous years and well over COVID deaths.
And that was only June. The residual effects of this is going to devastate a generation.
Yes, sir. I am confident you are correct there.
I think my homeschooled nieces and nephews weathered it the best out of the kids I know.
Hell yeah.
How are you they doing?
they*
They’re good. My oldest niece just got her license and had an accident, so she’s not driving right now. I have to go over there next week to help out while my bro and his wife go to Raleigh for a while.
She’s fine, just bruised.
I only have flashes of memories of your nephews/nieces.
I know they are older now, but hard to imagine.
[Pic of Niece]
I'm glad they've weathered this storm so well.
=D
[Pic of Another Niece]
All grown up, sir.
[Pic of Brother's Immediate Fam]
lol, there’s the one I was looking for.
Nephew is a realtor now
How's he been doing in it?
Not too good right now. It’s slow.
Must be interesting times for him.
He’s had a couple small sales.
I told him the best thing that could happen is there to be a crash. He’s living at home and can survive what all these others can’t.
How major a crash?
He interned during the covid boom and had grand plans. Haha.
Yeah.

You
How major a crash?
2010? Is that when it was?
I don’t even remember. Too much drama since then.
There was one way back around then. So, like that then.
I'm worried that very large financial institutions would hoover up most of the real estate.
They already did.
Black rock man
Yeah. It is occurring.
The great reset.
You will not own anything. Only rent.
And you will like it!
XD
Or, your social score will go down if you complain about it on Meta.
Dude. Have you listened to any of Klaus Schwabs stuff? Head of the World Economic Forum?
Really up to the consumer what they want to do it. Fully consensual.
We’re so close to….
I've not listened to any of it yet. What should I be lookin' for?
[Inevitability.gif]
Unfortunately, the beauty of it is partially lost on me. I am ignorant of this clip.

You
I've not listened to any of it yet. What should I be lookin' for?
Just him talking about what he wants to accomplish.
I just meant the word. I was looking for the matrix agent smith choking neo waiting on the subway train, but this had to suffice.
I feel like we’re on or just over the tipping point.
That is possible. I'm not able to make predictions.

Poyfeck
I’m not either. Just guess out of my butt.
Sometimes that's all we can do.
How's the wife's job?  She loving it at... Yale?
She finds the politics exhausting, but she adores her students and serving people the information they want or need.
It's her vocation.
Can't say we fit in at Yale, but we're not really gonna try.
She is good at her job, and that counts for a lot.
Haha, yeah I can't imagine being put into a hoity toity setting.
I feel out of place in upper middle class.
We're basically out of place anywhere we go. Aliens, practically.
Librarians can get away with it, thankfully.
Ditto, I stopped trying to care any more.
A hard problem, no doubt.
What have you been reading lately?
Not enough. Lol.
Drowning in thousands of tabs.
Can we ever read *enough*?
In some contexts, yes.
I'm still searching for answers, and, unfortunately, I'm not finding any.
I mean, if you read furry porn or something, sure.
Go back to the beginning.  :)
In the beginning...
Yes, sir. I do work hard on that problem.
I agree with you.
Slice and dice through many of my opponents because they fail to account for that problem correctly.
No need to slice and dice me, I'm already cut.
I aint here to cut ya.
You've been through a lot.
[The Star of David.ico]
Meh, I don't feel sorry for myself.  I brought it all on myself.
I'm fine.
No, sir. I don't think you have. The sins we pay for stretch back through the generations.
For sure, but I have my own as well.
Yes, sir. Me too.
But I knew better.
Was raised better.
Not better than you, just saying raised better than I behaved.
I have long respected your open mind and willingness to engage those who disagree with you (especially when they obviously did not like you, and not necessarily for justified reasons either).
You often have epistemic humility.
Berea was an odd place for you to attend, lol.
I'm glad you did, and I'm glad to know you.
I appreciate that.  I know I'm closed minded but I love to learn and engage with others.  Part of the best part of hanging out with all the foreigners in college.
Indeed.

You
I'm glad you did, and I'm glad to know you.
Same man, I still talk to more people from there than any other point in my life.
My arrogance has definitely been tempered since college.
You've had to survive quite a bit.
Tampered I mean?
Both maybe.
:P
I'm still a POS, I can't change that much.
:)
I'm still learning who you are, sir.
Hermits are famous for their transformations too.
Have you ever seen the movie "They Live"?
Never even heard of it. Searching now.
Oh man, it's a cheesy action flick but it's worth the watch.
I'm watching his other one, "Hell Comes to Frog Town" now.
My sympaticon agrees with you, and she recommends it too.
Few more seconds and I'll have it down.
I'm envying my neighbor's internet.
Noice.
My neighbors wifi.
lol
That problem get squared away for ya?
You doing satellite?
The parents are waiting on their Star Link, I might order it if they like it.  Right now I have tmobile broadband.  Unlimited through cell signal.
What's that connection like?
brb
Do you experience any trouble with CGNAT?
[Screenshots, Speedtests]
You
Do you experience any trouble with CGNAT?
Honestly, no idea.
That is not shabby at all. Better upload than we have wired up.
I use a vpn at all times.
`/nod`
How much latency does it add on average?
I had fiber in Nashville, I was getting like 300 dl
Do you keep your system firewalled in such a way that if there is a drop in the VPN connection, you don't connect in the clear?
Hawt
I'm at 63 routed through Toronto
So 20% more?
YUGE
Hehe =)
Can still game on that, I suppose.
I don't game.  I don't want to invest time into anything and if I played online I'd wanna do pvp
I download too much to put my data in gaming.  lol
I hear that.
Building my cyber library for when it's all cancelled.
An expensive part of growing up, I think.
Thank God for pirates.
Tell me all about it. I want to know your thought process, appoach, the whole shebang.
Yes, sir.
(And, if there is anything you need to me find, please let me know)
I'm downloading all the good or halfway good older movies, shows that I can think of, books, comics, music.
Movies are all types, shows I'm focusing on 2010 and back.
You remind me of [[ASmith]] in that regard.
What's your hardware for this?

You
You remind me of [[ASmith]] in that regard.
In what regard?
[[Unorthodox Savings]] might be of interest to you, btw.
Oh man I'm minor right now, still trying to fill 7TB
External hard drives.
Collecting media for whatever the fuck may be coming.
Same here.
I don't keep much.
Right now, I'm in the process of downloading all of the old The Shadow pulps and I'm going to seed them.  My first seed. heh
Dope.
You might consider [[connect]]ing to other networks for [[sharing]] too.
I can't find them in a collection anywhere.  But I have a good book site that has them all but I only download like 10 a day.

You
You might consider [[connect]]ing to other networks for [[sharing]] too.
I'd love to do that.
You have a myanon account?
No, what is it?
An excellent source of books and audiobooks. You should not go without. Very, very easy to maintain ratio (point system is wildly broken on purpose). I don't like that it's private or uses a centralized tracker, but I'm asking too much I think.
I'm happy to send you an invite.
https://ppomes.github.io/myanon/
This?

You
I'm happy to send you an invite.
of course
Nope. That's an interesting tool though.
myanonamouse.net/
If you speak whatever language it was written in.
;)
Your account with them will be tied to an e-mail account. I need to send the invite to your email through them.
jeremiah.london@pm.me
Sent
Cool, got it set
I'll check it out later.
Dope.
How's the chittlins doing?
Finding themselves, I think.
They can do the basics, and they will survive.
Heheh, good luck to them on that.
Finding themselves, I mean.
I'm like a line behind.
Yeah, lol. I'm still searching too.
Naw, it's way funnier to read it out of context anyway, lol
Reminds me of that web site, textsfromlastnight.com
This is delicious. Thank you.
My ex used to read them to me all the time, circa 2010.
Some of these are classic memes too.
omg could you imagine having your face as a meme?
Miserable.
Gettin' recognized in the streets for it.
Although... you could capitalize on it.
Look at that harlot Bahd Babie
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkmOnEFCyI0
In case you didn't know the pop culture icon.
I didn't. So much new to me.
I spend all day on my machine, and don't know shit, lol.
I like her flow.
For some reason I feel the need to keep up on pop culture for all the conversation I have with the fairer sex.
Finding common ground is hard AF.
I haven't spoken to a girl in interest in years man.
Probably almost 2.
Trying to avoid fornication.
Hard to do.
Not if you don't talk to them.
hehe.
[Roll Safe.jpg]
Your maymay game is on point.
I'm sure the ladies must admire that.
I'm great until we get into anything of substance.  I'm not the right cut for the modern woman.
wom*n
But I'll be danged if the baby fever isn't real.
I can't say most people are actually interested in committing themselves.
part of the explanation for that epidemic of loneliness
I just don't trust 'em.
I don't know I could bring myself to risk another kid with a woman.
Well, I think it can be quite rational for anyone to have doubts about procreating these days.
The Elite need their cannon fodder.
Yes, sir.
Yet still we're commanded to procreate.
I ask you to look carefully at what Paul says here.
I still can't reconcile Paul.
Me neither, sir.
I'm listening to a book about revelations right now.  I thought it was about the book Revelation because I'm reading prophecy right now.  She isn't a believer though, but like anything you can glean a couple nuggets from it if you listen closely.
But she's talking about Paul's relationship to James and the other Apostle.s
Eschatology is, without a doubt, my primary concern in interpreting Paul.
I'm more troubled by his instructions.
The OT tells us that a man is blessed who finds a wife.  Paul says it's better to be single and witness, BUT if you have to.  huff
Aye.
We can't all be martyrs now Paul.
XD
I've been reading Isaiah.  Trying to discern if it applies to what's happening now.
another branch of.... Eschatology *copy paste [[h0p3]]s big word I had to google*
That makes sense to me.
Waiting for Gog and Magog to invade.
My caveman name is Grogg.
4chan Grugg is great
=D
Long nose want Grugg's club
Grugg give club
Long nose take Gruggs woman and beat Grugg with club
You ever seen China, IL?
Nope
When you are in need of a serious treat, slowly consume it (despite how rewatchable it is). It's art.
Babycakes is quite the caveman.
A prophet even.
Grabbing the seasons now.
Orwell was a prophet.
That he was.
Keep a hollowed out copy of his works on [[m16]].
I never thought Animal Farm and 1984 would happen at the same time.
Practically telescopic.
ALright broski, I need to get to bed.  This Signal thing works both ways, I think.  :)
I am in global [[Reply Mode]]. I do appreciate speaking. Thank you. Sleep well!
