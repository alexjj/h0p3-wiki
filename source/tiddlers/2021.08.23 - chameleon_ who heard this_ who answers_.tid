O Sage,

What is a self? I think there's some boundary (more like a threshold) where self becomes other and vice-a-versa-vice-a-da-pizza-pie! To wit, you obviously have your own thoughts and memories that no-one else can access. How much of that self is a social fiction (a social self)? Hermits have no need of names. Chapmanic [[triad|https://meaningness.com/self-schematic-overview]]: True Self, No-Self, Intermittent Continuity.

Alan Watts is [[the one you're speaking to|https://philosopher.life/#Why%20Not%20A%20Wide%20Area%20Network%2C%20Watson%3F]], I presume. He is rather a straightforward outcome of the New Age. We need answers from the East translated into English (because information rots if left untended) but translation is not a straight transformation. Language crystallizes thoughts, and so a little of yourself will be mixed in with the translation. Watts' great error then was to find one idea (no-self) he really latched onto and used it like kosher salt and MSG to flavor everything he came across. He is an old rasslin' partner of mine.

Zen is a depression cure. It's [[The Good]] disguised as nihilism. Sitting quietly will do one a lot of good; the problem is when you read too much into the shit they tell you to get you to sit quietly.

I hope you can find something pearl-ish among the Watts ocean. He was a prolific man if nothing else.
