*[[Fatalism]]
** Ruh-roh, yogi.
*[[2020.05.07 - YTDL: imblore]]
** How's the pidding going on the labtob?
** Thank you for writing the [[TDL]].
*[[2020/05/07 -- Antipleonasm Analysis: @/k0sh3k]]
** I think we should all consider taking a break. Maybe at the end of June?
*[[2020/05/07 -- Prompted Introspection: Same Difference]]
** Yes.

** lmao. =) -  I'm so glad you fix my problems for me. 
*** He does need to listen to you. We're working on it.
** [[Fatalism]] looks bad.
** I'm sorry you felt left out. That sucks. =(. I know that feeling.
*** Your brother and I did not see you cry. It must have been a difficult.
*** I cannot say it was your fault, and I think you should be open to the claim it is not to at least some significant [[dok]]. 
*** Do you feel like you weren't pulling your weight?
**** Sometimes you won't be able to pull your weight in a single instance. I think it's about a long-term average.
**** Did the other players feel like you weren't pulling your weight?
***** Doesn't seem like you have any social pressures to worry about here.
*** Do you feel like you were dragged through it, like you didn't have autonomy?
*** Were you simply unhappy with your characters position in the world (and OOC context)?
**** Do you feel you just couldn't relate to you character?
*** There are a variety of reasons one might not enjoy a game or enjoy being with others. 
*** You know, sometimes I cry given feelings or reasons that are separate from the context in which I cried. I also cry when I'm overwhelmed. As you know, crying is normal (it's important to get it out).
**** Part of me is glad that you have such strong feelings. I wish it weren't painful for you.
***** One of my worries as your dad is that I've taught you how to be a robot rather than a human. 
****** It will take time to develop what will likely be some incredibly rich sensibilities and feelings that many will fail to empathize with and understand.
******* You live in an intense environment. There are few adults who could stand in your shoes.
******* As you know, I'm exceptionally concerned about your loneliness. 
***** Part of your intelligence is a consequence of your profound sensitivity. I anticipate that you will continue to have mood swings, intense feelings, high highs, low lows, and everything in between.  Your system 1 is physiologically quite developed.
****** I am grateful that you aim to be constructive with it. Remember the stoic consideration: //this too shall pass//. Still, I think it is a good thing that you fully feel those emotions.
*** There are limits to what immediate analysis can provide. Might give it a `/welp`, and keep it in the ol' memory banks for later pattern recognition.

** I think the sbeve mechanic is cute, it holds my attention, it's poetic in a way. 
*** Yeah, anything can hold my attention. Of course, of course, as you say: I'm too easy to impress. I know, I know. Like a butterfly, my attention flits from one flower to the next.
** There is a "merit" that is positivistically de-normified in the "virtue of the practice" instrumental reasoning sense that I'm after here. For example, there is a "merit" to being a skilled serial killer, in a sense, even if objectively it does not have unqualified (poorly enriched maxim) categorical merit.
** I will remind you about the alias search. That is a pretty crucial puzzle piece it seems. 
*** I do not understand why I don't see more people relying upon aliases like I do. This is so odd me. 
** I agree that [[VIXI]] is not fleshed out enough. It looks like it could be profoundly enriched.
*** I hope you just start ripping from everything. Pull and filter the world into it. Or not.
**** I really don't understand RPing well enough to say anything. I know how I would construct stories, worlds, and mechanisms if I felt compelled. 
** I have no idea what you are talking about with the tagpills. 
*** You should make your [[Tagging Theory]] as explicit as you can. Maybe we can dream up some new mechanics here. 
*[[The Lightning Thief // Chapter Nine]]
** My first thought is: thank you for doing your mother's work. I appreciate it more than I know how to say.
*** She's a damned good teacher, better than I'll ever be. Give her your best.
** I don't know what to say. I already know you can do this (for half your lifetime thus far, I'd argue). I'm glad you do it. Keep practicing. If you are after my approval: I approve of your choice to put forth effort.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** Tags for [[Commenting of other people's code]]
*** I <3 this project. You want to write code well? Read it, like the wind.
**** I miss this so much. I hope you change your mind some day.
**** Your math and CS for 2020 barely exist, `/wail`.
