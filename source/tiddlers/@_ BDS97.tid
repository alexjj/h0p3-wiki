Once more with our tradition, my friend, I speak to you on the new year. I can see you've been thinking about Christianity more (I'm glad to see you wrestling with [[philosophy of religion|https://www.reddit.com/r/Patriots/comments/rqrajs/who_else_would_accept_this_deal_im_in/hqdhb64/]]), playing [[games]], and enjoying your stories (life is strange, indeed). I [[hope]] your photography has been satisfying and useful [[irwartfrr]]. Though you are not explicit about it: seems like you are on the hunt for companionship and purpose, mate. I am, as usual, still somehow surprised by your increasing participation on [[Reddit]] (plenty to [[talk about|https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/rhnjc3/no_spoilers_is_there_a_reason_as_to_why_theres_so/hosho6o/]]). It is a [[PSM]]. It's interesting to see you change your mind. I can see some of your interests, but not really much about who you are otherwise. [[Preach, yo!]] about [[dat unicode|https://www.reddit.com/r/Patriots/comments/rgi0ix/%F0%9D%97%A5%F0%9D%97%BC%F0%9D%97%AF%F0%9D%97%B2%F0%9D%97%BF%F0%9D%98%81_%F0%9D%97%9E%F0%9D%97%BF%F0%9D%97%AE%F0%9D%97%B3%F0%9D%98%81_%F0%9D%97%B7%F0%9D%97%BC%F0%9D%97%B6%F0%9D%97%BB%F0%9D%97%B2%F0%9D%97%B1_%F0%9D%97%9D%F0%9D%97%AE%F0%9D%97%B8%F0%9D%97%BC%F0%9D%97%AF_%F0%9D%97%9D%F0%9D%97%BC%F0%9D%97%B5%F0%9D%97%BB%F0%9D%98%80%F0%9D%97%BC%F0%9D%97%BB_%F0%9D%97%AE%F0%9D%98%81_%F0%9D%98%81%F0%9D%97%B5%F0%9D%97%B2_%F0%9D%97%BD%F0%9D%97%BC%F0%9D%97%B1%F0%9D%97%B6%F0%9D%98%82%F0%9D%97%BA/hol38zr/]]. You follow blogs that match your interests, and I [[hope]] you'll consider real people of interest to you like that too, `/grin`; might be necessary for [[intimacy]] in some cases (especially since you're nearly as hiki as I am, imho). Moreover, [[knowing|https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/r3eqqi/no_spoilers_decisions_decisions_art_by_wingedcorgi/hmay880/]] [[what|https://www.reddit.com/r/gifs/comments/r1wwl4/modus_redditus_animated_ink_drawing/hm2x69z/]] [[you do|https://www.reddit.com/r/MadeMeSmile/comments/re91mq/this_makes_me_smile/ho7durm/]], I wish you had your own ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱. Yo, checkout [[DarkMX]] (we can talk about the author, if you want).  Still into SpaceX, eh? Well, I'll be interested to see if and when you dive into economics (you are wonderfully intelligent). I'm always surprised we've never talked about [[NFT|https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/r4wrha/the_original_pay_to_win_game_system/hmkqzbg/]]s and [[MTG]]. Until next time, sir. `/salute`.
