title: 2021.09.24 - Antipleonasm Analysis: State of Faith

!! Respond to [[the following|Why Not A Wide Area Network, Watson?]]:

Faith is a state of openness or trust...in other words, a person who is a fanatic in matters of religion, and clings to certain ideas about the nature of God and the universe, becomes a person who has no faith at all. Instead they are holding tight. But the attitude of faith is to let go, and become open to the truth, whatever it might turn out to be.

You've got your ax to grind, and it plays well to your demographics. I'm disappointed in your answer. I know you've been exposed to better definitions than this. This isn't just a rhetorical cheapshot, it's not even close to a decent definition of faith. I know you know that.

[[Faith]] is a matter of closedness and mistrust in some respects as well. Under entailment, accepting P generally requires us to deny Â¬P. I'll agree, however, that [[good]] faith requires we are open to [[the other]] and the implications of our constraining {[[Axioms]]}. However, it's not clear that faith requires much openness or trust at all. Consider, for example, the skeptic whose epistemic standard may be so high, reaching into certainty even, that their faith leaves them trusting very little, if anything, and, ultimately, no matter how open they might aim to be, over time they will recognize the futility in remaining open to much of anything. However problematic it may be, that's still faith.

There are no instances of Dasein that lacks faith. You're claim is hyperbole, and it's a strawman too. Of course, we can cling to beliefs we ought not, but you've purposely misrepresented how justified faiths can be strengthened over time; we can justifiably grow more confident in our fundamental beliefs.<<ref "b">> That doesn't mean we ought not be willing to [[Question Everything]] (far from it), but sticking to our doxastic guns is often an excellent example of faith.<<ref "y">> 

I think the fitting attitude of one's faith depends on which faith one has in the first place. And, if you're going to remain as tolerant and as open as you claim to be, including your faith in what consists in faith, you'll find that intolerance is the inevitable result. 

Of course, I admire this language of being radically open to the truth, embracing a willingness to part with our beliefs and celebrate finding something better, to maintaining fitting humility, and to even accept the mystical problematics of life. These are crucial. Your argument is shit though.
