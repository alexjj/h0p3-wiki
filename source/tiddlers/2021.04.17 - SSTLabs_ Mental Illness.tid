title: 2021.04.17 - SSTLabs: Mental Illness

Mental illness is not an excuse for bad philosophy considering how batshit so many famous figures were, but the whole "TempleOS" aesthetics should be a red flag. This reads like mania and psychosis, and fuck, man... I gave removeddit a once over and this person has been the furthest thing from rude. Spammy as hell, but certainly not rude. You have to at least give them some credit for making an easily accessible dictionary for their neologisms like lore for a damn CRPG.

I find this shit as funny as everyone else but I used to be like this and couldn't understand why everyone loathed me. I still have problems sometimes. They're not trolling, and your sneering replies really aren't warranted in this situation. Don't egg this stuff on. Piss poor understanding of these states of mind gets these people isolated, abused, sometimes killed. I've never hurt anyone, and I reasonably doubt this wacky-ass has either. Y'all motherfuckers need schizoanalysis.

...

I used to have mundane conversations with myself, starved for basic human interaction. So isolated that internet comments meant a lot. Made my own friends since I figured god wouldn't make people understand. Little empathy goes a long ways.
