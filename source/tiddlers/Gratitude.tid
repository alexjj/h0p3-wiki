title: Gratitude

//Indeed, we ought to both carefully reframe and materially simplify our lives, including [[stoic]]ly imagining what our lives would be like without some object, property, or process. We must recognize when the little things are really the big things in life and recognize sufficiency where fitting. Crucially, gratitude, as the kindness one pays [[The Other]], the morally motivated behavior emerging from the completion of thankfulness, is definitionally justified. Unfortunately, there remains a shadow over positivistic analysis and egoistic accounts of the concept. Selfish gratitude as a function of positive thinking [[cult]]s and mere virtue signaling must be cautiously inspected. It's not just about overcoming hedonic adaptation or performatively appearing righteous; that must miss the point of what really matters about gratitude. Gratitude can be nice and all, but I care about when it's kind.//

If you tell people how lucky they are, they don’t like that. They guard against it. They’re like, ‘Wait. Who are you? You’re diminishing my achievements.’ But if you ask people, ‘How has luck played a role in your life?’ People can get in touch with their tailwinds, or how lucky they are. So it really suggests an ask-don’t-tell policy when it comes to either luck or [a] particular type of tailwind.

* Gratitude is a profound humility in knowing what we've done with what we've had as honestly as possible, questioning our privilege all the way down into the [[VOI]]. Insofar as it matters, gratitude is at least a function toward categorically appreciating both what was not up to us, and what that description prescriptively means for what is up to us. What ought we do with even partial knowledge of what is [[good]] in the world for us? What does it mean to be glad //for// (almost to the point of //to//) [[The Good]] [[irwartfrr]]? Saint Spinoza know what it do. No doubt, we are grateful that gratitude is a moral virtue. So, let us defend the word wisely.

* Definitions & Properties
** the proper or called-for response in a beneficiary to benefits or beneficence from a benefactor.
** Interpersonal Triadic Prepositional Gratitude To
*** Agent Y is grateful to agent R for φ-ing, where Y is some beneficiary, R is some benefactor, and φ is (at least paradigmatically) something R has done that was beneficial for Y.
**** Recognitive Respect for the person, as opposed to mere appraisal of inanimate objects.
**** Anthropomorphized objects?
**** Grateful "to" vs. "for"
***** The categoricity of the third entity in the trilectic is the moral merit of φ.
***** Cosmic gratitude "for" edges on "to"
** Dyadic Propositional Gratitude For
*** Y is grateful that p, where p represents some state of affairs Y finds beneficial.
*** Gladness, appreciation
** Gratitude demonstrates the quality (in some quantity) of being thankful in return of any kindness, help, support or kind deed from anyone. This word is used to express appreciation, feelings of thankfulness to any kind act, service from anyone. This word is a more humble and strong word to say thanks, show thankful behaviour in return of any help or kindness. For example, I express my gratitude to all my teachers for their kind support.
*** Gratitude for [[The Moral Law]], binding, using autonomy [[irwartfrr]]...
**** Can we show gratitude for someone doing what is morally wrong? 
***** Positivisti gratitude vs. justified gratitude?

* Conditions
** Whether R must be an agent. 
** Whether φ must be an action.
** Whether R must have φ-ed intentionally.
*** [[Moral Luck]]/Propositional Gratitude, Accidental Consequences, Gettier
*** Secondary Effect, Primary Motivations, Problems of Intention
** Whether R’s φ-ing must be supererogatory. 
*** If it is good but not morally required to be done. Lesser acts were permissible. Beyond duty.
**** praiseworthiness vs supererogatoriness
*** Issue of whether Y can owe R gratitude for φ-ing if R was obligated to φ, or if Y had a right to R’s φ-ing.
**** Freely taking up the obligation to do so
*** [[dok]] of owing. 
*** The Problem of God's Mercy
** Whether R must incur some liability in φ-ing
*** Sacrificial, dialectical costs
** Whether R’s φ-ing must actually benefit R
*** Intentions vs Consequences
** Whether Y wants or accepts R’s φ-ing
*** Impairing conditions; idealizing agents as though they were external to the process in evaluation
**** [[The Golden Rule]]
*** Force, coercion, desire. We can be wrong about what we should want, and we can even obligated to aim to desire.
**** Affective vs. Cognitive Gratefulness

* Calculations and Commensurability...
** Being grateful for parts but not the whole.
*** When Hitler serves me tea.

* There is a partial genetic component to one's likelihood of showing gratitude.

* Hume and Kant Agree on Ingratitude (that's not nothing)
** Sir Hume: "the most horrible and unnatural crime that a person is capable of committing"
** Saint Kant: "the essence of vileness"
** Envy, materialism, narcissism, and cynicism can be thought of as "thieves of thankfulness."
** Generic enough to have an Aesop's Fable, slave who pulls a thorn out of the paw of a lion.

* Commissiveness
** a speech-act through which a beneficiary commits himself to developing grateful beliefs, feelings and other dispositions that he may not have at the time of thanking

* Elements
** Cognitive
*** Judgment
**** Sufficient reason for feelings. 
**** What are the necessary doxastic contents of gratitude?
*** Commonality: a belief in or an awareness of one’s dependence on others—the sort of awareness typically associated with humility.
**** But, why should it be //necessary// dependence?
**** Gratitude calls not only for the formation of certain beliefs, but for their persistence as well.
***** It appears that a specific amount of weight must be attached to them.
** Affective
*** Is it even gratitude without feeling?
*** Does it require having a feeling of goodwill (and, why should we think goodwill is a feeling?)?
*** Incompatibility, undermining, or diminution of resentment
** Expression
*** Maxim Structures, Belief+Desire->Action
**** If you really believe, then you will act...
*** Acknowledging, preferably directly.
*** Thankfulness, sometimes indebtedness (Mercy concept)

* Would I want millions more of them in my world? 
** The eumemecists' moral requirements. 

* [[CTS]] as a type of [[Stoicism-fu]] [[gratitude]]
** But, note, even the vicious agent may egoistically wield the concept of gratitude. There are justified and unjustified kinds of demoralized-positivistic concepts of gratitude. 
* {[[About]]} gratitude, [[APFVD]] gratitude scales. 
* Descriptively, from a moral-psych perspective, gratitude practices may induce feelings of indebtedness and guilt scaled up with one's collectivism.
** Feeling shame in being unable find to find something to be grateful while experiencing depression/anxiety.

* There appears to be a lack of authenticity in egoistic gratitude. It must have humility toward [[The Golden Rule]], and thus justification is the only coherent type of gratitude by definition. The nature of Honesty must be embedded this far down.

* Skepticism
** One isn’t just grateful for but grateful to, which is why the vast majority of quotes and aphorisms about gratitude that you’ll find online are religious.
*** Even the "spiritual but not religious" and enthuse at length about meditation and mindfulness — have accepted a fundamentally religious idea like living a life of gratitude.
**** Mere instrumental wielding of "count your blessings in order that you’ll have more of them"
*** If there’s something wrong with being perpetually sour and discontented, why wouldn’t we also object to erring in the opposite direction? 
** The Right to Be Dissatisfied and Ungrateful
*** The push back of how we are part of defining [[The Good]] of ourselves to some non-trivial extent in virtual of subjective qualia as it contributes to the intersubjective.
*** Revolting against the status quo rather than being brainwashed into inauthentically virtue signaling general thankfulness, especially when it is 'impolite' for he have-nots and victims of various forms of oppression and exclusion, to be dissatisfied, let alone to speak up against existing conditions.
*** Gratitude as McMindfulness, and as though blissful ignorance would ever be an acceptable goal
**** The irony of consumerism as lacking gratefulness, and yet the irony of capitalism rhetorically employing the concept when it suits those in power.
*** Quelling/silencing //comparison// and envy-rhetoric used to suppress, alienate, and disenfrachise in unjustified manners.
** When life is really shit for reasons that aren't up to you, it's okay to not feel grateful by and large, right?
*** Don't let it interfere with the ability to express emotions needed to recover or heal from deep pain or loss, defeat, unsugarcoated grief.
*** Be careful about raising your predictions of happiness or low your predictions of betrayal and other risks that lead to profound disappoinment.
** Gratitude appears to be a button we can push that increases our happiness at the expense of the real, balanced truth. It's emotional component can override Reason.

* Techniques
** Take a moment to identify one positive event each day.
** Tell someone about the positive event or share it on social media. This can help you savor the moment a little longer.
** Start a daily gratitude journal. Aim to find little things you're grateful for, such as a good cup of coffee, a pretty sunrise or nice weather.
** Identify a personal strength and reflect on how you've used this strength today or in recent weeks.
** Set a daily goal and track your progress. "This is based on research that shows when we feel progress towards a goal, we have more positive emotions," Moskowitz says. The goal should not be too lofty. You want to be able to perceive progress.
** Try to practice "positive reappraisal": Identify an event or daily activity that is a hassle. Then, try to reframe the event in a more positive light. Example: If you're stuck in traffic, try to savor the quiet time. If you practice this enough, it can start to become a habit.
** Do something nice for someone else each day. These daily acts of kindness can be as simple as giving someone a smile or giving up your seat on a crowded train. Research shows we feel better when we're kind to others.
** Practice mindfulness by paying attention to the present moment. You can also try a 10-minute breathing exercise that uses a focus on breathing to help calm the mind.
