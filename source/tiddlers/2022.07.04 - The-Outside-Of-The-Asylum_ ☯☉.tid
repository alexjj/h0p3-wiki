//Giving you the [[chance]] to finish before I jumped back in. Perhaps it's best I do so now.//

Dear The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum,

It has taken me a week to write this. I wasn't sure if I should or would address the block quote (or if you wanted me to), but in [[T42T]], I think it's worth our time to consider it again. I take your words seriously. So, this is becoming a [[letter]] as well. =D. [[IA2DYJ]], [[nomad]]. I recognize it's not fun [[wrestling]] with me on this topic, and I appreciate your patience, patient. I respect that you are concerned with morality despite your skepticism about objectivity; the preservation of normativity is something I hold in high regard.<<ref "sk">> It's been an important part of [[reconstructing]] my {[[Axioms]]}. 

> I see the draft part is crossed out but i'm not sure if its actually done, so feel free to disregard this message. 

I also removed the <<tag "Draft">>from the page, but it's totally fine to respond while I'm writing (some people [[help]] me shape the [[letter]] that way).<<ref "t">> When I began writing this ~~[[note]]~~ [[letter]], I wrote until I couldn't keep my eyes open. I want you to know I'm thinkin' about it, and, as usual, I appreciate having the chance to sleep on it. 

> I hope you had a good time with your brother, I am actually going to go see mine along with my mother in the middle of july. 

I did have a good time with [[him|JRE]] and his family. I haven't seen them in years, and, it's possible I won't see them for many more years (or perhaps ever again [ugh, turns my stomach inside and out], however fucked up sad a thought that may be<<ref "and">>). I can't say I'm terribly optimistic about the world, but I do hunt for what's worth [[hoping]] for. I've been pitching the idea of moving up here to New England to my brother and his wife. I think it might lead to a better life for their sons, [[Bn]] and [[Q]].

How do you think your visit will go (or how has it gone)? What's he like? How often do you get to see him? 

> excuse my typos in this, I fell of the wagon tonight and had my first drink in a few months. 

Yes, sir. `/nod`. I've got nearly countless typos (and it's only getting worse with age, unfortunately; and that's not a good sign). While I'm sorry to hear you're off the wagon when you wished to stay on it, I hope it was still a reprieve. I don't know how your drug use goes or if there's any constructive ways for you to do so. From what I understand, and presumably you know much more about the matter than I do, it's a significant risk for someone suffering from schizophrenia. Not an easy position to be in, sir.

> My medication really fucked me up earlier this week, I had a allergic reaction and seized up, my neighbor thought I was having a stroke. Really just kinda hopeless about my situation. Medication isn't helping and from the bit of reading I've done on schizophrenia statistics 53% of schizos who are unresponsive to treatment end up in a long term facility by the time they are 35. And I'm getting close. Its just a struggle to deal with a degenerative disease like this. 

Yikes. That sounds dangerous. What all did you experience in the reaction? Are you able to acquire different medication?

I can appreciate how the odds are not in your favor, sir. The medical system is all sorts of fucked. A decade ago, I couldn't find anyone who could help me when I lived in New Orleans. Does your family understand? I imagine they might.

It's interesting that your neighbor noticed. Does your neighbor stop by to see how you are doing often? What are they like? Do you go out of your way to build relationships with your neighbors (I don't know how many are in walking distance for you), and do they reciprocate?

> Also I'd appreciate it if you kept in mind that I'm kinda dumb. I was educated a few hairs apart from the smarts. I dropped out of highschool, my mom got cancer and lost her job shortly thereafter in my junior year so I had to drop out and work. So I'd appreciate it if you kinda dummed down phrases like "epistemic hygiene" those are just funny words I gotta look up. Remember I'm quick to learn, I was a smart kid. but I don't pretend to understand a lot of academic language. 

Naw. You aren't dumb (or, I'm retarded too, and I'm fine saying that). XD. Far from it. I realize we all have significant holes, and our marbles aren't evenly, coherently, or efficiently distributed. You and I both probably experience quite a bit of variance compared to the neurotypical here. `/nod`. 

I also don't care much about pieces of paper that simply say you're educated, especially since I also grew up (and have taught) in horrific education systems. I've met my fair share of brilliant people whose life circumstances prevented them from acquiring the official seals of approval useful to signal their intelligence and knowledge to those who weren't really going to pay attention in the first place (as they largely hunted through shortcut signals to find low-hanging, exploitable fruit). You're obviously intelligent and knowledgeable. And, please, forgive me for my wordsalad and inability to construct fitting bridges.

What jobs did you have when you were still a minor? What did you have to pay for? 

> I want to buy a kobo ebook reader cause I can tap on words and look them up in the dictionary but the one I want thats full-size for reading PDFs is super expensive and I don't have that kinda money. (not about to support amazon and buy a kindle)

I use browser extensions to help with that too. They are lifesavers. I'm constantly having to look words up (and spellings too). There's almost too many, it seems, a blessing and a curse. I didn't even know there were e-book readers that did that. I can imagine that hackable e-ink tools are important with energy restrictions.

> Discordianism has a bigger footprint in louisiana, Kerry thornley was a huge part of DA Jim Garrisons investigations into the assassination of JFK. he wrote a book on lee harvey oswald from their army days (they were in the same platoon) and eventually Jim Garrison convinced kerry thornley that he was a part of CIA mind control and everyone he knew were CIA plants. 

How much interest do you have in this aspect of Discordianism or its cultural history? What are some of the most controversial opinions you hold, the sort you might be persecuted for?

> anyways, that original copy was from 72 and god do I wish I kept better care of it. 

I appreciate sentimental attachment to one's information sources, particularly the hardware. I mount my [[monster]]'s motherboards on the wall. Concrete and circuits. I feel like I owe these objects something, even though I know they aren't persons. I'd argue they are extensions of me though. Part of it is not rational. `/nod`.

> It definitely got me further into academic works on life and being. A lot of the material in the principia discordia is stolen quotes and ideas from academia. 

That sounds like academia to me, except they tend to be fanatical about receiving credit and //mere//<<ref "mr">> virtue signaling points (well beyond what is necessary for surviving the absurdity that is the publish or perish environment generated by capitalism's hollowing out of whatever integrity academia may have had).

> A la alan watts. 

I've responded to a variety of his [[quotes|Why Not A Wide Area Network, Watson?]] in my [[Antipleonasm Analysis]], in case those might serve as useful bridges.

> The story goes that kerry thornley and greg hill were dropping acid at a bowling alley in the late 50's and a gorilla came to them and said something like "hail eris", this scene is also pretty crucial to the illumiatus trilogy (the series robert anton wilson wrote which heavily features discordians as a good guy while the illuminati is the bad new world order. if you want it we can set up a day where you can download the audiobook from me if you can't find it/ don't want to buy the books. good series.

I don't have an audiobook copy. Can we use [[Resilio Sync]] to move the file(s)?<<ref "rs">> It's a much simpler operation, with no timing requirements. You send me a key, I'll join the E2EE mutable torrent swarm (if you need further [[anonymity]], we can do that), and then I can acquire it in bits and pieces over time (or rather quickly if we are both [[lucky]] enough to have a good connection). 

> highly recommend as some light reading.) and, as they looked back on the moment in sobriety and researched eris, they sat down and wrote the principia discordia(probably a very tall tale, sans the LSD). However, Robert anton wilson and the principia discordia itself explain that the joke is just how we view life. We take life very seriously and orderly when most of nature itself is random chaos. I think the quote is something like "Why does pickerings moon go in reverse orbit? (pickering almost won a Nobel prize for his fictional moon) I am a man, I do not give milk. Pray tell, why do I have nipples? And what are we to do about heisenbergs law? (The uncertainty principle) ''SOMEONE MUST HAVE PUT ALL THIS CHAOS HERE''" and the joke/metaphor is that the person who put the chaos here is the greek goddess Eris. While we're talking about discordianism, I'm going to skip ahead to objective reality and (un)justified beliefs because its just page 49 and 50 of the principia discordia, which is pasted here

`/nod`. I am as serious as they come, especially about [[humor]]. I realize that's fairly unpalatable in many respects. We'll try and join our gibberishes togevuh, sir. I will respond to them and their words with a close reading:

> The Sacred Chao

I am reminded of the Pythagorean, Monadic symbol of Henosis, [[The Absolute]], and so forth, when I squint.<<ref "‚òâ">> I am not opposed to the Yinyang symbol also picking it out, nor perhaps a third, whatever image may fit [[irwartfrr]]. `/nod`. 

> It even symbolizes everything not worth knowing, depicted by the empty space surrounding the Hodge-Podge.

Perhaps, in some sense, whatever knowledge is necessary to know (however tacitly*) some path or object isn't worth knowing is worth knowing (I think this is pragmatically related to the multi-armed bandit problem too).<<ref "cl">> Our predictive processing is often filtering for compression, and surely virtuous perception requires a great deal of habituation to avoid wasting our time and energy on what doesn't really matter enough in our contexts.<<ref "y">> And, to some extent, I can even appreciate trying to therapeutically get the fly out of the ol' Wittgensteinian ointment bottle here too.

> Both order and disorder are man made concepts and are artificial divisions of PURE CHAOS, which is a level deeper that is the level of distinction making.

I don't see why I should agree to these claims. Surely orderliness, as a concept, as a semantic form, and as instantiated in //The World// doesn't require any perceivers or thinkers (or at least not humans). This attribution of "PURE CHAOS" looks like question begging to me, and I'm interested in further definition of it too (and perhaps we need to consider what it means for something to be artificial as well). Why should you get to help yourself to that assumption?

> With our concept making apparatus called "mind" we look at reality through the ideas-about-reality which our cultures give us. 

I suggest this claim can be open to a mind like ours having more function than this, and rightly so. 

I agree that many cultures are significant inputs to our minds, but there are other sources (including innate categories already embedded in us). I'll also point out that I'm willing to stretch the concept of "culture" much further than most people I encounter. Each person is at least their own culture (and probably many), any combination of people causally connected seem like cultures, and I'm open to the claim of all possible combinations of subjectivities and intersubjectities being their own cultures as well. Perhaps //Spheres of Justice// is a reasonable concern here.

> The ideas-about- reality are mistakenly labeled "reality" and unenlightened people are forever perplexed by the fact that other people, especially other cultures, see "reality" differently. It is only the ideas-about-reality which differ. Real (capital-T True) reality is a level deeper that is the level of concept.

I agree that the map is not the territory, but not at the expense of realism. To deny our representations have any real connection with //The World// produces a self-destroying solipsism (as even our higher-order representations [representations of our representations] crumble if we objectively lack access to our own representations).

Any minds with differing qualia (we may have reason to think that minds can never be completely identical, even those that might appear so), may eventually find difference between themselves under ideal conditions, though that may require infinite computation in some cases. I'll also agree that some people don't really care (or not in a fitting way) that other people have different perspectives. I'll add that I think honest assessments of the problem of other minds leave plenty of room for being perplexed. 

As to The Real being strictly conceptual, I don't see why I should buy pure idealism, though I will argue that we must remain open to the possibility in at least our most theoretical stances. I do, however, agree that a [[Platonic|Saint Plato]] realm obtains, and is even at the heart of The Real.

> We look at the world through windows on which have been drawn grids (concepts). 

I'll agree that the conditions of the possibility of a [[phenomenology]] like Dasein's require some version of these grids. I'll agree that what we attend to in our experience maps onto external concepts (that our representations of things and things-in-themselves partake of forms). Note, however, things-in-themselves may be material and not conceptual.

I'm fine, for example, claiming that the colors we perceive are largely constructions of our minds mapped onto objective information being communicated through external physical mediums into our transducers (be they biological or other). Imposed color models often provide a useful way of interpreting some of the data we receive. Colorness, as an abstract object, however, is external to us, and that some objects can be perceived as having color are often facts that predate our observation of these objects (if we even perceive them to begin with).<<ref "nt">> Further, there are categories necessary for having any experience at all. None of this detracts from the structure and meaning inherent in what could possibly otherwise be a mind-independent world.

Our mind partially constructs what we experience, but insofar as the objects we attend to are external to and largely independent of us, we do not directly construct them with our mind, only our representations of them. And, even then I think it is more accurate to say we discover rather than create.

> Different philosophies use different grids.

At least some, and perhaps all. Some may share some subgrids in common, and perhaps all share at least some things in common. I also want to point out that not all grids are equally valuable. It's not flat, [[ITS]] (nor the one I'm replying to, and so on).

> A culture is a group of people with rather similar grids. 

Whoa. Hold your horses. Why should I agree to that? Sure, I'll agree that some of the more important cultures we need to concern ourselves with in our contexts will tend have some internal coherence if not agreement or alignment among participants. I appreciate the shorthand of common use here too. From what I can tell with my own grid, in conceptual analysis, even if there may be some things which all cultures share in common or all participants (or possible participants) in a particular culture [[share]] in common, it isn't necessary that either of these be comprised of those who have similar grids by-and-large.

> Through a window we view chaos, and relate it to the points on our grid, and thereby understand it. The ORDER is in the GRID. That is the Aneristic Principle.

That's just, like, your grid about grids,<<ref "gg">> man. I'll agree that my models are imposed over my sense data (including the nesting or recursion of these partially* Bayesian perception boxes), but of what (and [[FTSO]][[W5H]]), and why should I agree that the underlying objects are chaotic? That's quite an assumption. Why should I even think that one could perceive order if there weren't any order at all (including, objectively, within my own subjectivity)? It seems [[arrogant]] to think there is nothing objectively ordered, if not outright absurd. It appears even attempts at justifying these claims will require taking up some type of order to the universe in which our minds reside (even if only because the attempt to claim that, objectively, our minds merely impose order where there is none is itself ordered, however poorly). 

Whatever it means to say it, I appreciate to some [[dok]] how I'm wildly incapable of appreciating infinite dialectics. As a [[mathematical platonist|2018.07.06 - PPP: Mathematical Platonism]], I don't think the ball of necessities is invented, but only discovered, though on our own interpretations (that correspond to mappings already recursively contained in the infinite ball itself), from our particular contexts, and so on. I don't see why anyone should get to help themselves to denying that there is order external to our minds.

Yet again, all else being equal, I'm claiming it is immoral to look at [[the other]] person and say (or even logically imply): "you aren't real, you're just a figment of my imagination, it's objectively true there are no objective truths ([[ITS]]), none of this objectively matters, and there's nothing true or extant outside of my perception." This is the line you may be crossing with me, but I'm not convinced you mean to. And, further, I suggest you have failed to respect your own dignity in denying there is anything true, meaningful, and real outside yourself (or selves*) or that you cannot access or interact with it, especially if you will go on to deny your own personhood and its dignity (which I take to be the logical consequence of truth relativism). Correct me if I'm wrong about your perspective. Maybe I've misunderstood you. 

> Western philosophy is traditionally concerned with contrasting one grid with another grid, and amending grids in hopes of finding a perfect one that will account for all reality and will, hence, (say unenlightened westerners) be True. This is illusory; it is what we Erisians call the ANERISTIC ILLUSION. 

Depending on how inclusive we wish to be in defining [[philosophy]], I'll point out that this argument pertains to most (if not all) disciplines (including the Discordian stance here).

I'll agree that we are usually concerned with discovering justified models of reality (and all cultures ought), and I'll even agree that in no small part this justification is in virtue of its pursuit of accuracy. Moreover, discourse through the generations has often enabled us to make objective improvements on our models. Some of our models pick out what is true, and some moreso than others, and some more [[salient]]ly than others as well. Particularizing universals to our context is our plight, [[WINTCIS]]. There are some places where all we can do is make progress, but that doesn't mean there's not an objectively fitting path(s) to making progress either.

I'll agree that we all suffer from misperceiving and misunderstanding, and also that we never will or can completely perceive or understand anything (even if only in virtue of the fact that any given object has an infinite number of properties and relationships [and hence truths] about it). Our lives are risks, and may we spend our resources [[irwartfrr]]. We are concerned with generating maximally wise finite models of uncountably infinite truths (which includes opportunity costs, where moral action may require we stop theorizing and get our hands dirty), and some methods and models are objectively superior to others, some universally without qualification,<<ref "em">> and some radically particularized to our contexts.

> Some grids can be more useful than others, some more beautiful than others, some more pleasant than others, etc., but none can be more True than any other.

Why should I agree to that hypocrisy? I'll agree some are more useful, beautiful, pleasant, and even right than others, but the latter claim is another leap altogether. By this principle, any perspective, including the negations of that claim, are just as true. Cool story, bro. 

To be clear, propositions have truth values. We're claiming that a grid includes at least a set of propositions (be they tacitly or explicitly stated, believed, pursued, emoted, or felt) that correspond to a set of facts, semantics, or truth-bearers out in the world. Surely, some sets are more accurate than others, and some even completely accurate. Yes, some grids are more True (or pick out Truth, or point toward Truth moreso) than others. Note, truth isn't even the most fundamental unit of value in epistemology either: justification is.

The claim that truth is an illusion appears to be a projection of the disillusioned postmodern, as though this is all just a bad dream they wish to escape from and they don't want to admit or commit to any responsibility for giving a shit. The argument the Discordians present is an ancient cope. I think some grow addicted to their detachments, as it conveniently allows them to justify anything. It's a mix of ignorance or malice, and I [[aim]] to be as charitable as I can about the matter.

> DISORDER is simply unrelated information viewed through some particular grid.

Why should I think any information is unrelated? Why should I think this is subjective as well? 

> But, like "relation", no-relation is a concept. Male, like female, is an idea about sex. To say that male-ness is "absence of female-ness", or vice versa, is a matter of definition and metaphysically arbitrary. 

These may be analytic truths, though I'm not so sure that male and female categories should be understood simply as such. More importantly, I don't see why it's arbitrary, but I probably don't understand what is meant by "metaphysically arbitrary" either. Please elaborate.

> The artificial concept of no-relation is the ERISTIC PRINCIPLE.

I don't see why it is artificial or need be. This is perhaps an attempt to get at the the being of non-being related paradoxes. I'm concerned it's just truth relativism packaged for [[cult]]ic exploitation.

> The belief that "order is true" and disorder is false or somehow wrong, is the Aneristic Illusion. To say the same of disorder, is the ERISTIC ILLUSION.

I still need clarification on these claims. I worry the use of "illusion" here is a way to smuggle in and wield concepts like truth, logical validity, and correspondence while hypocritically decrying them.

> The point is that (little-t) truth is a matter of definition relative to the grid one is using at the moment, and that (capital-T) Truth, metaphysical reality, is irrelevant to grids entirely. 

Why should I think Truth is logically equivalent to metaphysical reality? I'll agree the truth is metaphysical (though truth-bearers may be material), and that metaphysics is a part of what is real. I'll even agree it is the most important part of what is real, and I'll even agree that it contains all necessary truths (whereas the rest of our actual world, presumably [or not, I don't care] most of it the physical universe, may be contingent).

Moreover, why should we think The Truth is irrelevant to our models of reality entirely? Imagine trying to live that belief with conviction. I'm going to point and laugh at it: I think it's bad [[faith]] argumentation. 

> Pick a grid, and through it some chaos appears ordered and some appears disordered. Pick another grid, and the same chaos will appear differently ordered and disordered.

That doesn't mean that no grid is objectively superior to another or more capable of either helping us find what is objectively true or enabling us to be more objectively justified. I'm doing my best to appreciate the [[poetry]] of the Discordian oversimplification though.

> Reality is the original Rorschach.
> Verily! So much for all that.

Yup. I've come across these crossroads in the desert, nomad. `/nod`. "Verily" is a cute touch. This is in line with what I have encountered from those who claim to be Discordians and many other schools of thought as well. And, surely, I should be accused of being a naive dogmatic fundamentalist the honorable skeptics will warn ya about. I suggest that what we're really getting at, in the end, is speaking about the apparently ineffable to we the [[fff]], and this Discordian ideology is an understandably (to some [[dok]]) mistaken path.

> I think I agree, that there is some metaphysical objective reality which is unobtainable by us. espically by myself.

I do not claim that we do not have any access at all to metaphysics, nor do I think one can perceive the rest of reality without metaphysics. I think we're innately metaphysical in some respects. I'm also not claiming that metaphysics is logically equivalent (‚áî) to reality. That may not be what you are implying either, but it's worth clarifying.

Why do you say especially yourself? Are your circumstances, even as someone who suffers from schizophrenia, more problematic or unique? I take you to be shooting for epistemic humility here, and I admire that. 

> I don't believe in axoims because I don't believe my reality is in any way true, or objective. 

What do you mean when you say you don't believe in axioms? Do you mean to say you don't have any, even tacitly or implicitly? Do you think you escape having principles? Don't you think that the claim your reality is in no way true is itself axiomatic? Do you mean, rather, to say you don't wish to engage in explicit axiomatic reasoning, and perhaps seek a way to reason without axioms even implicitly?

> My reality is strictly subjective, and any affirmitive statement I make feels like it wants to crawl back down my throat immediately.

Your reality is my reality, and vv. We're in the same objective reality. Our perceptions of reality, of course, are not from objective perspectives. 

Your above sentence is an affirmative statement.<<ref "as">> Did it cause that feeling too? Do you think the feeling alone is lacking some motivational oomph in our reasoning about the natures of truth, reality, and our access?

Let me suggest that we've all been burned alive by our [[faith]] in propositions or things that turned out not to be true or real or relevant, or at least not to the [[dok]] we thought or felt. Watching our delusions and parts of who we are crumble can be painful, no doubt (though sometimes we are [[lucky]] enough to celebrate it). There is a [[hope]]lessness in the learned helplessness of denying anything is real or matters. Who wants to feel responsible for getting burned again? The pursuit of certainty in this space is often quite dangerous and dogmatically deconstructive. Hence, I take up the metamodernist's ideal as best I know how (which, ofc, isn't well enough!). I do appreciate how expensive it is to let go of the past, to perform this surgery on oneself, and to pick and pick up one's tentpegs in the desert to find another place to put them down. Commitment, including to our words, is what demonstrates who we are; it's part of being a well-constituted person, [[WINTCIS]].

> There is too much noise, and I only sort things out laterally so the noise becomes even more noise as I try to relate it in some way that I can understand it. I think the society of the spectacle is a good example of this. I'm only to statement 69 (nice) because I constantly get sidetracked associating the noise to other noise. This is often the case with academic works. 

Oh, I live with the feeling of chaos too, [[nomad]]. Even a cursory glance through my ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî± demonstrates it as clearly as I know how. [[S2NR]] is so expensive to pursue sometimes, and I can't say I'm sufficiently disciplined. I [[hope]] you'll keep writing too. 

> It took me months and months to finish infinite jest, and I bought the critique of pure reason by kant at the same time and still am only halfway through it. 

`/nod`. I dis[[like]] both books. They are not enjoyable, and I don't think they are as comprehensible as they could be (but, perhaps that may be part of the point too, but I'd like to think not). And, surely, I am just as guilty (if not moreso*). I think they provide worthy experiences to have though, and I'm [[grateful]] I get to understand what little of [[The Great Human Conversation]] I do.

> I've been rambling a minute so lets get back to the questions

Please do ramble. You barely say anything that I can hear or see.<<ref "hm">> I'm sitting here listening, and you give me so little to hang onto, imho. I don't believe you are going to write too much for me, even when it is not directly addressed to me.

> Thats a interesting question. Most of my schizophrenia presents as very negative voices, and I remember those at a early age (my mom is Bipolar, was undiagnosed for most of my childhood and raised us single so she was very verbally abusive, although i have long since forgiven her) however, full on psychosis didn't start coming around until I was in my early 20s. I attempted suicide at 21 in full-blown psychosis but that time of my life is very fuzzy and I couldn't tell you when that psychosis had started, I was living alone and going to college at the time so I didn't see people for months. No, schizo doesn't run in my family however both my parents are diagnosed with mental illness.

Yes, sir. Do you have much agency with respect to how you might handle the experience of those very negative voices? Have your family members been empathetic about this? I assume these are painful conversations to have with them or perhaps anyone, including me (please feel free to ignore what I say).

What are circumstances in which you would enjoy or would seek being less of a loner? What sorts of people do you connect with the best? What are your personal {[[dreams]]} for living with others beyond your business, neighborliness, and civic duties?

> I agree, I think some things in discordianism I take very seriously. But a lot of the stuff I don't take seriously at all. I have a tattoo on my leg "Bullshit makes the flowers grow, and that's beautiful" (from the CURSE of greyface in the principia discoridia) I did it myself in one of the lowest points of my life. Along with the 1507/LOST if read upside down. 

Despite how serious I am, srsly: I also think it's crucial to have times where we push back against it, bask in the silly, absurd, irrational, surreal, simulated, and so on. Not only is it a valuable function for being serious [[irwartfrr]], sometimes that's the only way to survive, and I think it can be justified in a number of circumstances. I'm glad you're still alive, sir.

Also, neither here nor there, but I'm just learning how to stick and poke with my sympaticon. Any tips or resources you adore?

> 1507 was the year martin luther became a catholic priest (Half my family is jewish, the other half devout catholic cajuns) and he slowly found out everything he put his life into turned out to be very, very false. 

That's hyperbole. I do not agree that Sir Martin Luther slowly found out everything he spent his life on turned out to be very, very false, nor do I think he did spend his life entirely on falsehoods. Far from it. We've very different models of this man. I ask for a more charitable interpretation.

> This is kind of how I felt about the wool getting pulled from my eyes on technology. I spent most of my life born bred and raised for Tech. and now I hate it. 

I'd like to hear more about it. How do you think you have been born and raised with respect to technology? What does it mean to use technology wisely today? Do you think owning our technology is a part of owning ourselves, politically or otherwise?

> I can definitely sympathize with calling your phone a monster.

I appreciate your sympathy here too; I'm not so convinced most people recognize all the shades of meaning and association I have for the name. I can see why [[Infinite Jest]] may click with us both here as well.

> I think I explained the joke, however I take the view on reality very seriously. The reality me and you and everyone else deals with on a day to day basis is entirely subjective, and has little to no objective truth. 

That sounds a bit like irony-poisoning to me.<<ref "im">> 

I'll agree that the reality we face is non-trivially influenced by our ideologies, perspectives, subjectivities, and so on. How we perceive, think, and feel affect how we react and behave, and so much of the objective world that we have [[shared]] access to is affected by our personal experiences and choices. That's not what I take you to be saying here. I [[hope]] you will think long and hard about what I've said above to the Discordian authors.

> We're all just out here trying to breathe, and eat, and drink water. 

I understand this sentiment, though I do not agree to these exact words unqualified. Check out the first sub-bullet of //Focus://[[h0p3]], where "h0p3 is:". I get it. I'm a simple man, comrade. (I often prefer the name: Grogg :P).

> Aside from that my reality has nothing to do with yours. 

The existence of that sentence (and [[this one|ITS]] too) already demonstrates otherwise.

 I can appreciate the feeling that we are far apart, and not just geographically or culturally, but as though we are like seemingly incommensurable prime numbers in what we experience, at least sometimes.

> My world is flat, as a metaphor. and yours is round. 

Perhaps we mean something different about this flatness. I suggest your experience of your experience of the rest of the world may be as such, but the world isn't, nor, I suggest, is the [[FO]] experience. I'm also not claiming we ought hold the same perspectives all the way down about everything either, though there are some things we ought to agree upon.

> Also, to answer your last question. The doors to religion, and philosophy. I read Nietzsche as a teen solely because of principia discordia. Same with the three initiates. Manly p. Hall. I was a staunch atheist before the book. I believed in the neo-liberal objective reality. All that jazz. Wasn't thinking much for myself before the book. And after it wasn't really any better. Just dealing with my reality until I got to the most stable point of my life. Now, although I don't live in a house, It is my land. And I have the deed.

I am glad that it opened doors. I [[hope]] you don't give up, sir.

I can't say that neoliberalism is really concerned with objective reality (far from it), and I'm not sure if that is what you are implying. 

It sounds like you've been making progress in some very hard places. `/nod`. I wish more people were as curious and thoughtful as you.

> Yeah, I agree with you entirely, but I at no point want to say I am bettering myself for sure. I fuck up. I'm human, and it's very human in current day to live in the spectacle. I am a slave to it. even when I try to remove myself from it, it pops it's little heads up everywhere.

Do you mean to say "for sure" in the sense that you aren't certain, or do you mean something else?

We all fuck up. Yup. I'd like to know what counts as not fucking up.

I would agree, all else being equal, escaping mere spectacles, circuses, and drama is part of our moral obligation to ourselves and [[others]]. It's tricky because we also have to participate in them to some degree. 

> I know this is asking a lot, but I feel as though we are mutual friends. Do you mind linking all your book recommendations to a list? I don't really get on my computer enough to keep up with my wiki, most of my online time has been groking coversations with you recently. 

Yeah, np, we're definitely mutual friends. 

It's been a while since I've done any [[Deep Reading]], as my [[Link Log]] contains most of what I find [[salient]] in my reading these days. These are some books I've picked out for homeschooling with my [[offspring|BAGD]]: [[Books: Curated Library]]. There's not a ton there, but there's enough to get a picture, I think. 

If you are looking for resources about something in particular, please ask. I probably won't know anything off the top of my head, but I can look. I might only be able to point in a direction. I can ask some reasonably skilled librarians to help if we need as well.

> I think I am very much a slave to my passions. I'd give up everything to solely pursue them.

`/nod`. I can agree that most, if not all, of us have chosen to do or be so at many points in our lives. And, in fact, we may be morally obligated to do or be so (or something almost identical) in many cases as well. I appreciate how we both have addictive personalities, and it's obvious our identities have been shaped by our passions. I think it's another claim altogether, however, to deny we have any choice in the matter. So, perhaps you have become a person who is a slave to their passions, but that is not my claim about the type of creatures we begin as (nor how I think most people are, even though I'll agree that most people lack fitting control of their emotions, [[WINTCIS]]). I also am not convinced you are or necessarily must be strictly and completely a slave to your passions.

> I feel like this. Alot. I have completely given up on any sense of truth or reality, and I don't debate with anyone on things because of the amount of emotion wrapped into them.

I can see why not believing in truth or reality would hinder any search for such a thing. Radical skepticism destroys even itself. I can also see why debate (and perhaps a great deal of other things) may appear irrelevant and meaningless on your view. I'll reiterate as well: there comes a point where debating the anti-realist is an unworthy use of one's time. 

The "emotion wrapped" claim is a flag of some kind to me. I run into a lot of people who aren't going to debate the hard issues. Some of them have a reason I think is justified, and most don't. I'll agree that avoidance is sometimes our moral right if not obligation. You seem like you've got a lot going on, imho, so I think it's reasonable for us to set these issues aside and just talk about our daily lives and other immediate practical concerns.

> I think I agree with you here, objective truth is not only unobtainable but meaningless to any human being. I think personal, subjective reality is all we have.

That is definitely not what I've said or agreed to. In time, I [[hope]] you'll read through everything we've said together (and more) a few times. There's a lot here to consider.

> I haven't the slightest clue what the first part of that statement means, but I think regardless of if there is truth to be known, what is to be done with the truth? 

Yeah, it's gibberish. We can inspect it together, if you'd like. I also understand if that's not a high priority use of your immediate time. `/nod`.

> other than speak it of course, but what value does objective truth have to the individual? 

Do you think we can speak the truth? Do you think you're speaking the truth when you answer that question? 

> I'm specifically thinking back to kant here, which I have not finished and do not grok. But If I objectively know a house will crash with a tunnel underneath it. What does that knowledge gain me without trying it? making the impossible possible through innovation? Or a house fall through failure? Please don't get too academic with this response I'm genuinely curious and want to be able to grok whatever your answer is.

We rely upon accessing truth all the time. For example, both implicitly and explicitly, we use mathematical truths to make decisions that influence our survival and our thriving. Pick out examples of practical wisdom, and you'll find truths are integrated throughout the process. I would agree that not all truths are [[salient]] enough to merit our investigation, but some are. 

I'm puzzled by the house case here. The knowledge may provide you (or [[others]]) the opportunity to avoid danger and significant losses of time and energy. Part of the point of knowledge is that we don't have to doubt everything everywhere all the time all at once, and we can live practical, if not prudent, lives. Even the empirical process of testing hypotheses rests upon foundations of knowledge, some of which are a priori. Further, why try it if you didn't think there was a truth to matter or that there was something valuable to be done with that knowledge?

> I think, this also comes down to perception. My reality is objectively untrue. I don't believe anything I say or do doesn't matter, actions have consequences. But I do believe nothing I say is objectively true, or even mildly true. Anything I say is purely my perception, which I know is objectively false, and does not associate to reality in any manner. Its just what I think, thats it.

Your reality and your perceptions of it either obtain or don't. Reality does, and your perceptions generally do (except when you aren't experiencing anything, which may not even include dreaming while you are asleep - it's an interesting question). It's not reality that is true or false: it's propositions and representations about them that admit of truth or falsity, which may come in [[dok]].

I'll agree that some parts of what we believe are objectively false, and, this may sound odd, I'll even agree that some things we both know may be objectively false as well (//knowledge// being a significant word to define, no doubt).<<ref "i">> Admittedly, if it all comes down to perception, especially if you think it's your own, I'm not sure what you mean by objectivity. And, of course, if you are correct that what you've claimed here is objectively false, perhaps there is [[hope]] for conversation on this topic. Continuing to clarify our language may be useful here.

Do you think anything objectively matters? Do you believe anything you believe or do objectively matters?

> I don't wish to support amazon, or online shopping in general. 

I can see that. I appreciate the desire. It's pretty difficult to do for a bunch of reasons. I think it may become increasingly difficult to survive in some parts of the world without doing so, as Amazon have nearly an oligopoly in logistics (their territory may be growing as well).

> My goal is to make a used book store which I would get lost in as a child.  My mother used to drop me off at one every day during my summer break, unfortunately that store has long closed down, but it's dusty corners and hidden stories are very close to me. I've got more books on my to-read list than I do time. Mainly I just enjoy providing antique books for people to read. 

That is a helluva goal. It's almost Romantic^^tm^^. Who wouldn't want to get lost in a library of some kind? (I'm reminded of Borges too). That sounds like a really tough market to enter. The vast majority of folks probably couldn't afford it, I assume. My brother, [[5c0ut]], is a chef. His art, likewise, can't pay the bills unless he's directly serving the wealthy. 

> I have a first edition alice in wonderland, and the looks on peoples faces when they see it is priceless, as beat up and in need of repair as it is.

Wow. This sounds like your {[[dream]]} ticket right there. It's probably quite a risk to even keep that on the truck or at home. It may be worth a million dollars (or even 2 or 3), especially after repair. I would be scared to try and repair it myself, if I were you. I feel quite uncomfortable repairing a vehicle, computer, or anything that I can't easily afford to replace. I could imagine the stress of getting that right. It seems like so much rides upon it.

[[My wife]] works with plenty of rare and old books. Unfortunately, she can't point us toward anyone she knows for restoring something as precious as your copy of Alice in Wonderland. Hard to find competent people for this, I think. It is our opinion that you need to hunt for rare booksellers and [[change]] your life!

> I don't think shes right about much, other than dedication to a moral system, however flawed it is. She is very supportive, and I love her dearly, even with all the hell she gave us as children. She is a lot better than she was when she was un-diagnosed, but she still has her moments. And yes, I have a brother who is nine years older than me, and raised me while my mom was working three jobs.

It sounds like your family has been there for you through difficult times. It sounds like you've forgiven her for quite a bit, and for good reasons. I take it you are adept at dealing with mixed feelings and handling contradictions where I wouldn't be. I think this is some of the best news I've heard from you too, sir.

It is rare that I encounter people who deny objective truth but also respect dedication to a moral system. That's a good sign, to my eyes.  I'd like to interpret that as pursuing epistemic humility because you actually think humility (to the fitting [[dok]]) matters. Would you say you are a man of conviction?

> This is all I have the energy to respond to tonight. Take care nomad, also, the patient isn't as in having patience, rather being a patient. A thing to study and test drugs on. Fingers crossed I get into a ketamine trial. I've been on a list for it for months now.
> -Patient

Yo, if you give me an address, preferrably some semi-[[anonymized]] address, I'll [[REDACT]] it and have someone send some [[Deschloroketamine|https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Deschloroketamine]] your way (they don't have much, but at least two sessions worth). Many years ago, I used it myself in a hard place: [[DCK Meditation Log]]. It's been an important tool in my life. I can appreciate that feeling of having to experiment on oneself with significant risks and too few resources.

In any case, I'm flying blind over here. I can't see how you are doing. How goes it, homie?

[[Love]],

[[h0p3]]
