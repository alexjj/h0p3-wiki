title: 2020.06.06 - MJos: find the others

Hello, h0p3. I found you through Kicks Condor. Seeing your HN comments about pen pals, I decided to mail you. I admire you and your life of questing. And my dankometer, trained on you, produces a higher rating than it does for anyone else, save perhaps Gwern.

You said:
"Make lemonade and grow a forest of wisdom from what you shit out of your mind."

My lemony shit forest is my website. I don't aim to publicly self model (I'm a bit of a private person) but I like sharing my flavor, especially when I think it will bring joy to others. Perhaps you'll giggle at my parody poems, or submit a drawing to my art challenge. Do poke around, and do please write me, email- or wiki-wise.

"""
Yours,
Maxwell
