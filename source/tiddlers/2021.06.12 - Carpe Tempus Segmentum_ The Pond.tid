title: 2021.06.12 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: The Pond

[[TTTOTW]] in Art group that lasted until 1am. Dope.

Every person in [[The Alien Asylum]] was awake at 2am. It was nice. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! Sleep by ? Woke at 12:30. [[TTTOTW]].

Didn't have to worry about assignments. Noice.

Tiff. Nap, Fireman Time!, Reset. Vapelyfe.

[[Family Gathering]] sans [[5c0ut]] and [[k0sh3k]]. Offspring and I chilled. 

//The Walk//(s). We decided to mosey down to the partially hidden pond area we saw driving back to the house from the way we never come. Oh Em Gee. It's just right. It's a pond that you can canoe in (they have a ghetto dock). There's a diving board. There's a beach-like area, picnic area (with electricity?), swingset, etc. Seems like it used to be used more often. Might be private property (I'll ask for forgiveness, massa). Tried walking around the entire thing, but it's not feasible given the obstacles. We sat there and did fuck all but watch the water shimmer. We got back to the house, then I was given an extension, a short one. Also, multiple neighborhood dogs unhappy with us.

Not so convinced we should swim in it without getting the water tested. Looks clean enough (a good sign). They've not spent much time swimming in lakes or ponds. A canoe or RC boat would be pretty insane. 

[[TTTOTW]] with the adults in the den. 

Heard [[JRE]] has been pooping blood. =/. Yikes.
