title: 2021.10.11 - Prompted Introspection: Race Refusal

!! In a world where prostitution becomes totally legal and regulated, should sex workers be allowed to refuse clients on the basis of race?

Generally, no. As the question is phrased, however, there is at least one interpretation where "yes" is the correct answer.<<ref "t">>

Can we conceive of a possible world in which a particular race had a highly contagious, untreatable, terminal STD with no protection measures available? Yes. There's a counterexample world in which a sex worker, prima facie, has a moral right to refuse a client based on race in name and in pattern-matching, but ultimately in virtue of something that wasn't morally arbitrary like race.<<ref "h">> We might be tempted to say that the counterexample isn't based on race. I like that, and I think the intuition has a lot of force. Note, however, that it turns out that we're going to have to use visual cues to make educated guesses about who people are, and, of course, that must be done with humility, [[FTSO]] being hospitable to the strangers in the desert. I submit that even if half of a race were infected by this disease, without any further information, a sex worker would be justified in refusing a client based on their knowledge of the probabilities of the STD given a client's race. That's not the world we live in though. 

Again, the answer is: generally, no.

<<footnotes "t" "To be clear, on another related topic for those misinterpreting the issue: I'm not convinced that sexual attraction should have nearly the normative force most people in the developed world seem to believe it does. Libertarians are often wrong here, and it's a slippery point everyone seems to hand them without much thought. Preference is not sufficient, though ideally it is all that is leftover in the deciding factors from a range of otherwise morally permissible choices.">>
