It is politically incorrect to seriously consider the possibility of undesirable dispositions, behaviors, and choices of grey-slated underdeveloped humans as contributing to a //bi//directional causality of undesirable dispositions, behaviors, and choices in their caregivers.

Planning vacations with more care than their spiritual lives, it was easier to escape than to admit the awful truth that required personal change and sacrifice.

Imagine the spread of "secure" computing requiring remote attestation assertions from all of your devices to join any network or access any piece of technology. Embedded "anti-cheat" roots from stacked hardware, to bootloader chain, to nested kernels foisted upon us all. Perhaps it will be even more ubiquitous for files and processes to require accompanying signatures, centralized verifications, and  "anti-malware" that users won't be able to override. Who isn't looking forward to social-acceptability scores generated from scans on their drives, search history, and other surveillance signals? Immoral security paradigms are not easy to weed out. Einstein was ultimately a bad person for his contribution to the atomic bomb.

Vulnerability to uncertainty stimulates curiosity, but lacking epistemic rigidity is an immoral lack of commitment. Ofc, [[FTSO]][[W5H]]? Beware those who conflate meaning itself with the experience of it.

They say: empathy or gullibility, take your pick. That is an especially obtuse (perhaps even steganographic) claim among adept dark triads. Hyperempaths have to constantly monitor for the predators swirling around them (which is not to imply high-functioning psychopaths can't be hyperempaths who switch their radical empathy on and off where they find it convenient). This may be the Knowledge of Good and Evil, what matters of who we are in relation to all that is and could be. Roughly, predators actively want people to swarm around them, to pay attention to parts of them for the wrong reasons, in the wrong ways, or at the wrong times, in order to vampirically [[cult]]ivate and leech from their swirling herds (with their herd mentalities, moralities, and spooks). There are only so many tools we can choose to master in life, and they've chosen which objects of reality to be their subjects so poorly. That's the moral difference between using one's empathy [[irwartfrr]] and not. So, if you cannot hide, and you cannot hunt, then how do you gently repulse such creatures? Being boring, carefully useless, or grotesque must be our goal so often. No doubt, it is not easy to break [[silence]] against the ax murderer. It becomes a game-theoretic problem to signal to those we ought to extend (sometimes with high-risk charity) our trust to as well, especially under three-body problem complexities and triangles that form the shapes of all social circles. Indeed, it makes speaking in [[good]] [[faith]] to the damaged moral agency of dark triads immensely complicated. We must put it all on the line, even on the wire, to bet all that we know and [[love]] on what matters most.

Everytime someone joins my livestream, I will take a breath. If you make a funny enough joke, I will exhale somewhat strongly.
