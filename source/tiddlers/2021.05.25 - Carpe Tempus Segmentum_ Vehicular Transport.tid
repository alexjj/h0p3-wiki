title: 2021.05.25 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Vehicular Transport

Among [[(*crickets*)]] at midnight, I heard actual crickets. I don't remember the last time I heard them. We've got our windows open (it's been warm), and it's perfectly cooling in the evening. It's exactly what I love about the night. It's still and almost quiet. [[TTTOTW]].

Made some bread. My daughter is up late again, on her phone, in her bed, after having discussed this numerous times, including for the past few days. She just got it back (an irrational [[faith]] on my part: I know what my predictions are). That girl drives me insane. Pretty normal, I assume.

Looking for eviction protests. Not convinced moratorium will hold much longer (nor has that saved everyone thus far either). [[TTTOTW]]. Cleaning. Wide open space down here. [[TTTOTW]].

Sleep by 4? Woke at 11. Solid. I needed it. My boys seems alright, but I'm worried that most of the females in my life aren't sleeping enough. Hrm. Meditation. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

Wake Up & Come to Jesus Dialecture #953. [[TTTOTW]]. Chilled with broski for a bit downstairs.

Hit the mechanic's shop again. It was obvious they hadn't done the work they said they'd do, and after asking, it was clear they didn't even enter the paperwork for it. The expert looked at the problem and delivered different news than the other mechanics. Now we see why the machine was sold so cheaply. The exhaust piping cannot be repaired fully and correctly without actually replacing the Y-pipe that can't be disconnected from the catalytic converter (and, I'm beginning to see how this particular regulation is yet another tax on the poor in this state) - and he doesn't want to weld it (and I'm not skilled enough to do that either: this shit is too thin, and I don't have the right tooling). Just a gasket and some kind of glue (which is not going to last long, lol). Handed the feller my number (they said it wouldn't be long), worked on the [[Pinephone]], grabbed a gyro (everyone, of course, is impressed by my manners [EZ4ASouthernboi]), walked, found a creek and played (fucking autist <3), and never got called back (hours of waiting). Anyways, they waived fees and hands, so I'm glad of that. Just need to pass for now. We'll cross the next bridge when we must. 

[[TTTOTW]].

//Skintime//. Thinking about her day. She's a mean physical wrestler (she will kick you in the nuts and won't feel too bad about it [alls fair in love and war, etc.]). Inform the Men! Gifted again. Y u m. Meditation. Shower of the gods! 

[[TTTOTW]]. Of note, I've had a lot of diarrhea today. Hrm.

[[Family Gathering]]. Shepherd's pie like I've never had it, and what he calls "roasted food." Lol. It's good. My brother salts with a very heavy hand, and it suits me. Chilled and played a game of //Dominion// with my son (he won 91 to 76, gj); I fucked up early, and it didn't matter if he fucked up late. 

Sat and watched her post the CL ad. Like pulling teeth all day with her. Offered to compress her images and build a quick site for her. I'm glad to hear she's taking her [[privacy]] more seriously in her [[RGM]].<<ref "f">>

Begged my wife to start getting ready for bed. She's not sleeping enough, half-brained last night. [[TTTOTW]]. Finished that letter to [[Mateo]]. Plenty to read in between the lines there, and, of course, very few are going to reciprocate. I'm glad to have met them. I'm sure we will not forget each other.

Sittin' in VC for Senpai [[chameleon]] again. `/hug`.
