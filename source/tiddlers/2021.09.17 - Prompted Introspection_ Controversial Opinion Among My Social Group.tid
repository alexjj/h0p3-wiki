title: 2021.09.17 - Prompted Introspection: Controversial Opinion Among My Social Group

!! What's one of the most controversial opinions you hold among your own social group?

Controversial for whom? Do you mean to ask [which of my opinions are controversial to my social group?] or [which of our opinions in my social group are controversial to those outside it or to anyone or to the group or etc.?] or perhaps something else? I'll take the first horn for now, especially since I think it's the most likely intended interpretation. This one is a keeper.

Dunbar questions are difficult. I'm hard-pressed to identify my social group. Which social group(s)? You surely don't mean every person I've ever directly or indirectly socialized with, nor even the entire list of [[FTO]]. Not even all of my [[Root Users]] maintain monthly [[contact]] with me (e.g. [[gh057]] has ghosted, but I would be overjoyed to hear from him again). Is [[Reggie]] a member of my social group? In some respects, sure, but his understanding of me is so limited that I'm just a stranger to him; I help him with his loneliness, but he has no interest in mutual [[intimacy]]. I've encountered people who want to be social with me, but language, experience barriers, and skin in the game requirements make it infeasible or unsavory sometimes. Is it about a sum total threshold of interaction? There are people who drop out of my life who come back, and I'm not sure whether or not I should say they ever left my social group. Perhaps I need to flesh out a context to give an answer to this. 

Alright, here we go, this one is expensive: we don't own ourselves.<<ref "t">>

It's a razor that reveals much to me.<<ref "e">> There are people in my social group (however we should define it) who don't find it controversial at all (it's beyond obvious to them), but I think most don't want to touch that claim with a 39-and-a-half-foot pole.

It's not a position most want to consider in hyperindividualistic societies.">>
