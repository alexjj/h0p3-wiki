title: 2020.07.18 - Prompted Introspection: and talks and talks and talks...

!! Tell about a characteristic in others you admire?

[[2018.03.22 - Prompted Introspection Log: Admirable External Characteristic]] and [[2019.07.23 - Prompted Introspection: Human Character]] are painfully accurate it appears, but I also [[hope]] to show I'm being too [[arrogant]], close-minded, and foolish. It would be great to be shown (or show myself) I'm wrong here. 

I admire the use of silence I've seen in [[others]]. I consider it a special device. For a person who talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks and talks so much: there's something peculiar, disturbing, and even quieting about listening to someone's silence. I don't understand it, and I don't know what else to say about it.
