title: 2020.12.07 - Wiki Review: Redemption

* [[2020.12.06 - Family Log: New House]]
** Interesting to see people wrestle outloud about conventions for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd personal writing in here. 
** It continues to be a nano-wiki for a [[hyperconversation]]. 
** I linger on this one more and more. Glossing through my week, I want to think about it again. There's lots of reasons to need to do it, but I'm lucky that it can be enjoyable.
* [[The Asylum.tdl]]
** Thankfully, I have a ton of time. I don't anticipate I'll be a great homemaker, but hopefully it won't all fall apart.
** Nobody has even set foot in the attic since we arrived. It's an entire floor of {[[Dreams]]}. Lots of work to do in it before it would be usable. 
*** Saw a ping-pong table at Costco. I'm convinced no one would really play with me though. Offspring need the hand-eye coordination. Still worth going for it probably.

** That bidet has too much pressure, like a pressure washer peeling paint off walls. I feel a bit like Mac and his obsession with pool jets (but those are more gentle in their stimulation).

** Novelty makes it easy to write often enough. I think the [[CDR]]s often enable me to conjure or hunt for threads of novelty that weren't readily apparent. 
** I still have this farfetched hope that MLed powertooling will enable me to defragment and draw lines quickly. Doesn't even have to be me, I suppose.

** I think my wife the only person who doesn't think I'm crazy here, that there [[hope]] for redemption, revolution, real change. [[ridtyawtr]]. I am lucky to have people who engage me on the topic at all too.
