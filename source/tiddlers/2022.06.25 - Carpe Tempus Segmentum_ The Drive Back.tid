title: 2022.06.25 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: The Drive Back

Jitters (getting worse: I guess I can't fucking sleep when I have a trip, like so many of the people I love). Lieutenant. Apparently, I did get some sleep, according to mi amor, but I don't remember slipping out of consciousness. 

My family took forever, at least half an hour, to get their shit packed into the vehicle. `/nod`. These creatures. <3. Saw my nephews in person for what may be the last time in a while. Was harder leaving than I anticipated. 

Breakfast. Drive. Gas. No where to piss at the gas station except behind the dumpster (no cameras to wave to or give a good show to). My daughter and I talked for over an hour about the nature of parasociality. Vapelyfe. Just couldn't sleep in the car.

We stopped for sammiches. We stopped maybe two other times for gas. AC went out partway through the trip (ugh); no need for a shirt at that point. Also check engine light, but I think it's because we need an oil change (gonna find out). Overall 15 hours of driving with maybe 45 minutes of stopping. Not the worst drive, but definitely a long one. 

Finished //A Canticle for Leibowitz// as we were pulling off the final exit in our hometown. Impeccable timing. Yeah, I still struggle with that ending. I disagree with the author, though I agree that at least the possibility of suffering is necessary for our choices to have meaning (and his thesis is stronger than that, falling off the theodicical cliff into an absurdity we ought not accept<<ref "f">>). It's a learned book, and it still learned me plenty all these years later.

[[5c0ut]] and [[ASK]] were pacing for our arrival. Damned good to see them. Home. My sympaticon showed me her work this week beyond pics (and it happen). Chilled a bit in the kitchen until I could push brix. Bad news for [[5c0ut]]; they let him go because the male owner felt my brother was disrespecting the man's legacy. 

//The Walk// with my sympaticon. Wobblywork walkin, and made it maybe a third of the way, I was just exhausted. Very glad to be there though. Probably incomprehensible by that point.
