* An act is wrong if it is disallowed by any set of principles that no one could reasonably reject as a basis for informed, unforced, general agreement.
* It is reasons for action that are fundamental in the construction of justice.
* Reasons for action are not dependent upon desires (in the directed-attention sense); finding such reasons motivates desires.
* Reasons for action are sensitive to contextual considerations; they can sometimes be undermined.
* We start from our ordinary common-sense moral judgements and then refine them with our understanding of the world.
* There is a core of fundamental human rights, and there are judgements which exhibit a degree of cultural relativity.
* The objectivity of reasons for belief and action does not require uniformity of thought and practice; there can be different priorities.
* The concept of well-being has less importance than is commonly supposed and there is little to be gained by constructing a theory of it.
