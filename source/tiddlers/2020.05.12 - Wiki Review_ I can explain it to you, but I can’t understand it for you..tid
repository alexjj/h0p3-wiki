** Class consciousness, to some extent. The wealthy have learned just as much about the limits though. So far, this is not a win for the proletariat.
** Sending funny internet stuff never fails, right?
* [[2020.04.06 - gh057: Hearing]]
** So far, we've not been hit by this. Yeah, Aldis and Costco have had meat problems, but it's not been bad. I hope it stays that way.
* [[2020.04.10 - gh057: Tiktok]]
** I never know how to grow something deeper with him. Might not be able to. That is my life.
* [[2020.04.12 - gh057: Hanging]]
** I like his future daughter-in-law, even though I only had minutes to read her. I think they'll glue together.
* [[2020.04.14 - gh057: Right On]]
** He would not have uttered that so clearly a year ago. I think he's always believed it, but it's social suicide in TN.
* [[2020.04.20 - gh057: Root]]
** God damn I miss his voice. I hear it so clearly. We should VC. I call him up; I think he's too busy or shy to call or something. I don't know. 
* [[2020.04.02 - AIR: Full Month]]
** From what I can gather, he wants to be non-committal, take it slow, etc. Cool. It is my honor. His pace is the one we go at.
* [[2020.04.01 - Sho: Bleak]]
** I think the pandemic isn't so problematic for her. Not sure if the destruction of civilization would hit her too hard either in a way. 
*** I mean, she likes having her computer, but she could live without it...unlike me.
** I think the difference in responsibilities show up too. Something happens when you become a parent.
* [[2020.04.07 - Sho: Blowjob Boris Johnson]]
** She's gotta be slowrollin' me here. She has a masters in philosophy. She's not an idiot, even if she likes to play at one. I'm obviously missing something.
* [[2020.04.20 - Sho: Yersel]]
** I like to imagine she's speaking an ancient language of my ancestors. She seems to connect in spurts. 
*** We were supposed to VC, but that's up to her.

** Or...just push crazy hard on the stuff I can't do when I'm working on school with my offspring. Yeah, okay.
* [[2020.05.11 - TDL: Break]]
** I'm grateful to go as slow or as fast as I want. Feeling manic, surely.
* [[2020.05.11 - Prompted Introspection: Escaping Reality]]
** It's a good thing I'm keeping the question. Plenty to think about.
* [[2020.05.11 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Heaven]]
** My head hurts, so I'm going to take it easy.
** My daughter's ability to eat tendies is tremendous. She can eat more than I do. That's absurd.
* [[Poem: In Winter in my Room]]
** I need poems which are more literal than this. Limmericks. I'm retarded.
