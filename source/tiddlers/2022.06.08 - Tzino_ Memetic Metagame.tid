"""
[5:55:20][h0p3] I'm happy to share with you, nomad. You can find me here: https://philosopher.life/
[7:13:51][Tzino] Hi
[7:13:59][Tzino] You have a very interesting wiki there
[10:05:34][h0p3] Hello, [[nomad]].
[10:06:18][h0p3] Thank you. I work hard on it, and I'm glad it's interesting to you. I've poured a lot of time and effort into it.
[10:06:36][h0p3] How do you prefer to spend your time?
[2:40:05][Tzino] Are you into the memetic metagame?
[2:41:18][Tzino] I spend my free time playing videogames and listening to music
[7:33:19][h0p3] I suggest I am interested in the memetic metagame. I often prefer metagaming to the rest of the [[game]] itself. In this case, it's no mere game to me, and the metagaming is directly part of the game as well. It's not like the other games that are only simulations and mediums for telling just any stories.
[7:34:44][h0p3] I'm always on the quest for improving my [[Music: Library]]. If you only got to listen to 10, 100, or however many songs on a desert island, what would you bring?
