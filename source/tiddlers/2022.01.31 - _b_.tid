JOI pr0n immersion ruined by "omg ur [[dick|penis]] is huge." False.

I'm less surprised that people can code through speech-to-text (though, I'm still in a state of shock, ofc, bordering on magic to me), but the more I look at navigating and using a computer through voice command alone ([[MJos]] comes to mind, ofc), the more I'm concerned that humans aren't able to specify requirements of software well enough to generate code in most cases, and so I'm hard-pressed to think that technical or highly contextualized requirements are likely to be sufficiently specified (it will be quite the day when it can symbolize a sufficiently predictive model of our intentions). That said, that might not be a huge deal, and maybe tools like GPT-3 will be predictive bridges, and perhaps the voice hackers who spend tons of time training their software will be just fine in building out some of these domains (at least for themselves).
