title: 2020.08.19 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Report To The Burn Unit

* Woke at 12:30
** Feels good man.
* Listened to my wife's meeting and talked.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Encouraging offspring
* Cleaning
* Read+Write
* Accidentally DJed for the fam while we just took a break.
* LoL
* Read+Write
* Inform the Men!
** Relief. I marked her up.
* Meditation
* Shower of the gods!
* Making dinner...and I burned my hand good. Oiled splashed up, and my skin started to slough and bubble.
** I am persistently incompetent in life.
** I've had many burns (especially after grilling for years at McDonalds), but none like this. God damn it hurt and still does.
** I'm [[grateful]] that my family rushed into action, taking over my spot, cleaning my mess, letting me nurse my pain, running to get bandages big enough, and helping me dress it. 
** It was pointed out to me that Fireman Time was about to get wrecked.
* Oh, more bad news, car wouldn't start. Lol. 
** Son never quite found the extension cord to trickle charge it. Tomorrow.
* [[Family Gathering]]
** //Lovecraft Country//
*** I think everyone is enjoying it.
** Risotto, bratwursts, onions, kraut, apples, and a beer
** My wife brought out a treat for each of us: lemoncake bars
* Skipped our plans for [[h0p3ful Review]] and [[vidyas]].
* //American Gods//
** Instead of going on the planned latenight walk, I was just so tired, we didn't.
** I adore the scene where the sex goddess swallows her man whole as he worships her.
** Layed my head in her lap until I fell asleep.
* Sleep by 10ish?
* Woke at 3
* Read+Write
* Found out I had the runs by sharting myself. 
** When it rains it pours...literally in this case.
** Reflecting on the day while sitting in my seepage, I've decided that I'm not qualified to be a 35yo man. Despite my setbacks, however, it's still been a good day.
** I'm at the point in my life where, thankfully, in some sense, it's difficult to disappoint the people I care about. They already predict so little of me, lol.
** Also, maybe I really am still allergic to something in bratwurst. =(
* Laundry.
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 8?
