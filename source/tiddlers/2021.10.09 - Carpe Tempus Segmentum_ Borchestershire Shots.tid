title: 2021.10.09 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Borchestershire Shots

Woke at 8? Thank god. Skin still crawling, but I slept. My penis isn't getting hard for anything. Something is wrong. None of my [[Root Users]] can pick it out either (though they quite patient with me). Long meditation. She came down. Thank god. All in or all out. So black and white. Bury myself in her. She's got her meeting at 10, and we have a lot we should do today. Cat puked in her bed last night. Poor things. She made coffee, and I made leftovers. My daughter is into the swing of things, and she's in a good mood this morning. Chat about the artgroup. Food. [[ASK]]ed. [[TTTOTW]].

I'm in the pocket. [[Music]] at full fucking blast. Sweat and tears and coffee.

Dance.

[[TTTOTW]]. Went up to chill. //Skintime//. Before we headed out: sanded the table down (texture felt wrong, and it was a first coat on wood). Tape won't stay up, and nobody really wants to do any detail border work for fun, so fuck it. 

Vapelyfe. Library. Talking about boyscouts and projects, philosophy, commodified signaling processes, what it means to write about difference, etc., etc. Flu borchestershire shots all around. Extremely hawt nurses and moar. Penis did not stir though. Our nurse clearly noted that we were odd, and we acked as best we could with him. Talked about his scheduling, and he joked that he shouldn't put the bandaid on me anyway...too hairy.

Picked up coffee. First thing, since I don't wanna hear no bitchin about how they closed for the night while we were elsewhere. =).

Shopping @ Burlington. Goal was to be fast, and we were. Didn't even bother Aysia this time. I got pants. Comfortable and I even like their style. Completely me: skater grunge slacker jogging jammies with a hint of repressed omnisexual Russian dopefiend. I shall practice my squats. cyka blyat. 

We looked around a crafts store. Lots of things we want, and nothing we need. Like true rebels, we vandalized it. My son and I left the word "C U N T" from metal cutouts in a very tasteful place. Boys dragged the girls out, kicking and screaming.

Shopping @ The Dollar Tree. We got snacks, couldn't find the little bowls we needed, and picked up more maintenance supplies (also, their knockoff pinesol doesn't smell like it; I need to find the original so I can finally huff it - always wanted to, shit is cash yo). Tommy from the Dollar Tree, `/wave`, had a brilliant accent I couldn't place and a personality that suited me, at least at first glance. We immediately shot the shit with laughs to boot, and he opened with some informal philosophy with me (noice). The lady behind us offered to pay for the prepaid card (since I may need to move gas and food money here soon) since we didn't have cash (I don't understand why it had to be in cash). Salt of the Earth. That moment where you know you found one in the wild: a [[good]] person (tried not to cry). I wish I had two cards, one for each, but he needs it more (and, the best I can do is remember her). I'm out. That was the last one. It's taken years.

Shopping @ Aldi. Offspring got what they wanted. We needed produce badly. Papayas were a buck twenty fi, so I grabbed three for Som tam. I saw Paul hit the curb, so I left to join him. He's doing alright, trying not to be bitter. Still got a warm place, everyone knows him (everyone thinks he's stealing, and I wouldn't blame him if he did), remembers my face and voice but not my name or story (quite understandably, especially since his deformation makes it so that no one can really see his face). He's thin, but he's getting enough to eat, and he showed me how he keeps his vodka bottle stashed to keep his pants up (I'm not at liberty to do that homie). We took a walk. The usual and 20-hole belt (14 down to 4, oddly, maybe a schizowink from the universe). Met one of his friends, shook hands, but name wasn't clear. An odd moment of three men together who don't belong anywhere anyway. He decided to spend his time confessing his selfishness with me (his words, his topics; I'm just gonna listen). 

[[ASK]]ing. Painted the table (I think I'll be able to get 4 coats on it, which may be enough...very clean looking so far). Swapped warm climate to cold climate clothes out with her (it might not be gorgeous how I've set it up, but it works). We chilled in The Commons area, dolla sto economic discussion, etc. Munched on many salty things. We even have soda today. It's kinda crazy in the house tonight. My daughter's been in a good mood, and my son has a scallycap now (unbeknownst to him, exactly like the Elder Marbles'...obviously, the Sco-ish retardations in us run deep).

[[TTTOTW]]. She joined me to read.

//Raw Skintime// + //Squid Game//. Offspring and I argued over what a fitting pizza looks like. Ate. //Raw Skintime// + //Squid Game//. Sleep by unknown time.
