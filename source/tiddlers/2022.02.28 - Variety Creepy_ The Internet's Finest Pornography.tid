"""
[14:16:48] [[Variety Creepy]]: Hello
[14:48:10] [[Variety Creepy]]: hi
[14:51:23] [[h0p3]]: Yo! =)
[14:51:43] [[Variety Creepy]]: How have you been?
[14:52:44] [[h0p3]]: Grinding along today. Work on the [[garden]] some with [[ASK]].
[14:53:18] [[h0p3]]: She's allergic to peppers (which is kinda crazy...we use them in most meals), but can grow her own in such a way that it won't eat her alive. 
[14:53:31] [[h0p3]]: Hoping to get some dope tomatoes too (we never have enough).
[14:53:38] [[h0p3]]: How about you? How was the quiz?
[14:58:50] [[Variety Creepy]]: Oh nice. It sucks that she's allergic to them. I can't imagine my life without pepper.
[14:58:50] [[Variety Creepy]]: I guess you're having a wonderful time in the garden! I hope you get enough tomatoes. 
[14:58:50] [[Variety Creepy]]: I spent time with my dog.
[14:58:50] [[Variety Creepy]]: Did an assignment and now I'm browsing reddit at 1:26 am. Tomorrow is a holiday, luckily.
[14:58:50] [[Variety Creepy]]: The quiz was easy! It went well.
[14:58:50] [[Variety Creepy]]: Sorry, I lost internet.
[14:58:50] [[Variety Creepy]]: I don't know how.
[14:59:44] [[h0p3]]: I've been quite lucky on allergies myself. I am told that my farts are extra deadly with dairy. I couldn't imagine losing peppers, dairy, gluten, or anything like that.
[14:59:56] [[h0p3]]: Food is a key drug for me. =)
[15:00:15] [[h0p3]]: How's your dog doing? He seem to be behaving/feeling any better for you?
[15:00:22] [[h0p3]]: (I like that you are so attuned to him)
[15:00:49] [[h0p3]]: You have a multireddit you can recommend to me? I'd like to see through your eyes there.
[15:00:56] [[Variety Creepy]]: I'm dairy free, mostly. I ate ice cream and I got a zit on my face now. 
[15:01:10] [[h0p3]]: (I hope you catch up on your sleep on the holiday...you've been pushing hard, it sounds like)
[15:01:22] [[h0p3]]: W o r t h
[15:02:10] [[Variety Creepy]]: My dog has been fine. I guess he was pissed that he hadn't seen us in a long time or changed due to the conditions over there in the farm.
[15:02:10] [[h0p3]]: How often do you have interruptions in your connection to the net?
[15:02:17] [[Variety Creepy]]: He's normal now.
[15:02:21] [[h0p3]]: `/high-5`
[15:02:26] [[Variety Creepy]]: What's a multireddit?
[15:02:35] [[Variety Creepy]]: '/high-5'
[15:02:44] [[h0p3]]: basically a bundled list of subreddits
[15:02:56] [[h0p3]]: Curating a feed, of sorts
[15:03:23] [[Variety Creepy]]: I don't have a custom feed, but instead I use a different reddit account for that purpose.
[15:03:28] [[h0p3]]: (Have you considered bonding two different connections, or perhaps have a failover?)
[15:03:45] [[h0p3]]: You may find that you can manage it all on one.
[15:04:19] [[h0p3]]: (You probably aren't as addicted to your connection as I am. I want to mainline mine directly into my veins. :P)
[15:04:46] [[Variety Creepy]]: I usually don't have interruptions in my internet. My new WiFi which I got installed gives me 2 WiFi networks of which one of them runs at 200 MBPS and the other runs at 100MBPS.
[15:05:03] [[Variety Creepy]]: Somebody must have turned the WiFi off.
[15:05:14] [[Variety Creepy]]: I'm using my portable hotspot now.
[15:05:42] [[Variety Creepy]]: > [01:33:27] [[h0p3]]: (Have you considered bonding two different connections, or perhaps have a failover?)
> [01:33:45] [[h0p3]]: You may find that you can manage it all on one.

Nah, I want them separate. 
[15:09:55] [[h0p3]]: Excellent pornography, sir. :P
[15:11:04] [[h0p3]]: Do you normally walk through each of these individually? 
[15:12:00] [[Variety Creepy]]: 
> Excellent pornography, sir. :P
The internet's finest! ;)
[15:12:34] [[Variety Creepy]]: > Do you normally walk through each of these individually?
Most of the times, no. But to certain subs, yes. FoundPaper is my favourite. I love it.
[15:12:58] [[Variety Creepy]]: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/l8yaxl/what_are_some_hidden_gem_subreddits_with_plenty/
[15:13:06] [[Variety Creepy]]: This post could also help.
[15:13:58] [[h0p3]]: Yes, sir. Thank you.
[15:14:54] [[h0p3]]: That foundpaper place is visceral. Feels like we found it too, a passthrough over the network. 
[15:15:54] [[Variety Creepy]]: Yep
[15:16:15] [[Variety Creepy]]: Such random things. It brings me a lot of joy to go through them.
[15:22:19] [[Variety Creepy]]: Alright, I'm off to bed now. I wish we could chat for a bit more, but tomorrow is a holiday, maybe we could chat when both of us aren't tired.
[15:22:37] [[h0p3]]: `/salute`. Sleep well, sir.
[15:22:39] [[Variety Creepy]]: Have a good day!
