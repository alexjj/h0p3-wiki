title: 2021.09.04 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Dateday

Footbath + Water + [[TTTOTW]] + [[Wiki Audit]] of [[Yearly X-Section]]. Fireman Time!? No idea what time I fell asleep. It wasn't great sleep. I think the lack of AC sound is getting to me. I've become so used to it. 

Woke at noon? [[TTTOTW]]. I'm being rude to /r/TopExpert5455 in not responding immediately, but he will have his chance. I am not at work today (well, rather, it's acceptable if I am not).

Family hit the library. Books for my three. I was complimenting my daughter on her choices, and, of course, the one's I complimented were the ones her mother picked out for her. Haha, I didn't know. She shook her head at me, ofc. It's weird to see my son taller than the librarians. He's only 13 (average height atm). Will he beanstalk further? He's usually been small for his age past 9 months, but this is puberty, so perhaps not. He's enjoying it more in there, I can tell.<<ref "b">> Good. I know roughly how expensive it is for him.

//The Date//. She gave her Saturday to me. Quite a gift. My words don't do it justice, as you'll see. What we did wasn't anything profound, but it hit the spot.<<ref "w">> We struggled to find a parking spot in a rougher section of town to get tacos from that one broken down taco truck (I hate to say it, but I'm driving like I'm from the city now...asserting myself more than I prefer, like a lunatic). The lady doesn't remember us, and she laughed when I said I wanted one of each (well, I don't remember how to say it in Spanish, and I eventually started naming them off until we connected). She handed us their roja sauce (my asshole remembered it later in the evening, and then I immediately started salivating...that shit is good, yo). We [[share]]d a tamarind drink of some sort (the sweet cuts right through). I profused sweat and snot by the end: w o r t h. I'm addicted.

She studied Greek with me downstairs. She has a particular tone she takes for tiny eurekas,<<ref "i">> and this tone was wielded simply for translation and pronunciation (pulling me out of my zone for //that// :P). She practiced with me. I'm jelly. I couldn't do that even if I tried; I require a teacher for anything of the sort, and I'm too retarded to learn that shit anymore. Look at her go. She knows she's gonna need it, so I think this may stick. I [[hope]] it's a lifelong study for her. Who knows what she may accomplish? I would not bet against her. This is an opportunity we have {[[dream]]}ed of for her for so long (I almost went this route myself), it's hard to believe it *may* be coming true (seems like it...so many lotteries have already been won, why not one more?<<ref "p">>). Unfortunately, 72 is the age of forced retirement for full-time priests in her denomination. I'd rather she engage in counseling, bibliotherapy, sunday school, sacraments, and have a dozen ~~sermons~~ "homilies" ready to electrify (as only a Sith Lord with The Ark could) the fools in the pews anyway. She's exceptionally rational.<<ref "t">>

Finished //Over the Garden Wall//. //Project Runway// and //Making The Cut//. Siriano replaced Gunn, so she dug for a couple minutes for us to think about it. We were quite disappointed in the moves he made (and, I'm going to miss Heidi's tits). Pushed bricks, and then we wrestled about Manjaro some. Walked her through her frustrations and suggested our son must be helpful to her here (as it will be immensely helpful to him to practice this). She has few requirements, really. He did a good job.

//Inform the Men!// Blessed relief. I feasted.<<ref "l">> The more I think about it, the hawter it is that I get to bang an ace (grey, grace? w/e). Meditation. Shower of the gods! Continued argumentation about the chores that never seem to end (but should have before noon. `/sigh`). I am the enforcer. It's my job. My wife does what she can, but, at the end of the day, it's my responsibility most of all (not because I'm male, but because it actually is my job). 

Pizza and fries. More //Project Runway//. Today is pure candy, complete bullshit. Devouring evil because it's delicious. This is a show I've watched since before I was married, and I've watched it many times over the years with my family (and extended). I continue to grow more cynical about it; the game of judgment runs extremely deep (and, that too is part of being a good audience member, as all its fans know). Nobody can deny the artistry though, however unjustified its existence may be. As usual, the judges are capricious. Thank god we are here to correct them in our chairs and on our beds. //Skintime//, I can never ever get enough (as usual, I come right up to the edge of annoying her too much with my petting, kissing, massaging, and dryhumping...I can't live without her) I must have had 10 hours this week, and I wanted 10 times that; I am not being rational. I need to be more thoughtful about it. Greedy, Glutinous, and Lusty AF, ofc.

Fireman Time!

<<footnotes "w" "Which is not to say that I'm not missing someone right now. Ripped out of me. I don't even have words to explain, clearly.">>

<<footnotes "i" "I wish I knew how to describe it. Retarded autist as usual, reporting for duty. I adore this sound. This sound is one of [[hope]] and [[love]] to me. It is proof of all that matters. She knows.">>

<<footnotes "p" "Now THAT is privilege. It's ridiculous.">>

<<footnotes "t" "Though she has argued her irregular period may be coming, and I've not detected that yet. I can believe she will know before I would, obviously.">>

<<footnotes "l" "I'm trying not to be too greedy. I'd edge for 2 hours in many cases if it wouldn't make her unhappy.">>
