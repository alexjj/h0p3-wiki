!! Audit:

* This has been a month of recognizing that my offspring aren't interested in engaging in most of the major projects I think we should do after noon.
* It's interesting to read the [[title.Title]]s as tweet-mood-impressions, my shitty schizopoem-ToC of the [[CTS]] month. 
** Unfortunately, I can see how poorly these can be isolated. Many of them drip and mesh into the other [[CDR]]s, and the references dissolve. I forget.
* [[/b/]] integration isn't complete, but the fragments are there.
* Tentpegs and framing of the day, stretching the fabric of story across the bare metal.
* Handing my broken pieces to those I love. This is what stood out to me. Good luck! 
** Like I consume everything I can and then distill it (poorly).
* I've been asked for [[???]] again. 
* I do not understand how or why [[L]]+[[K]], [[JRE]], and [[AIR]] live in the same city and see each other so rarely. I think they simply find it too emotionally expensive (though I don't claim that is justified) to be with each other. They have other things they'd rather do. ** The Hedonic Mental Health tale is only partially valid, the quarantine isn't an excuse given their other moves, and it's a pervasive pattern.
* We hit the jackpot on Rockit Apples (I should have bought more and then started refridgerating them when we had space).
** Since then, we've dropped back to the apples we don't like as much. Huge difference. Our staple.
* I've seen far fewer homeless people in the past couple months. I do not understand what is happening.
* 2-in-1s weren't fully operationalized. Like, there's working machines that meet the minimal requirements, and that's it.
** My wife has changed her mind about using the machine too. Hrm.
* August is a stormy time, perhaps.
* I've met a lot of people this month.
** I also feel higher degrees of doubt of intention and agency of the agents I stumble upon online.
* Been a month of transitions for the entire family. That's not easy for autists. 
* Feels like a lot of failures with my offspring.
* My hypothesis is still: I'm too weird for people. Mimesis costs are simply too anxiously high for all but those with high degrees of openness. 
** e.g. too much auth for the libleft, assuming we can accept the quadrants and so forth
* Offspring continue to be uninterested in my help in the kitchen.
* I'm still having to hunt for ways to be a dad-teacher.
* I appreciate the goal of summing the highlights of VC. 
** I have to write while we talk.
* Shopping has still not been smooth.
** It doesn't feel like we really need to hit Costco every month. Maybe it should be every two months?
** It has lowered friction for making sure people are fed. 
*** My wife is picky/spoiled here. 
* Cicada plague! Still can't beat the bones.
* Feels like we've done a lot of watching.
** LoLvods have been this thing I watch alongside my reading and writing. I really can't live without two screens, even with i3 and other windowing mechanisms.
* Time with offspring has felt more ad hoc, off the cuff, spontaneous. Dialectures and inspecting media together are spur of the moment.
* My inability to interpret humans, understand what matters in the world, and [[Be A Good Dad]] continues. Surprise!
* Walks have been so important. I hate that I may be losing them.
** I've also felt far more disconncted from [[m16]] than usual, though I do not claim I've spent wildly less time on.
* That I still have no fucking clue what I'm building in this [[‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±]] continues to become something I believe with higher confidence.
** Striving for clarity makes the gaps feel even wider.
* No way to effectively sum up Read+Write+Walk+Talk time. I do what I can to capture and digest it though. 
** The symbols we emit do say something about who we are, even if only probabilistically. Even our [[phenomenology]] does not escape relying upon some type of language (though the completion of that computation [or emulation of it] is not something that I think is finite).
* Yeah, I think your daughter needs space.
