title: 2021.09.08 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Meaning Of Life

!! Respond to [[the following|Why Not A Wide Area Network, Watson?]]:

The meaning of life is just to be alive. It is so plain and so obvious and so simple. And yet, everybody rushes around in a great panic as if it were necessary to achieve something beyond themselves.

Why should I think it so plain, obvious, and simple? Why should we think the objective answer would even be that easy to understand? The claim reminds me of an egoistic evopsych mimesis description of genetically and memetically reproducing ourselves surreptitiously converted into telic prescription, as though any perspective and manner of living were just as [[good]] as any other. Not all lives should be led, and not all people should live. That is far more obvious to me. It's not difficult to come up with counterexamples. Do you think someone in constant, inescapable torturous pain even wants to live? It would be better that they never did. Reasons for justifying living through such a thing require more than your claim. You don't really [[aim]] to answer the problem of suffering, do you?

Look, obviously you are a narcissist; the best I can do for you is admire how this rhetoric sometimes saves a life so that they have a chance of actually doing more than merely surviving, but [[hope]]fully thriving in a justified manner. It's one thing to say that given all deontic and consequentialist constraints are met (no small task), all else being equal, "being alive" is what is left of the meaning of life equation, but it's another to reduce it to merely living. And, don't get me wrong, sometimes just staying alive is the best we can do.

Doing whatever it takes to stay alive is not outright justified either. Your advice likely advocates evil. Sacrificing our lives for something beyond mere living, making sense of at least some [[dok]] of suffering, and understanding that what matters is not merely in virtue of our subjectivity are major sources of meaning for creatures like us. Our lives can be meaningful even when we stop being alive. Our experience of meaning ought not be conflated with meaning itself. 

I'll help you out further. Obviously, most people are wildly wrong about what achievements are even worth pursuing, too easily consumed by capitalism's everseeping grip, awful at being critically reflective, and so materialistic and self-involved they miss the forest for the trees. Some elements of [[stoicism]] are correct. Insofar as you can help people recognize that their chosen ends are wrong, you might at least have a dishonest pebble to throw in someone's shoe. You've gone way beyond that though. Apathy is quite convenient. Even ascetic subsistence can make a clever ego fat and happy. Yet again, you just tell people what they want to hear. 

If your claim is that one cannot achieve something beyond what is even possible for one to achieve, then fine. I don't think that's what you mean at all. If your claim is that we should pursue our own selves, seeking our own essence (including its extension), then you are subject to the same normative problems that egoism faces; our meaning is generated and practiced non-trivially in virtue of [[The Other]]. To live our best lives requires living in a world outside  ourselves [[irwartfrr]]. What we //do// with our lives and why is non-trivially what matters.
