* [[2020.04.27 - Wiki Review: Cherry Poppin']]
** I'm enjoying having less pressure here, especially since so many of the pragmatics fall under my time.
* [[2020.04.27 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Influx]]
** Completed. Okay. I need to try to get my sleep schedule back down. 2am would be great.
* [[2020.04.27 - TDL: Embodiment]]
** Welp, I think my [[TDL]]s are enriched, and I'm failing more often than usual here. Fuck.
* [[2020.04.27 - Prompted Introspection: AADD]]
** Completed. We can't all be her, as in: we ought not. But, I'm glad there are some.
* [[2020.04.27 - azl: Out Of The Red]]
** Let's get [[naked]].

** Now I'm seeing the [[Embodied Cognition]] metaphors (the oversimplified ones) all over the place. It's not that I wasn't aware of it before, but now I'm hunting differently. I want to see the work they do.

** Give it time: I think she'll breathe profound life back into it.

** Off the ol' [[TDL]]. I probably need to spruce up the options quite a bit. At the very least, I will have somewhere to point.
* [[Font Button]]
** This needs to be renamed. 
* [[2020.04.27 - Computer Musings: Shadowsocks]]
** So far so good. My FF experience continues to degrade, sadly (but, that's the way it has always been. It's FF, and it's an uphill battle.)

** Ups and downs. I think my son has flourished more with his mother here. I am not ready for her to head back out into the world for work.
