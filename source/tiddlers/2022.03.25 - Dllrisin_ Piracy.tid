"""
[8:56:51][Dllrisin] hey
[14:17:21][h0p3] Hello =)

[14:03:33][Dllrisin] How long have you been pirating?
[14:18:12][h0p3] 1998 is when I began pirating in earnest, though I was fortunate enough to encounter the activity in 1990.
[14:18:16][h0p3] How about you, homie?
[14:42:32][Dllrisin] Oh, jeez. I've been pirating for about a couple of weeks; i'm pretty new lol. Do you pirate music most of the time?
[15:27:26][h0p3] I think quite highly of [[piracy]]. It's an important behavior in our world today. I'm happy to answer any question you might have or help you however I can. 
[15:27:35][h0p3] It's a pleasure to meet you. 
[15:28:32][h0p3] I do not pirate [[music]] often, though long ago I would download all the music. These days, I stick to downloading for this list: https://philosopher.life/#Music%3A%20Library
[15:29:05][h0p3] We pirate a lot of video, books, and some applications in [[The Alien Asylum]] (our family's home).
[15:30:22][h0p3] I'd like to recommend [[MuWire]], [[DarkMX]], Retroshare, and qBittorrent (though there's strong competitors to reason about) to round out your access to files and communities.
