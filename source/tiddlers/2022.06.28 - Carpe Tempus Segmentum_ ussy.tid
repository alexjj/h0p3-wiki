//Slither// and //Skintime// with my sympaticon. Sleep by 1?

Woke at 7:30? Forrest Gumping. Rumination. My alarm never went off.<<ref "f">> =/ 

//Skintime// with my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]]. 

Talked with the installer. Dad has been carpenter for 35 years, and this guy has only been an electrician for 5 years. Just got licensed, had this position for 5 months. Makes $55 an hour, 3 weeks vacation, 2 weeks sick, 10 weeks paternity. Says the money is insane because it is government subsidized (he picked out state subsidies and didn't realize the federal). He claims his market is not in any trouble for the foreseeable future (hrm). Recommended trade high school for my son (though, his recommendation was the school he went to that costs $35k...yeah, ok) then standard trade school. Says our house is about as easy as it gets, since there's no crawling and everything is easy access. He does a lot of moonlighting. Said he wished he became a cop because they retire at 50. `/nod`. Well, I'm glad I know more about who I'm talking to, especially as this young man was happy to exploit the Hispanic laborers around him. I'm never gonna find an electrician who lives up to my brother [[JRE]], unless it's my son.

[[TTTOTW]].

[[5c0ut]] came down for laundry. He's got the nerves today. Big stage, four of them, back to back. He's good at what he does. Finding the right people to click with him is a much harder problem. 

A wild [[Cameron Larson]] appears...

[[TTTOTW]].

Chat with [[5c0ut]]. He got the job. 50kish, Sous, American in season, owned by chefs, expanding to banquets, seemed an instant click without any serious staging. I'm glad they speak his language. Still hitting all the other stages, as the Pho restaurant still looks quite enticing. Nice to have the bird in hand while hunting for those in the bush. Relief and happiness.

Roof is done. Side panel is done. Still inspection and meter work to do, but we're close. There's a lever to turn off the solar which should be used anytime we are going to have macro-level work on the electrical components of the house.

Initial wash of the vehicle. Machine did poorly. Talked electricianship with my son.

Shopping @ W-Entity with offspring for cleaning supplies and two pies (Tau day) per my daughter's suggestion.

Washed and wiped The Beast inside and out with the offspring. It aint pretty, but it's about as good as it's going to look without a complete detail (which is not worth our effort). They are workin on the camera to take pictures. My daughter already has a FB account set up just for this. cool.

[[TTTOTW]]. [[JRE]] called. Thanked me for the gifts I left; apparently, I did a really good job pickin' them out. Not every day one's brother tells you how much they enjoyed the sex toys you buy for them.<<ref "t">> Sorta creeped [[Rb]] out, but she strongly wanted the fanless fan  (and [[like]]d the [[MTG]] decks and safely humongous rainbow swirl lollipops for her sons). He was glad to see my offspring, thinkin' about how we'll meet again. His boss finally got the paperwork through, and didn't want any further escalation. `/nod`. Thought about the solar installation. Apparently, he gave all his password to [[j3d1h]] to get into BIOS to machine he gave her, and she deleted them promptly. I know what it's like to trust people with my passwords (and I'm a paranoid sumbitch), including her (she's a [[Root User]] on [[m16]] after all).

//Skintime// with mi amor. Quick rundowns. She walked me through her labyrinth presentation (they are ordering her lunch too, pretty cool). //Inform the Men!// Shower of the gods! Planning.

[[TTTOTW]].

Prepped just the onions for dinner with my sympaticon. Offspring workin' on the presentation.

We've had some mango vodka sittin' on mi amor's shelf for years. I'm the only person who likes vodka. Made some mules. Mi amor, my sympaticon, my daughter, and I tried it. Aint bad. 

Mi amor came down to chill. Yus. Gettin' muh drank on.

[[Family Gathering]]. Kielbasa, potatoes, cabbage, and onions. Wilson has cancer episode of //House//. Nearly fell asleep by the end.

//Skintime// with my sympaticon for a bit, then I did fall asleep, hard. Maybe 9?
