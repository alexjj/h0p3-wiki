How are you good sir? What are you up too?
Apr 25 6:59pm
About to walk. Doing well.
Apr 25 7:00pm
Been busy thinking about wikis with some others online. It is rare that I join groups. Was an interesting experience.
Apr 25 7:00pm
How about you?
Apr 25 7:00pm
Drinking beer watchung/listening to music on YouTube.
Apr 25 7:01pm
Don't let me disturb your walk! Enjoy yourself.
Apr 25 7:02pm
If anything stands out, drop a link (as many as you wish).

Deafening. Thank you.
Apr 25 9:30pm
guy i grew up with
Apr 25 9:31pm
Should make a collection of this thing.
Apr 25 9:31pm
He's talented.
Apr 25 9:31pm
sadly an addict.
Apr 25 9:31pm
i set that youtube up for him.
Apr 25 9:31pm
ive tried hard to help him move forward... some people cant be pulled out of the self pity
Apr 25 9:32pm
he grew up in a one room shack with his mom, dad, and little brother all sleeping in same room.
Apr 25 9:32pm
i use to give him my old name brand shoes so he didnt have to wear fake shoes.
Apr 25 9:32pm
i also worked to buy my own name brand shoes.
Apr 25 9:33pm
i know him... too well. he has a great otis redding covering.
Apr 25 9:33pm
but you cant watch the video. you just have to listen.
Apr 25 9:33pm
the video is horrible
Apr 25 9:33pm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRkMJ5wd2lc
Apr 25 9:34pm
Walking through his account.
Apr 25 9:34pm
spent many of night drinking and doing drugs with him singing on the banks of the lake.
Apr 25 9:34pm
i would help him with the lyrics due to my great memory back then. and he just belted this stuff out for a crowed. it was amazing back then.
Apr 25 9:35pm
If you see him again and have the inclination, let him know I'm grateful to have heard his voice.
Apr 25 9:36pm
im talking to him now. i will.
Apr 25 9:37pm
that is raw talent. he has sever ADHD.
Apr 25 9:37pm
he never stopped humming, singing, whisteling. he is a couple of years younger. i truely took him under my wing for a long time.
Apr 25 9:38pm
sadly alot of the tallented guys i was important too were left behind when i disappeared to Kentucky.
Apr 25 9:38pm
including my parents and grandparents.
Apr 25 9:38pm
still mild regret there. i was a huge influence on alot of people in that 3 red light town.
Apr 25 9:39pm
when i came home for summer visits, i was like a celebrety. i had a crowed of people waiting for me in my drive way. with beer and blunts.
Apr 25 9:39pm
then the drugs got deeper and deeper and people went underground.
Apr 25 9:40pm
im not bragging.  just telling my colorful story.
Apr 25 9:40pm
It's nice to have people who care about you, throw a party when they get to see you.
Apr 25 9:41pm
by senior  of college  most everyone was so strung out on meth or
Apr 25 9:42pm
ice
Apr 25 9:42pm
no one came around. everyone was ashamed.
Apr 25 9:42pm
"trent got out and is doing excatly what he said. making something of himself. '  id spend hours in drunken lectures and preaching to the potential of individuals. trying to build them up to tell them that they too could escape.
Apr 25 9:43pm
they listened. but didnt follow my reccomendations.
Apr 25 9:43pm
some did.  most didnt.
Apr 25 9:43pm
Some probably could escape, but maybe not all as well*.
Apr 25 9:44pm
You'd know their situations better than I do.
Apr 25 9:44pm
Lots of the people I've grown up with would need a guardian angel to come out of no where to have had good chance of escaping.
Apr 25 9:44pm
Hard problem. =/
Apr 25 9:44pm
You able to stay in touch with them more now?
Apr 25 9:45pm
most i have written off.
Apr 25 9:47pm
i carried the burden for longer than i should have.
Apr 25 9:48pm
wrote a good prose on it. lemme find it
Apr 25 9:48pm
were you a nirvana fan?
Apr 25 9:58pm
I listened and enjoyed the music. Somethin' aint right about my brain when it comes to music though, so I hesitate to say I'm a fan (even though I still like them).
Apr 25 9:58pm
I would say I'm a fan of RATM: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhntof1PWVQ
Apr 25 9:59pm
cause its so political
Apr 25 9:59pm
you goof
Apr 25 9:59pm
:)
Apr 25 9:59pm
lol, yup, good sound and I like the lyrics, a rare combo for me
Apr 25 10:00pm
Your friend's cover is a great example.
Apr 25 10:00pm
i wont send you the live concernt. but post malone. a white rapper and musician did a full live concert tribute to nirvana to raise money for the WHO. few people have done covers of cobain that i enjoyed.
Apr 25 10:02pm
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7eaGcIyhPU
Apr 25 10:03pm
he did a full concert. and i was impressed. even as a purist. his humble beginings as a musican continue and he is a very likeable person.
Apr 25 10:03pm
yeah. its no 1 trending on youtube.
Apr 25 10:03pm
lol
Apr 25 10:03pm
he wore a dress specifically because cobain use to do this in concert due to his suppor for the LGBT community before it was even reconized.
Apr 25 10:04pm
lots of subtle things that people wont reconize without knowldge or research.
Apr 25 10:05pm
but  his position as a popular artist will likely push new kids to look back into cobain and nirvana and learn.
Apr 25 10:05pm
i appricate that immensely.
Apr 25 10:05pm
I can appreciate that.
Apr 25 10:06pm
i appreciate you.
Apr 25 11:21pm
spent last hour arguing with wife about going to get me more beer.
Apr 25 11:21pm
argh...
Apr 25 11:21pm
Shit. I hear that. I appreciate you too. Need to build up a small empire of beer for ya.
Apr 25 11:43pm
I am surprised you don't make your own. Seems like the kind of craft you'd enjoy.
Apr 25 11:43pm
I'm an alcoholic. I only buy a single night supply.
Apr 25 11:45pm
We have different strategies as alcoholics.
Apr 25 11:45pm
If I purchase a 30 pack. After 8 it's just a challenge. No mater my mind.
Apr 25 11:45pm
lmao
Apr 25 11:45pm
Sadly.
Apr 25 11:45pm
How I was raised
Apr 25 11:46pm
I hear that.
Apr 25 11:46pm
My parents were buying me alcohol at 14/15 years old.
Apr 25 11:46pm
I don't have the tolerance to even stay awake for too long after a certain point.
Apr 25 11:46pm
I let my offspring try every single thing we buy, and I hope they never drink (or need to do it to get through the night).
Apr 25 11:46pm
As long as I went to work and worked hard it didn't matter how much I drank. I was a " good citizen"
Apr 25 11:47pm
yikes
Apr 25 11:47pm
I use to get pints of wiskey in my Christmas stocking. No shit.
Apr 25 11:47pm
Lol
Apr 25 11:48pm
lol.
Apr 25 11:48pm
That is somehow cool, even though it totally isn't.
Apr 25 11:48pm
I want pints of whiskey for xmas.
Apr 25 11:48pm
I got lottery tickets and liquor. Haha.
Apr 25 11:48pm
I drank in front of my parents before I smoked in front of them. Even though they both smoked.
Apr 25 11:49pm
ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Apr 25 11:49pm
I would like to have gotten drunk with mine. It was such an incredible sin, like so many things, that it formed a gap we couldn't cross.
Apr 25 11:50pm
(obviously, they drank plenty as teenagers)
Apr 25 11:50pm
I did much the same as you. Escaped my first chance.
Apr 25 11:50pm
Never to return.
Apr 25 11:51pm
I spoke to my biological father after I got my degree. I called him drunk as shit and told him I got a bachelors degree in economics at 3 am... Last time I spoke to home before he passed. Lol
Apr 25 11:52pm
3 contacts maybe in the previous 10 years.
Apr 25 11:53pm
That's a whole mother story.
Apr 25 11:53pm
I am glad that he knew you moved on.
Apr 25 11:55pm
HIs loss
Apr 25 11:56pm
Talked to my mom this evening. Always makes me want to drink more.
Apr 25 11:58pm
You csn hear the cans pop when I talk to her.
Apr 25 11:58pm
God love her. She is an amazing nurse and doesn't get hangovers. 40 years as a nurse and currently working off and on with covid 19 patients.
Apr 25 11:59pm

Smokes a pack of ciggs a day. Lol. Weighs 98 lbs.
Apr 26 12:00am
She was proud she gained weight today.
Apr 26 12:00am
Lol
Apr 26 12:00am
Lol.
Apr 26 3:53pm
I'm putting on CV 19-pounds myself.
Apr 26 3:54pm
Does she deal with many CV19 patients?
Apr 26 3:54pm
We don't talk about it much. She has spent some time on the floor with positive patients.
