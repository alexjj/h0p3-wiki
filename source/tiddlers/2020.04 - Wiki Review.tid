You see, I, your president, have convinced you that I believed injecting scrubbing bubbles directly into your veins would be the cure to all your woes, when all along I knew that in fact it would not! I was merely testing your fake news media to see if they would catch on to my scheme, and they have failed to do so in the most spectacular way! Now, the whole world will walk around wearing egg on their face, a massive egg that could only have been laid by the most sarcastic ostrich ever to bury its head in the sand. You all believed my ruse and mocked me for having said what I said, when it is you who should be mocked for believing I could believe such an absurdity! I have walked away from this encounter victorious and you are left with the shame and disgrace of having fallen for my shenanigans once more!]]

!! Audit:

* It is still surprising to me how much information this skeleton provides in historical analysis. When I have to go back to piece it together or understand the context of a tiddler, this does work.
* I've been [[hoping]] to be wrong a lot lately. Keeps coming up.
* My god, [[Captain Fantastic]] was fantastic!
** Though it is not as rewatchable as I'd like. I don't know what that entails.
* My son's humor does continue to grow here. 
* I can tell it's been an intense month for everyone, but it generally is.
* I feel like I've done a good job of capturing afterthoughts, spillover, association, and tangents. Sinew.
* I feel like I've connected with a lot of people this month. 
** Amped by CV19's effects on everyone's lives.
* I've relied heavily upon this log to tame my procrastination. 
* The Chatlog commentary is heavy!
