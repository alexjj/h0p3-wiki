title: 2020.07.14 - Prompted Introspection: Composing Music

!! What occupation do you think would be fascinating?

Yeah, [[2019.07.14 - Prompted Introspection: Fascinating Occupation]] is fine, but surely there are fascinating real occupations to consider nevertheless. I appreciate not trying to get my [[hope]]s up more than I should, and I remember how I felt when I wrote the last the time. I was understandably frustrated.

Composing [[music]] for a living sounds amazing. I think it would be far, far too much work, and I doubt I'd get to just explore as I'd like. I suspect that composition will eventually just boil down to having taste that picks out of ML streams. I couldn't have this occupation; I'm simply not skilled enough, and I don't think I could invest myself like that in the art. This is an answer for Lady Melisandre snapping her fingers.
