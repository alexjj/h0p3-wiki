*[[Goodness]]
** =(. That's not good.
*[[WOOP-ing]]
** I think your times in your planning are wrong. For example, the bathroom can be done in 5 minutes flat. I agree that your chores can be accomplished in a short space of time though.
** I like this "WOOP" method. I hope to see you use it more often.
*** It might take quite a bit of time the first few tries, but with practice, it will become easier. Maybe you should "WOOP" on "WOOP."
*[[2020.05.25 – Wiki Review: Trash]]
** You didn't rename. It's weird to see you call it trash and not take the advice to make it less trashy. You don't care that it's trash in that case. 
** There is a gap between you and your sister. I suggest that over decades, she'll find it incredibly difficult to find a friend as close as you. The fact is that even my own wife cannot see or hear me in the way that my brothers can in particular spaces, aspects, or manners. Siblings make unique friends.
*** There's also a verbal and social difference that has snowballed over the years. I think you'll catch up in many respects. Two years is still a significant proportion of your lives at this point. Think about the difference between who you are now and who you were in 2018. It's night and day different. When you are 40, 2 years will be a much smaller percentage, and further, your plasticity will plummet and development will have slowed down. 
*** It is also pretty common for siblings to attempt to generate this space. From my perspective, you are obviously still her best friend, even if she doesn't feel that way. What you may be seeing is that she seeks the approval of Pots more than she seeks yours, but that is not the same thing (and, even that claim is not obviously true).
*[[2020.05.25 – TDL: Weeeeeeeeeee]]
** Cut the checklist out.
** You have a joke in here. =D. Good.
*[[2020.05.25 – Prompted Introspection: Lottery]]
** I don't like lottery questions either. It's important to know what you would aim to do with that much power (and important to understand how larger communities with that much power ought to function and toward what end), but it's not something worth dwelling on too often. It's not realistic enough.
*[[2020.05.25 – Carpe Diem: Still negative]]
** Why are you damn sure about that? What justifies your belief?
** Yeah, that breakdown was scary and sad. I don't have control of that. It's up to you. I appreciate what it's like to be there though.
*** //This too shall pass//. 
*** I'm glad you wrote about it. 
*[[2020.05.25 – Antipleonasm Analysis: "bad guys"]]
** There are a ton of transitions, small wording and phrasing problems, and gotchas to consider. 
** Parts of your argument are either incoherent or not well motivated. I'm just going to point them out in person here.
** I wish you would actually change the problems I've picked out. You need to practice.
** Your overall claim is correct. You might wish to question why someone like Reagan would even make this claim. It may be useful to provide some context to it in this case.
*[[Notage Ti.24: Towels]]
** ? What do you mean by these?
** It can be a good idea to flesh out, digest, revise, or even build something else from your older notes. You don't leave yourself much to work with here.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** Years from now, you might not be able to name in [[2017.05.26 -- Writing Log]] from memory.
** There's some interesting bits you've captured. I don't know how to name it properly. It's definitely human.
