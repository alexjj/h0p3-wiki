!! How easy is it for you to orgasm?

That depends (surprise!). There are some orgasms that took less than two minutes this year, but those are quite rare. Some have taken two hours, but those are quite rare. I edge, and I've trained my body for it at this point. The build-up is considerable for me. I'm below the threshold for anorgasmia, but my habits, my weight, my wandering mind, my respiratory system, anxiety+depression, my age, the sheer number of orgasms that I tend to have in a given 24-hour period can all contribute to me having a harder time getting off. I'm pushing rope to shoot rope more this year, but I'm averaging 2-3 orgasms a day; surely I should not predict it would be easy. There are times I can't get off how I want to get off (inside, duh), and the inability to get off at all is rare (but more common in the past year than the previous, and so on). Easy for whom? I probably take too much time and energy in the eyes of most. Easiness is not what I'm after though; I'm gonna wear it out! Sometimes I'm just trying to get it out of the way (hard to concentrate), but I [[hope]] to cum harder than I've ever cum before every time. I think it's easy enough that I can spend that resource asymmetrically for more pleasure.
