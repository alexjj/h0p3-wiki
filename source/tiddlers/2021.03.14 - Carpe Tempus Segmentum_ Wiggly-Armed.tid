title: 2021.03.14 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Wiggly-Armed

My Intruder appeared, in the black of night. Bro came down to vape some. He kissed me when he saw my screen move and went upstairs.

Apparently, I'm supposed ''to*'' write here. Hrm. Mmmmmmmmmmmm. What should I say? 

I didn't get to sleep until maybe 8am. I danced to music while writing how I felt to [[kicks]]. I think I've got the narcissistic grandiosity tone down. 

Sweet baby jesus, that sleep (maybe 6 hours?). A naked person jumped into bed with me, said it was my final shot. The first I heard of it! Of course, I took it. Literally Inform the Men! Still had my sleeping mask on, and it was da bes. I laid there in a pulverized heap. That is how I want to die. Shower of the gods!

[[Family Time]] @ 3:30ish? Far less structured this round. Apparently, I am like my pee: sterile and gross. [[k0sh3k]] handled the [[TTP]]s (much nicer than what I have to say), diplomatic, forgiving, and so on. The gap between their potential and the actual choices made are huge. Doing what we can. I made a quick Shells and Cheese meal. We read at different paces, no doubt, asked questions, commented (mine being lengthier this week than usual since curling up). More maymays than usual, Signal groupchat is seeing far more use. It was fast, and we decided to draft instead of walk (well, the girls decided they didn't want to go out :P).

I've received letters from [[Sho]] and [[MJos]]. I'm touched.  

Cubedrafted, the four of us. I drafted in the open (after everyone agreed that the information losses with each other they would suffer was acceptable [not like anyone is going to make those inferences yet anyway {I would be a very poor teacher of that too}]). Everyone seemed to do a solid job from what I can see (though my daughter's surprisingly weaker than I predicted it would be; I must be missing something). I went Bant (Gwu, in this case) Control. Son's deck looks pretty scary, and he's Bant as well. Because artifacts continue to dominate in our cube, green keeps looking hawter and I continue to place higher and higher weight on universal type board control. Could have splashed for a nice burn set and Hull Breach and Electrolyze, but the coloration requirements are just too high (and the best decks just don't play a lot of creatures [nor creatures in reach of burn] in this cube [and, hence the extremely high priority on wincons]).
