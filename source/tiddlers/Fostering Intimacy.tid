title: Fostering Intimacy

//Social proximity is [[good]] for us, and it is even our duty to cultivate it in many cases.<<ref "c">> Can you honestly and safely be your vulnerable, mutable self with [[The Other]]? Do you justifiably trust them to sacrifice for you, to listen, and to delicately handle and bond with your proverbial soul? Do you have [[Root Users]] who you know will charitably interpret, understand, advise, and shape you in dialectics? Passively seeking a high quantity of surface acquaintances is easy; intentionally cultivating the quality of deep familial relationships is hard. Wisely spend your emotional spoons, leisure time, capital, Dunbar Numbers, and lives together.//

To become intoxicated nothing but weakness is required, but truly aesthetic listening is an art in itself [and truly moral listening a golden-ruled non-positivistic virtue in The Fitting Techne toward the ends in themselves].

Grandeur progresses in the world in proportion to the deepening of intimacy.

...two things cannot rightly be put together without a third; there must be some
bond of union between them. And the firmest bond is that which makes the most
complete fusion of itself and the things it combines...
