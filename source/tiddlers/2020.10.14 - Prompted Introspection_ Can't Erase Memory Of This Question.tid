title: 2020.10.14 - Prompted Introspection: Can't Erase Memory Of This Question

!! What is a memory you would like to erase?

Any variation of this question. My memory of it will be both externalized in the wiki and through practice internalized. I think the question reminds me of "quit hitting yourself," or someone jabbing their fingers into your wound asking if it hurts, or picking up dogshit with a bag (or a wearing a condom during sex). Don't freak out now!

If it turns out that one is justified in wanting to erase it, then through spaced repetition and the experience of answering this question, one might lose that ability. Unfortunately, I think this is part of story-telling more generally in our lives. We have to have an account, even in the places where we could reasonably prefer not to have one.

Oh, look at that, you already asked it: [[2020.01.14 - Prompted Introspection: Forget The Time]]. I had a feeling, so I looked for it. Much cooler answer before. I tried throwing this question away, and it came back. Son of a bitch. I guess I keep it then.
