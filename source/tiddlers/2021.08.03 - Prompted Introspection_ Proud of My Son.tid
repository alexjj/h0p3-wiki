Okay. I'm not going to pick out the "most" because it becomes too general.

I'm proud of my son. We should both be proud of him. We both worked for his existence. We've been through hell and back together. He made the curve. Most people have strongly disliked my son because of his not high-functioning autism (not sure how to draw the lines). He required interpreters, and even most extended family found him draining (couldn't stand to be in the same room with him for more than a few minutes). People dismissed him as a retard, and certainly did not look for [[The Other]] in him. We have fought ferociously to climb mountains, and he doesn't hate himself or self-harm. He did good, and I'm glad to have been of use to him. 

Today, he's sufficiently articulate (again, almost nobody has any idea how hard he has worked), has good instincts in some crazy hard places ([[Saint Plato]], Saint Hegel, Saint Gödel, and especially Saint Kant would adore my son<<ref "i">>), he's kind (lookin' out for his sister and especially friendly to strangers<<ref "e">>). He does his chores, often his schoolwork these days (`/fistbump`), and pulls his weight in the household. He's a good person, a citizen of Humanity.

This ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 serves many purposes, and one of the key functions is in virtue of my {[[Axiom]]}, to [[Be A Good Dad]] to [[my son|1uxb0x]]. How can I teach a barely functioning autistic person to understand the human condition? I do not know. But, I have raced to find my son in the wilderness, and I found him.
