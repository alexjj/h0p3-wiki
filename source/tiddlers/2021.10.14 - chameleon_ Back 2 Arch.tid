I bit the bullet. I'm going back to Arch, haha. Tomorrow I'll tell you all about it :D
My RGM miiiiiight end up looking a lot like yours

Was so happy to see this, lol
Hawt! =)
Spare no details. I want to know how you're doing it and why.
Messaging you from arch now~

here's a relatively lazy scrot
Gonna send out an article on the wiki soontm
Lookin' gorgeous!
We'll have to do the full tour at a time I'm not working, haha
I would adore that.
Even the little things or experiments would be interesting to me.
It'll be something the young ones think about too.
I see you have basically a full command history on the install!
for your m16
Mine probably won't be that detailed. But I would like to share my scripts (those that aren't already checked into neo-dotfiles)
That makes sense.
My zsh setup is far lazier. No manager, no packages, just a symlink into neo-dotfiles, haha
You are probably are doing it a better way, or at least one that we should think about.
I don't tend to have my system survive this long.
Usually, I start from scratch every once in a while.
Maybe it's time to try again here soon. I don't know. I think I'm getting lazier each passing year. =D.
Pinephone is the beast that really needs some work instead.
(In case I should say it: 500 error on wiki.waifu.haus/private/)
yes, I noticed that just now
thanks for confirming it's not just me
Hydrus looks pretty damn useful.
Hydrus is very cool but very fiddly
I bounced off it last time I tried it, back in 2014
Would like to try and get the entirety of waifu pictures from dan & gelbooru imported. would be a good way to have a more organized collection than the current big bucket of images
though, of course, I'd like to hold onto that big bucket for the time being
I could imagine a tag-based file system would solve a lot of problems.
Haven't tried or seen anything I adore there though.
Do you feel the difference with alacritty?
Well, I don't do very much that requires high terminal throughput
it's very snappy, but I couldn't tell you if that was an objective change
new terminals open up and are ready to use just about instantly
Could just be the hawtness that Is Mahadeva.
It's a fine terminal, anyway
Yeesssss, this computer kicks ass
I've been... enthusing about it, lol

I actually made TWO utilities
https://github.com/japanoise/uexplore is the other one
Rune is the perfect word for it.
re: hydrus, looks like it'll be good for importing waifu folder too!
