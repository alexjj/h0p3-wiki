I'm not advocating this, but I think it's worth looking at: https://grow.google/certificates/
Jul 14 12:23am
Thanks!
Jul 14 12:23am

Yo, checking in: how are you doing?
Jul 17 12:53pm
Iâ€™m alright just learning how to take time to recover
Jul 17 1:10pm
Yes, ma'am.
Jul 17 1:10pm
Iâ€™m not feeling the best today so Iâ€™m watching Selma and staying of social media
Jul 17 1:10pm
All while social distancing ha
Jul 17 1:10pm
From everyone even parents who believe Trump is a good president...beyond crushed
Jul 17 1:10pm
I wanna protest everyday
Jul 17 1:11pm
I cannot imagine.
Jul 17 1:11pm
My dad just asked me why I am concerned about COVID when talking about going to see my grandma in another state.
Jul 17 1:11pm
Ummmm ðŸ¤¨ I said thereâ€™s not even a response to that
Jul 17 1:12pm
However I do say allahu akbar very often
Jul 17 1:12pm
lmao
Jul 17 1:12pm
Ha and then watch cnn loud enough for them to hear the truth
Jul 17 1:13pm
However my mom said oh Trevor Noah is taking DJT out of context ummmm how can he
Jul 17 1:13pm
Lawd. I love you. You have this impossible task of civilizing.
Jul 17 1:13pm
DJT is Trump by the way
Jul 17 1:13pm
Thanks I love yâ€™all as well
Jul 17 1:14pm
Howâ€™s your fam?
Jul 17 1:14pm
Of course. I often joke about listening to DJ Trump.
Jul 17 1:14pm
Honestly it makes me miss [[REDACTED]]
Jul 17 1:14pm
The openness we had to talk about politics was what Iâ€™ve always dreamed of
Jul 17 1:14pm
But ya the bad out weights the good so no matter how much I miss him not going back even though my mom keeps asking if Iâ€™ve talked to him.
Jul 17 1:15pm
Like WTF
Jul 17 1:15pm
Lol
Jul 17 1:15pm
I only call him DJT
Jul 17 1:15pm
I never claimed him as President
Jul 17 1:15pm
Hope yâ€™all are well!
Jul 17 1:15pm
We are doing well enough.
Jul 17 1:16pm
My offspring are being lazy AF, not doing their work.
Jul 17 1:16pm
Stressful.
Jul 17 1:16pm
Oh wow
Jul 17 1:16pm
[[k0sh3k]] is on her period, and it's raining (she gets migraines). Work has been stressful for her. She's got a bookclub tonight though, and I'm hoping that will be relaxing and fun for her (she needs it).
Jul 17 1:16pm
Tell them that I canâ€™t write them a bomb ass reference if they donâ€™t
Jul 17 1:16pm
I watched the first season of //Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj//. Thank you for the recommendation.
Jul 17 1:16pm
lol, done.
Jul 17 1:17pm
Oh wow thatâ€™s terrible tell her Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™ve been out of touch
Jul 17 1:17pm
Oh yeah heâ€™s hilarious and important to the brown community
Jul 17 1:17pm
He and Trevor Noah are the only people keeping me sane and the check ins from you all
Jul 17 1:18pm
I reached out to Dr Edmonds finally and she said a lot of encouraging things and sent me an article to read and a book while also giving me some insight and all the while saying sheâ€™d be a delighted to be my reference honestly from being terrified of her and wanting her approval I guess I at least succeeded in that
Jul 17 1:20pm
I havenâ€™t figured out how to respond ya thatâ€™s probably rude
Jul 17 1:20pm
But I want to craft a scholarly response
Jul 17 1:20pm
I have no doubt she would be honored to be your reference.
Jul 17 1:21pm
It's always weird trying to write to scholars. I despise trying to write to English majors in particular. Can't get my grammar right to save my life.
Jul 17 1:21pm
You know I wish I could have said that when I graduated
Jul 17 1:21pm
I'm a country boy, lol.
Jul 17 1:21pm
Hahaha see I am not
Jul 17 1:21pm
So she deeply rooted in me the most important thing is how to craft an email for it to get noticed
Jul 17 1:22pm
Btw, I was born in The Windy City. I lived in Humboldt Park.
Jul 17 1:22pm
Iâ€™m still scared of her haha
Jul 17 1:22pm
Some of my best teachers were terrifying.
Jul 17 1:22pm
Itâ€™s not like fear but I just want to be her
Jul 17 1:22pm
You should keep in touch with her.
Jul 17 1:23pm
I know thatâ€™s weird but she was a literally Encyclopedia of into
Jul 17 1:23pm
*ifo
Jul 17 1:23pm
Info
Jul 17 1:23pm
Oh wow thatâ€™s a tough neighborhood now in Chi
Jul 17 1:23pm
Lol I figured you were a Midwestern
Jul 17 1:23pm
Yeah, it was rough back in the 80's too.
Jul 17 1:23pm
Yeah I bet and I lived in Avondale, Brownsville, Little Italy, and the South Loop (the sketchy side and the downtown side)
Jul 17 1:24pm
I miss it there
Jul 17 1:24pm
To me I felt my most comfortable in Chicago
Jul 17 1:25pm
I miss the food.
Jul 17 1:25pm
I just wonder what Dr Edmonds reads to stay ahead of all of us
Jul 17 1:25pm
And how she never taught with her own bias
Jul 17 1:25pm
Ah, she definitely taught with her own bias. =)
Jul 17 1:26pm
Like think of the preparation that went into each lecture and she never made a ppt
Jul 17 1:26pm
Hahaha
Jul 17 1:26pm
I wish I could agree
Jul 17 1:26pm
Sit in her room with me. I'll find it for you.
Jul 17 1:26pm
It was all discussion based she presented facts and then we had to read hundreds of pages just to bring an argument up
Jul 17 1:26pm
And it had to be rooted in the text
Jul 17 1:27pm
https://philosopher.life/#Bias
Jul 17 1:27pm
Hahaha I will read it
Jul 17 1:27pm
See I miss the bar scene and the capacity to live out loud how you want to without the question of your neighbors
Jul 17 1:27pm
I can pick texts that will drive the narrative I want in a classroom. I can interpret them in a lot of different ways. I'm sure that her bias is toward finding the truth and picking out what is salient though.
Jul 17 1:28pm
4 years in Milligan versus 4 years in Chicago
Jul 17 1:28pm
Yeah I get that
Jul 17 1:28pm
Chicago is far more interesting than TN.
Jul 17 1:28pm
I'm a hikikomori though; just give me gigabit interwebs, and I'll be okay.
Jul 17 1:29pm
I would have not been as nurtured in class but I sure would have made better connections had I gone to undergrad in Chicago
Jul 17 1:29pm
As much as I love Dr. E
Jul 17 1:29pm
I kinda towards the end didnâ€™t feel challenged enough
Jul 17 1:29pm
Like Junior Year onward
Jul 17 1:30pm
I think itâ€™s because it was hard to stay unbiased while teaching the history we were living
Jul 17 1:30pm
I appreciate that. I would argue that Milligan isn't in the same league as UoC (though, I have some savage feelings about elite schools too, Yale included).
Jul 17 1:31pm
Lol obvi
Jul 17 1:31pm
I wouldnâ€™t take advice from you if you didnâ€™t
Jul 17 1:32pm
Lol nor will it ever be
Jul 17 1:32pm
Btw, I enjoy piracy, and I would be happy to try to get whatever you want. Hand me lists, and I'll hunt down what I can for you.
Jul 17 1:32pm
I wouldnâ€™t publicly talk about Milligan ever
Jul 17 1:32pm
Ah well Iâ€™ll definitely think about that list ha
Jul 17 1:33pm
Dr. Eâ€™s advice was to look into contact tracing centers for jobs
Jul 17 1:33pm
I was kinda speechless at that point but not really surprised
Jul 17 1:33pm
Also, I'm bad at finding music for myself, and I am grateful for recommendations of songs that stand out to you. Never hesitate to send me a song you think I should hear, please.
Jul 17 1:53pm
Jon Bellion you should watch how he makes his music on YouTube
Jul 17 1:54pm
All of his stuff is deep but stupid deep is incredible and each piece is a piece of art
Jul 17 1:54pm
As is Mac Millerâ€™s work
Jul 17 1:54pm
And logic
Jul 17 1:54pm
I also like Post Malone and how he writes about heâ€™s own struggles
Jul 17 1:55pm
All of these artists are what got me through college and the pain I experienced in Chicago plus they have grown with me
Jul 17 1:55pm
Happy to help and Iâ€™m serious about those references for your kids ha
Jul 17 1:56pm
Iâ€™ll be important in some field at some point ha
Jul 17 1:56pm
Gracias.
Jul 17 1:58pm
This Logic feller, boy, he knows what it do.
Jul 17 1:59pm
De nada
Jul 17 1:59pm
Theyâ€™ve all spoken out against police brutality as well so thatâ€™s why they maintain my support
Jul 17 1:59pm
And Billie Ellish
Jul 17 2:00pm
And Cardi B
Jul 17 2:00pm
Lol
Jul 17 2:00pm
I figured Iâ€™d throw those in working in a south side Chicago school rooted me closer to rap music even though Iâ€™ve listened to it for years ha
Jul 17 2:01pm

Hey, [[MWGhandi]]! This is [[j3d1h]], checking if I got the right number-

Absolutely this is me!
[[MWGhandi]]

Hello! So I know school isn't fun and it's more fun to procrastinate and obvi y'all are advanced more than most kids your age but do me a favor and keep advancing your school work and I'll make sure you have a seat on any board of a company I run and work at!

I know ya don't know me but it's worth putting in the effort and trust me parents are always going to be frustrating no matter how cool they are but [[j3d1h]] you ahve some incredible parents! Trust me I'm trying to dismantle my own parent's skewed view
<<<

I hope this helps a tad
Jul 17 2:13pm
Also no matter where I live be it India, London, Honduras, or Chicago yâ€™all are welcome!
Jul 17 2:13pm
Even if ya just wanna send the kids
Jul 17 2:13pm
Hrm. I hadn't even thought about that. You might consider http://www.lse.ac.uk/.
Jul 17 2:21pm
Presumably, grad school for the next year is a terrible idea, but shooting for the year after may be more reasonable.
Jul 17 2:22pm
Yeah valid
Jul 17 2:22pm
The crazy part about this is that Dr Thomas said I should go there
Jul 17 2:23pm
As well
Jul 17 2:23pm
That place is no joke.
Jul 17 2:23pm
Iâ€™ve looked into it twice
Jul 17 2:23pm
I really want to go itâ€™s just getting my records into British standards
Jul 17 2:23pm
Oh yeah Iâ€™d love to go and be a part of that
Jul 17 2:24pm
Thatâ€™s where Malala graduated
Jul 17 2:24pm
Iâ€™d love to get more insight of how to get in ha
Jul 17 2:25pm
Itâ€™s a 4 percent acceptance
Jul 17 2:25pm
Thereâ€™s also one in India
Jul 17 2:26pm
Hopefully I didnâ€™t create a problem with [[j3d1h]]
Jul 17 2:26pm
If you don't go the data science route long-term, I'd plan on applying to a bunch of grad schools. You really want them to pay you for it (and, you still might have to take loans out). While I don't recommend academia, I am convinced that a good grad school is worth your time. [[k0sh3k]] and I ended up applying to a variety of programs, and I'm glad we did that. Acceptance rates going to be low for high-end, non-professional degrees (and you may want to have everything lined up by the December after next for some of these programs).
Jul 17 2:32pm
Thanks for the support and advice
Jul 17 2:35pm
Iâ€™m leaning towards public policy with an emphasis on analytics and international policy
Jul 17 2:36pm
Because thatâ€™s what has always fascinated me
Jul 17 2:36pm
I always wanted to work with the UN or at a big enough NGO to lobby
Jul 17 2:36pm
Plus Iâ€™m learning Arabic and Hindi more in-depth to ensure I can put those on my resume to not just be another white woman
