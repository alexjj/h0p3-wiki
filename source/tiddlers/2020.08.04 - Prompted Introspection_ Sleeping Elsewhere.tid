title: 2020.08.04 - Prompted Introspection: Sleeping Elsewhere

!! How do you feel when you sleep at someone's house?

Hrm, I see why [[2018.02.04 - Prompted Introspection Log: Sleeping Feeling]] and [[2019.12.27 - Prompted Introspection: Sleeping in a House]] aren't linked. I wish I were more consistent, lol. I don't think I could turn up the smartassitude up higher, sadly. I'm not even sure how much lead is left in this question's pencil either.

I feel differently depending on where I'm sleeping. I feel safer in some places than others (half-brained sleep blows). I feel more comfortable in some more than others too. Reasons for traveling to someone else's house aren't often great ones to me either, and I may find myself dealing with lots of unusual kinds of stress. There's a range, and that is to be predicted, I think. 

When I can sleep, I'll often be able to sleep-in at someone else's house pretty well. My schedule and what I aim to do has been thrown off enough that sleep is sometimes the best option. I also think I have more need for naps when I am surrounded by non-immediate family members. 

Falling asleep has become ritualized and streamlined somewhat for me. I need to have my background sound (and imaging). If I don't have that, however, then it's a totally different ballgame.
