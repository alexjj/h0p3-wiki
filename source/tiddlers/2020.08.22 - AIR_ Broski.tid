[6:32 PM] [[AIR]]: Haha:smile:
[6:32 PM] [[AIR]]: The titty one is the best lol
[6:32 PM] [[h0p3]]: Hell yeah.

[6:32 PM] h0p3: You aren't alright.
[6:32 PM] h0p3: I'm sorry. I wish I knew what to do. I am listening.
[6:34 PM] [[AIR]]: I wish I knew what to do too.
[6:34 PM] [[AIR]]: People I am so tired of people
[6:34 PM] h0p3: World is on fire, and not the good kind.
[6:35 PM] h0p3: I am lucky to have people like you in my life. 97% of the wankers drive me insane. You bring light to the world.
[6:36 PM] h0p3: Hard to have hope in the darkness.
[6:36 PM] [[AIR]]: I needed to hear that I'm like crying right now.
[6:36 PM] [[AIR]]: All I want to do right now is just drink and I'm not but I just want to forget everything right now
[6:37 PM] [[AIR]]: I think I am just mentally and emotionally exhausted
[6:38 PM] [[AIR]]: Smoking my weed
[6:38 PM] h0p3: I have no idea how to express how much I know that feeling. Thinking about the world is so god damn heavy. It's so existentially expensive to live right now.
[6:38 PM] h0p3: Fuck yeah.
[6:38 PM] h0p3: Hit it, broski.
[6:41 PM] [[AIR]]: I think it's time for me to get dog.
[6:41 PM] [[AIR]]: Cuz right now I really need a hug and love need that.
[6:41 PM] h0p3: It might be. A dog makes sense.
[6:42 PM] [[AIR]]: Talked to Gage about it and he wouldn't care.
[6:43 PM] h0p3: Dope.
[6:48 PM] [[AIR]]: So is working this morning at the country club. And I told one of the members he needs to wear a mask and he just talked back and that's why does even need to. In that moment another server had heard and piped up and said you're wearing the mask for my protection. But she just kind of laugh. which then I spoke up and said no you're wearing it for my protection because I just had a minor heart surgery and my body is still compromised that's why you're going to wear the mask.
[6:48 PM] [[AIR]]: He just scoffed at me he put it on but walked out all angry.
[6:48 PM] [[AIR]]: That was the tipping point for me today
[10:08 PM] h0p3: Fucking asshole.
[10:09 PM] h0p3: And, not the good kind.
[10:13 PM] [[AIR]]: It's sad, he's sad.
[10:14 PM] [[AIR]]: He didn't seem like a happy man.
[10:14 PM] [[AIR]]: Nor a good person .

[3:09 AM] h0p3: Trippy
[3:10 AM] [[AIR]]: I really liked this one too.
[3:10 AM] [[AIR]]: I thought it was kinda similar to my mushroom trip
[3:10 AM] h0p3: Yes.
[3:11 AM] h0p3: DMT didn't even come close for me (but I didn't smoke it).
[3:11 AM] [[AIR]]: I'd try that again
