Whereof one ought not speak, thereof one ought remain [[silent]]. There you go, homie. Fixed dat tautology for ya. At least sometimes it is true that if you can't say it right, you shouldn't say it at all. Words can be that costly, as your program has demonstrated, both literally and by implication. Silence the quietist.

Self-defeating codifications of anti-condificationism are often Cratylian. We are all outsiders to any perspective beyond our own (at best), and some perspectives are further from our own than others. Don't assume that just because the representations of grand narratives and foundations we have employed before have been flawed that we aren't justified in, if not obligated to engage in, pursuing fitting grand narrative(s) and foundation(s) into [[infinigress]]. Indeed, there are objective essences, and not all are normatively equal. Do not assume others assume as you do, but do assume there is a right way to assume in any given context, be it a perfect or imperfect duty. Defining what consists in a religion is itself a religious proposition. Epistemology is fundamentally a moral and hence religious project, one beyond ourselves and our own pleasure. Beware those who choose to deny a justified answer can be found when (1) their happiness depends on not finding it, and (2) they exhibit a history of pursuing their own happiness instead of truth.

There is no meaninglessness, even if you feel like there's no meaning (even nothingness has meaning, as we may find in the process theology of set theory, where the context of all contexts is oscillatorily recontainerized by nothingness into the [[infinigress]] of [[The Absolute]], strange loop of [[dialetheia]]). What you've found is a hard place in your heart or philosophy. Meaning isn't something that you construct (even if construction is necessary for discovery), and it doesn't revolve around you or your experience. It's outside you; you're attending to at least some independent meaning external to you. Further, meaning is easy to find. It all has meaning, some more positive than others. The prioritization of valence, value, category, boundary, or essence are the hard parts to pin down in a satisfactory and reasonable way, particularly when it requires us to sacrifice our happiness for something more important.

Sad to see people who pursue mere spiritual experience. That is too easily selfish, shallow, delusional, and bankrupt. [[Awe]] is not an intrinsic good.

The core of being a good person is spending everything you have on continuously becoming an objectively better person [[irwartfrr]] in your circumstances. It cannot be half-assed.
