title: 2020.12.05 - Wiki Review: Grafted*

* [[2020.12.04 - Prompted Introspection: Disappointing Muh Donors]]
** Edited. I hope not to spend too much time here. A shape is all I need now, I think. I'll have enough to defend myself, but there's a good chance we'll be no contact. I just have to handle the triangles (it is now very expensive to pit one's memory against mine) and a few other risks. 
* [[2020.12.04 - Wiki Review: Tiny Threads]]
** Edited. Wasn't going to leave [[m16]] at the old residence. She came same day, even if only to sleep with us. 
** //GoT// binge leaves me with only a couple seasons left, the worst ones. Barely worth the attention.

** Grafted. Eventually, the information ends up in here. [[monster]]-12 was a fine stand-in. `/salute`.
*** Could have done it on paper just fine too. Seems like a decent system.
*** I don't use Discord to take notes for, like, all the reasons, but I couldn't live without Signal for that (sadly, Tox is not multi-device and Antox is still a huge battery whore).
