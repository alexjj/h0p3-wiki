!! How has your health been this week?

* 1uxb0x
** Good.
* j3d1h
** Normal, slept a little better maybe.
*** Did it help when I bothered you to make sure you were going to bed at a reasonable time commensurate with your previous week of schoolwork?
**** Nah, I don't listen to you. I just chose to sleep earlier once or twice.
* k0sh3k
** Better! My back and neck are better, still not great; I've been sleeping through the night, though, which is excellent 
*** When do you know the "final" effectiveness/effects?
**** When my doctor says so. 
* h0p3
** Feet aint so good, but my stomach has been feeling the anxiety and pain. Hella. Sleep schedule continues to contort, into madness. Overall, though, pretty solid.

* 1uxb0x
** I liked my work in science.
** You did a really good job getting schoolwork done this week; thank you!
*** I liked your analysis of Othello and Chasing the Stars; I know you worked very hard figuring out their comparison. 
** I liked that the lightbulb comparison was one of the things you enjoyed and liked our conversation on different types of bulbs. Maybe green energy will be something you want to do more research on for your Friday electives? 
** You did a great job cooking this week. Good job, sir.
** You handled the passport process thoroughly. Memorizing your SSN (now we all have it memorized :P), receipts, calling in advance, setting up appiontments, dealing with forms and money, and researching. Your handwriting looks good to boot. It's real world shit, sir.
** Thank you for organizing the bathroom closet.
** Thanks for working out what I needed to do, passport-wise. That made it less stressful for me.
* j3d1h
** I'm glad that I try to keep my characters' stories straight.
** You put some effort into your schoolwork this week. It shows. Keep going, madame. Economics and lit are great places for you (and you care about them).
** Thank you for organizing the overflow closet.
** Your notes on the Voynich Manuscript were really good; so was your economics. 
** I like that you've been thinking more about how stories tie together - for instance, looking at the latest TPOH development and trying to think of where in the story they've already made references to eyes in order to find clues for what's going on, and trying to determine how long Arrested Development had been setting up Buster losing his hand to the seal. You're noticing the stories behind the story, which is cool. 
** I tend to like being around you, it just makes me feel happier and safer.
* k0sh3k
** I like to always be learning, and I like that I actively pursue opportunities to learn. 
** Thank you for taking us to the science center and having us think about the Voynich manuscript. Also, pretty cool that you've been having more "very good" days. You've been engineering them. =). 
** Your wiki do be telling a part of the story even I didn't get to hear in-person. Gracias, madame.
** Thank you for making sure that I'm dressed for the temperature. 
** Thanks for setting up* that Voynich manuscript webinar for us.
*** *I'm well aware you didn't organize it, but I mean.. like... finding/attending?
* h0p3
** I'm pretty cool with a cane. I need to practice my combat with it.
** Thank you for supporting me in endeavors even when you know it'll mean spending less time with you in order to get things done. 
** Thank you for buying us take-out food, even though it's more expensive than just making it at home.
** You're pretty decent at not changing plans last second (when you don't have to, at least).
* 5c0ut
** You've done a good job trying to control your sleep schedule. It shows too. You've been bright-eyed.
** Thank you for being willing to share your opinions on my culinary experiments! 
** You obviously care a lot for your craft.
** You seem to pick up people's personalities and intentions very quickly.
