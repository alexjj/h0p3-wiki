title: 2020.06.27 - Prompted Introspection: Hoping To See Each Other's Faces

!! Tell about something that you and your siblings do together now.

[[2019.05.21 - Prompted Introspection: Walk & Talk]] is especially striking to me today. I got off the phone with [[JRE]], and it's obvious that I'm working on just listening to him. He doesn't have an outlet, a method of being heard (not that I haven't asked many times for a wiki from him).<<ref "i">> It's not that he reads my words, but he has the chance if he wants (I realize it's not fun). It's an asymmetry in our relationship. I'm going to continue to press it in his favor. I don't want him to feel alone; it's so fucking easy to feel worthless in his shoes.

I'm also so grateful to have [[AIR]] back in my life. I treasure my chance to hear his voice. I regret that I do most of the talking with him. He just lets me prattle. I'm not pulling my weight correctly in our relationship. I need to find ways to remain silent. I've got this hypertext to say my piece (well, in a shattered billionty pieces).<<ref "s">> My ability to express myself is a privilege that few will ever have. I like being with my siblings (even when it's really painful, I'm honored to have the chance).

What do we do now? We talk. We weave our lives together where we can, [[WINTCIS]]. I live so far away from them. I'm beyond jelly that other folks get to see them offline and I don't. Lady Melisandre, I wish I could see their faces.

<<footnotes "i" "I do a really shit job of expressing it to the people in my life who spend the enormous energy it takes to write their thoughts out for [[others]] to ponder. You are a lot stronger and more generous than you give yourselves credit for. I'm sure that sounds self-serving. Honesty is so scary expensive. I hold your intentions in high regard.">>

<<footnotes "s" "I should continue to learn to remain silent in here as well where I ought. Not easy for a loud-mouthed asshole like me.">>
