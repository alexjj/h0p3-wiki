title: 2021.08.06 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Whose Jizz Is This?

Up way too fucking late talking with [[Anon]]s and [[TTTOTW]] about it. They were interesting encounters that required more attention after the fact though. Sleep by 5.

Sick sleep! Woke at 1:30? Dreams. A rare thing too, a totally different place that I don't think I've ever seen before. I wandered a lot (met some people too, nearly had sex even :P). Meditation. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

Motherfucking streamable rips off plebbit no work cleanly enough. I don't have a solution I adore. 

//Foundation// @ 5:40:00. Daughter is inconsolable that we stopped in the middle of a scene.<<ref "i">> (This is where your dad tells you he told you so about this being a cool story, and then he points to all the other cool stories that he's also probably going to have to force you to consume alongside him, and then one day, in the distant future, you'll think he's just as retarded as you always knew, but you'll be kinda sorta glad he was retarded).

//The Walk// with my offspring. Son had plenty for us to walk through in our conversation, my daughter is learning to dance. `/nod`. We walked through the first half of the second conversation of [[2021.08.06 - Anonymous: Yo]] (because apparently there's too much crossover today). They knew exactly what I thought before I said it. Lol. Saw the errors. [[???]] discussion. We shot the shit, jibberjabbered, talked of randomness. It was smooth AF.

Laundry. We worked on practical computer science today. She's found some fun problems with our solution for watch notification system, and he's staging to test the music metadata importer. We had fun (though I am sure at least she would vehemently deny it outloud: NEVER!!) Eventually, let them go. [[TTTOTW]].

PT was excellent for her! They are trying more things because they know she's insanely tense. Her back has never been right. She's doing everything she can to avoid having to rely upon taking medication for it, and that is admirable. Inform the Men! Mami. I feel so much better. Meditation. Shower of the gods!<<ref "a">>

We scrounged and chilled individually (Friday night party). She came down to talk and watch. "[[h0p3]] don't play, yo" has received all the giggles. Though, some facepalm squirm is real too, as we all know this part of me =D. (T H E W O R S T). Watched last two //Rick and Morty// shows because we will honor the first three seasons (and I've not seen Boobworld yet `/shakesfist`).

Lightning Struck! Thinkin'.

Leftover pierogies are dope. She offered to wake me up by pouring cold water...on her nipples, clearly. Laundry. [[TTTOTW]].
