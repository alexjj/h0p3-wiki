* A belief is knowledge if it is true, certain, and obtained by a reliable process
* Inductive arguments are justified insofar as the world is so constituted that they lead on the whole to true opinions.
* To say that a proposition is true means no more that to asset the proposition itself; "true" is used for purposes of emphasis or style.
