** I was better about sleeping this week.
** You did an amazing job replacing the toilet, sir.
*** You really did; thank you! 
** I have very much enjoyed [[D2]] with you. <3. I hope you'll dive deep with us. It can be another game like [[magic]] in this respect.
** i liked chatting about //don't forget// with you. :)
** You've both had great insights and questions during our Lent study; thank you for digging into it! 
** You made some great decisions at the store and argued effectively that you didn't need pajamas but did need other things. 
** You are a lot of fun to play games with. I look forward to playing with you more!
* j3d1h
** i adjust to new platforms very easily.
** It's good to see you planning for adulthood. I hope you'll continue to be practical in your pursuit of wisdom.

** You've both had great insights and questions during our Lent study; thank you for digging into it! 
** I have very much enjoyed talking to you about what you're learning - especially spiced up with your snarkiness! 
** I really want to learn about the games you play-even if it doesn't seem like I'd be interested in them, I get to know more about you!
** Thank you very super much for hanging out with us! I missed you!
* k0sh3k
** I'm going to be a student forever! Or at least the next six years. 
** Thank you for walking with me and the Toilet Date. Both rocked.
*** I have never had so much fun looking at toilets before. :) And I'm glad it's getting warm enough that walking isn't a terrible idea. :)

***<3
**Thank you for listening to me talk about the garden, even if it isn't something terribly interesting to you. I really appreciate the chance to enthuse, and it will help keep the motivation flowing.
** Speaking with you is the  of my life. Thank you for putting the effort in. Thank you for being amazing. The amount of effort it must have taken to grow into such a thoughtful and kind man (not to mention your integrity and intelligence) must have been staggering and I have nothing but love and respect for it.
* ASK
** You have [[change]]d my mind about casseroles. However rare they may be in the world, I like good ones. =).
*** In fact, you allow us to try many new things. Thank you.
** I'm happy to see you so excited about the [[garden]]. I like seeing you plan for years. It's gonna be dope and magical.
** That was the best corned beef of my life. Thank you for allowing us to eat like royalty this week.
** Thank you for throwing a party and turning a shitty time into a good one with us. Tasted like victory.
** I have no idea how to explain what it means to play [[D2]] with you. It is rare that I get to play, and I'm soaking it up. Thank you.
** You're doing well in a whirlwind of adjustments. I don't predict it will slow down for a while, and I admire your courage and ability to suck out the marrow of life at the same time. It is rare to find someone who can be optimistic despite seeing all that is evil about the world.
*** People like you exist. How could I not be optimistic?
** Thank you for taking over the gardening! You're much better with plants than I am, but I like talking to you about what you're planning. :) 
** i very much enjoyed chatting about my scrimblo with you!
** That corned beef was pretty freaking amazing.
** I'm pretty sure you'll have a large effect on my life-for the positive.
