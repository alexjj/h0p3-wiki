title: 2021.01.12 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Rumination

* Try To Take Over The WOrld
* Turned down Fireman Time!
* Chilled with [[k0sh3k]]
** She had enough sleep.
** Smells like cherries today. Overwhelms me, and I have to cough. Everytime. Loves to troll me. 
** She did her eyes, and I closed mine because I can't watch. More trolling.
** A discussion about that cold brew sitting for days woke my son up. He was listening to our conversation. It echoes through the house so loudly. 
* Sleep by 8:30
* Woke at 2:30
* Ruminated for hours. Lay in bed and live. Raced, conversations with constructions of my peeps (I love them too), keeping my stomach from turning inside and out.
* [[JRE]] Called
** Δ⁸ bad trip. He went an heroic, and it was ketamine-puking but with the pain. Still feeling it the next day. 
*** I would not have guessed that I would be able to take too much (not after that ounce puck for 3 days). This is a far more serious substance than might be initially guessed (it's not synthetic, but now I am left with worries, like perhaps a separate chemical profile would be worth seeing). It is good to know this one must be used cautiously (particularly for those of our background). It goes from gentle to hardcore pretty fast. 
** Unemployment is a go.
** 18th is the day of freedom
** Considering the protest. He is more moved by it than I am. I'm probably not all here mentally, so that might be part of it.
** Quinn is inconsolable, biomom missed appointment, no followup. 
** He is helping [[AIR]] with a fresh start. Looks like they will be set on their end. We catch.
*** Getting some furniture now. I've got a heater, but it still might be too cold (it's not the basement). If need be, he shares my room with me. Not like he's never seen my tiny penis before.
* Ruminated
** Feel like giving up. Just reply mode with the requisite canvassing meets the basic requirements of the {[[Axiom]]}. That's still [[hope]], right? It's not the spirit of it of though. 
*** Give it time, loser. You'll uncurl.
* Brief chat with my son, then my wife pulled me upstairs for the meeting.
* Meeting With Insurance Agent
** I wish he'd just hand me his key. We had to help him interpret and fill out the forms, and he's been doing this a long time. 
** Some questions had to be answered gracefully. XD. 
*** I think my daughter will be able to do this, but my son, I don't know (maybe...it is hard to see; he's got my retardations, ofc [sorry kid]).
* Coffee
* //The Walk//
** ADHD, diagnosis considerations
** Already at 75% bandwidth usage for the month. Assholes. Fine. Yet again, you have me over a barrel Xfinity/Comcast. 
** Matty is doing Hebrew again with my wife (SZ might talk shop too, pass notes in it, eh?). It's been a really long time since I've seen him. 
*** If you ever see this, sir: you are an excellent philosopher (hvrdsxlsr). You were the best TA I've ever had excluding my wife (I earned my grades with her). I'm [[grateful]] to have met you. You helped me think about the world differently.
** Turns out I was right! I always am. It's 2 weeks early. So irregular, and I called it. Explains why the sex was that good.<<ref "a">> But more importantly: (1) her argument was wrong and (2) she was wrong because she's a woman.
*** MESS WITH THE BEST, DIE LIKE THE REST
*** For Christmas, I want a signed copy of [[this book|https://www.amazon.com/Way-Superior-Man-Challenges-Anniversary/dp/1622038320]], please. I'm going to read it to you each morning with extra cream in your coffee. 
*** I was comforting, of course, //after// I gloatingly gathered my delicious "I hate you's."<<ref "s">>
* Rumination
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Most didn't eat. Just chilled at the table. Slung some cards too.
** [[MTG]]
*** Turns/Draws (after keeps)
**** Infect is this gorgeous example of the flaw in handicapped tempo. A strict timewalk allows some glass cannons to simply thrive unchecked. Glistener, then oops in your base T2 without interaction sucks. CA is the next the best option. Perhaps we should ratchet small first.
*** Daughter's Affinity vs Infect +1/+1, 0/+1, 0: Rancor Mamba rides to victory on -3 toughness a turn; she fails to take the risk of clampcycling hard enough, unblockable with blessing nearly alphastrikes, then swing with everything to end; she's been juggling with ravager much more wisely, and the turn before I have her (I'm tapped out), she drops a second topdecked plating, activates 2 nexii, and ravager alphastrikes for 26. 
**** I like how she doesn't scoop. When she's being rational with me, she's got a cute "fuck you" about her I adore.
* Failed tag with [[AIR]]. Sorry.
* Try To Take Over The World
* Fireman Time!
** I am surprised I could. I've been unable to get hard all day. Rumination sucks.
