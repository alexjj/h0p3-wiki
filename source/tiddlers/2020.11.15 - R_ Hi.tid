title: 2020.11.15 - R: Hi

Hi, [[Mom|BAGD]].<<ref "s">>

I am safe, and I think I'm doing well enough. [[Thank you|Gratitude]] for being a quiet pillar in my life. I see the traces of you in [[my wife]] [[every day|Carpe Tempus Segmentum]]. Some of the last [[words|Alias]] I said to you in person I still [[naked]]ly [[believe]].<<ref "a">> 

In [[my last|2018.06.23 - Letters with R]] major [[letter|Letters]] to [[you|R]], I agreed to the two greatest commandments. I have raced like few humans have to show it. [[The Good]] and [[The Right]] continue to be [[developed|Abstract Objects]], slowly. I have written every day for the past four years.<<ref "w">> I'm not sure how to compress it. I've never worked so hard on anything in my entire life. 

A great deal has transpired since we last spoke. I feel like my immediate, close-proximity has continued to improve (and more than I could have hoped for), but I watch the world crumbling in despair. Like a [[madman|2019.06.25 - DeathOfRobinhood: The Chickenscratch Confession Booktour]], I continue to race in the desert to find a practical answer. I have been beyond [[fortunate|Moral Luck]] to have met [[kind strangers|Root Users]] in the wild. I [[aim]] to build myself and [[community|Justice]] as best I can with what I have.<<ref "i">> 

I think about you often, especially on my walks. I know I do not [[connect|Contact]] much, but I quietly listen and think.<<ref "c">> I [[hope]] to be useful to you. If and when the time arises, please consider living with us. Even if you don't need it, you have a place in the world with [[us|Family Log]].

[[Love]],

[[h0p3]]
