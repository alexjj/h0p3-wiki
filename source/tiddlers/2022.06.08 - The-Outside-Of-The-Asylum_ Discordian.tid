//Took me a while to think about what you said. I had a lot more I had considered saying, but I think I should wait and slow down.//

> I've heard the name but I have not read anything by him yet. I had a book by him I bought for one of my customers and it seemed interesting. 

My endorsement here is not a prediction that you will outright [[like]] him or his approach, but it's a worthy [[wrestle]] nonetheless. If at all, you may find it a more valuable use of your time to consider crystallized summaries of his body of work instead.<<ref "th">> 

> So my logic for defining a empty pleasure is thought. Whether or not the media provokes what Gregory Hill and Kerry Thornley would consider to be greater truths. Truths which are true, false, and meaningless all at the same time. A complicated web of relationships. DFW's infinite jest comes to mind. It's both leisure and thought provoking. It is both true and false, and definitely has times of meaningless. 

Please feel free to skip the topic (or any*...I'm too talkative a person in many cases, [[nomad]]). I'm interested in further understanding your claims here. 

It's fair to say you are Discordian, in the Eris-related sense, I believe. Would you call yourself ascetic? How about [[stoic]]? I realize it's difficult to label.

I can't say much to Discordian positions, but I do have a recommendation for you that is perhaps out of left field but may lend some analytic-style creedence to at least parts of the claim that "All statements are true in some sense, false in some sense, meaningless in some sense, true and false in some sense, true and meaningless in some sense, false and meaningless in some sense, and true and false and meaningless in some sense." Sir Graham Priest's //One: Being an Investigation into the Unity of Reality and of its Parts, including the Singular Object which is Nothingness// provides some clean work on some very hard problems (he has several books). [[The Dialetheia]] is quite an object to be concerned with, this thing that is both true and false at the same time. I [[aim]] to be humble about such a thing. It is quite difficult to reconstruct a fair representation, to my eyes. I'm hard-pressed to pick out meaninglessness; I am not even convinced that it would have the meaning we might attribute to it (let alone what it objectively possesses). It may even be a harder problem than the being of nothing. 

[[Infinite Jest]] was probably above my paygrade. I take DFW to be decrying postmodernism while possibly having produced a postmodern work (the result of taking modernism to the Nth degree). I relate to the spaghetti though, and appreciate the chaos. At a surface level, I think my ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî± has some in common with this book that required at least two bookmarks.

> I have 2 years of playtime logged into Runescape. Realizing that was a crisis moment for myself.

Ah. Yes, sir. I've been there. Lawd. XD. I have quite mixed feelings about my time in [[game]]s like Runescape (there aren't many that are so immersive and addictive). +700 days played is, in some sense, impressive. Were you pretty [[leet|Leet]]? I can only assume that you are quite dedicated to your projects when you decide that's what you want to do. I think Everquest and Runescape players have been among the most hardcore players I've known for decades now. Seems like you've done well with your crisis. What could be more zen than serving tea to [[others]]?

<br>

> Sometimes I'll help out if she needs me. There's usually a piece of furniture I have to move. And I'm not sure, I'll have to show it to her the next time I see her.

It's pretty cool that you get to help her out. If you have the [[chance]], let me know how she thinks about it. 

<br>

> Other than basic safety and first aid I don't think it taught me anything about the modern world. However I don't really live a modern life. So a lot of boyscout things come in handy these days. more and more every day actually. And no, most of them got out of my small town

It seems quite difficult to wrap my head around the modern world (to whatever [[dok]] I do), and it seems to be getting harder as everything moves faster. Sometimes I feel old like Brooks Hatlen, the Shawshank Prison librarian. 

If at all, how do you think the boyscouts shaped your persistent disposition or character? How about your perceptual lenses?

It sounds like you intend to be a permanent pillar of your small town community. Do you feel any sense of obligation toward it or comfort about it? I could imagine one might have mixed feelings about a small town.

<br>

> I don't disagree with the idea of an online "community". I disagree with the value people put into it. Again, avid gamer, I had way more online friends than real friends growing up, and I believe personally it stunted my social growth. Shit, I had online girlfriends and turned down real dates because I was "taken". I think there is some value to be had shouting into the void and listening to what the void shouts back. But being parasocial is a fine line.

I can't say that any of the gaming communities I've participated in were even close to ideal online communities.<<ref "to">> They barely even went beyond the surface in my experience (generally a lot of broken people gathered together). I've always been somewhat of a loner online.<<ref "l">> I often prefer to play markets, write bots, buy raids, solo the edges of the game, PvP, and spend more time metagaming than directly playing. I can appreciate how it stunts social growth (surprisingly, I think it actually helps some people to some extent). 

I'm going to push back on your phrasing some: online friends can be real friends. Offline "friends" can also end up being fake friends too (I daresay some offline relationships may be parasocial, and I even wonder if how we model others minds isn't also parasocial in some respects). Skepticism is in order, no doubt. I agree there are serious limits to the relationships we can build on the wire (I work to push that boundary pretty hard too). I'd also agree that the difference between what we experience online with someone can be so much different from what we'd experience offline with them (and it can be further complicated when it is both). Being online is like slurping through a low-bandwidth straw (and part of why I think [[PSM]]ing requires building larger bodies of work). For some of the most important bi-directional relationships of my life, I've only seen a picture of their face and heard just hours of their voice. 

I can appreciate your regret. I can imagine these issues will be something we'll both be thinking about for a long time.

Do you think there are online interactions that don't boil down to shouting in the void? As an autistic man who is quite a 4eak, I find more offline encounters to be horrifically shallow and usually dishonest. What do you think it means to be parasocial? I have a hard time drawing those lines myself. To escape parasociality, do you think it takes some [[faith]] in [[other]]s at some level? This is poorly asked, but can an experience with someone be sufficiently real and significant even if they didn't intend it to be or are even consciously aware of it as such?

<br>

> Edit: Just now realizing you said meatspace and not metaspace. I Have a community of loyal customers. I'm very upfront and honest about how much profit I make from them, and my profit margins are low so that usually breaks the first barrier ($3 for a brewing session $1 for a single cup and I make $5 on bags of tea, they all have different costs). The rest is done on the library side, most of my customers are college kids and they enjoy chatting up about various books, getting/giving recommendations, all that jazz. I always try to stress people to explore the local community, business and non-profit. I think there's something to be said about spending money locally, in a ideal world we would be trading solely in goods or services but that's an anarcho-pipe-dream.

I suppose my question was about more than your customers here, although I do think we can build good relationships from that practice. But, you stress that as well. Do you explore your local community often? When I was a boy, I lived in a very small town where everyone knew everyone. Is it a bit like that for you? Do you think people are focusing less and less upon their local communities (and not just with their money)?

I agree there are good reasons to want to be able to spend one's money locally. I'm not convinced that competitive advantages are unleashed without scaling up, specializing, and being at least somewhat interdependent with the rest of the world. I think there are good reasons for money to exist; they are essentially forms of highly liquid debt, sometimes enscribed on something that also has additional instrumental value in its composition. Like many people, I'm losing trust in what it stands for, and it may cease to be money in some cases. Been thinkin' about [[Unorthodox Savings]]. What do you think?

<br>

> Well, you have plenty of options. There are car-outlet kettles, jetboil is always another option. (I use jetboil everything for my personal cooking needs) I personally sell this travel tea set, or you could get a french press if they're a coffee person. Either way you'd want a accurate cooking thermometer so you can get the right temperature of water.

I will see him soon. I'll try and ask him about it, see if we can make it better for him. Thank you.

<br>

> Yeah I love planning it out, and no it's on top of a hill. I bought it to make Swales and plant a load of stuff, tea being one of them. But, priorities, home first. And the land isn't super impressive, It only had a small clearing for a trailer, and it's not super big. but I don't mind. It's a plot to my name and a spot for my grave.

Gonna be pretty [[awe]]some to literally make your own tea. We've been growing yaupon. It's not amazingly delicious, but it has a decent amount of caffeine in it. Might be worth having a bush on your land, idk. I know coffee is gettin' pretty expensive, and the projections for it given global warming are unsavory. An unideal replacement for the hardcore coffee drinkers, I suppose, but I could imagine others being practical and switching over to tea for their caffeine drank.

> The past is history, the future a mystery, and the present is a gift. but i wouldn't even consider myself a boss, this is a hustle and that's it. something that I can enjoy and put food on my plate with.

`/nod`. Cool. Sounds like you are keeping your ear to the ground and an open mind. Who knows then? That sounds like you are on quite a journey.

<br>

> It was during a bad LSD trip. I just realized coming off of it that I was doing too much crazy shit, and was a super bad person, and I needed a change. 

I can only see tiny slivers of you. I think you've been attentive, sincere, and kind. I think you've been constructive with your self-hatred, and I worry too harsh. It's my honor to know you. 

> I think DFW says it best though. People tell you that life gets better sober, and sure physically it does, but even now working on two years sober I'm arguably worse off. Drugs are a bad coping mechanism. but they do help you cope. And I think everyone's coping pretty hard these days. I've talked to a lot of people that feel like all of their waking hours outside of labour are spent coping with their reality. Through drugs or vicariously through TV/Youtube/Videogames etc. They just want their mind numb after a long day of work. and I feel that. It's very much a struggle for me to not do it myself. And I am no saint, I trip up all the time. But I actively try to enjoy the moment, and not just cope myself into enjoying it.

Yup. The pursuit of aesthetic at the expense of what really matters. I can imagine it's hard to have [[hope]] for many people. Sounds like you are biting the bullets, keeping your eyes open, and doing the hard work. I'm glad you are finding joy where you do. Rock on, sir. 

<br>

> Hope you're having a good day! It was too hot and gas was too pricey for me to even bother going out today. trying to patiently wait for this shipment of tea, I need to be more prepared next summer.

What's gas prices like for ya per month? I fear it will only get worse here. Are there other hustles you've had on the brain?

> -Patient

Is Patient the name you would prefer to be called by?
