Esteban just works 2-10 instead of his 10-3 and Matthew is Receiving unemployment
May 1 11:20am

May 1 11:21am
I also won disability so we are moving to a better townhouse until I found a house to buy
May 1 11:21am
Awesome. I'm glad that you all are getting out of there.
May 1 11:22am
How are the doggos and kitty cat?
May 1 11:23am
Good struggling with max he seem to have a bad rash on his tummy we’ve taken him to the vet and they want him on meds or a steroid I’m not liking these options 
So we have change their food to support skin and coat to see if it’ll help as well as a coconut oil ointment for eczema dry skin and rash on dogs it seems to really be helping let’s see if the food takes it to completely healed
May 1 11:30am
Hopefully that works. Finding the right food seems to get harder. [[k0sh3k]] often has to hunt and rotate.
May 1 11:32am
Yea
May 1 12:07pm
How are you all doing I’m sorry for delay response dealing with a 2 year old
May 1 1:11pm
Lol, no worries. I know you are super busy at work. I'm glad you'd spend even spare moments chatting with me. 2yos are no joke. I have no energy or spoons left when taking care of them.
May 1 1:12pm
We're doing fine. Offspring are getting bigger. [[1uxb0x]]'s hands are about as big as mine.
May 1 1:13pm
Mostly grinding in school.
May 1 1:13pm
It definitely has its challenges
May 1 1:13pm
Oh man I’m sire he growing into a you g man
May 1 1:14pm
How is [[k0sh3k]] doing
May 1 1:14pm
She's able to work from home, and that has been a really good thing for us.
May 1 1:14pm
Is CT cool? Have you guys gotten to get out and just drive around
May 1 1:14pm
That’s good
May 1 1:14pm
She's still finding her place in a giant system.
May 1 1:14pm
We tried a few restaurants, but mostly drive to get to stores. Most of the time we go outside, we walk. There's a pretty amazing walking path right next to us (no idea how it exists, I've never seen one like it in a city).
May 1 1:16pm
CT is cool.
May 1 1:16pm
I only make friends with the homeless, but I interrogate the capitalists.
May 1 1:17pm
Somehow, the neighborhood is even more insulated.
May 1 1:17pm
Oh shit lol
