title: 2021.10.19 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Normal Grind

Woke at 6:20. My natural timer is cutting it too close. Solid sleep, crazy dreams. She's nearly out of the door. 3 things lost or forgotten. Clean stuff, real textbook. We definitely are adults in control of lives. She's wearing that grey sweater flapper tassel dress on the bottom (undershirt makes me sad because I want booba out), almost wore tights for warmth. Could not keep my hands off her, but my dragonbreath is pwning this morning. She graciously handed me XO after XO. Fill the holes. All of them.

My daughter is awake. Her mother woke her to make sure school would be worked upon. Don't want nothing to eat or drink, aight. I wish you luck, madame.

[[ASK]]ing. [[TTTOTW]] + LoLWorlds Highlights. Fireman Time! (I did not want to wait). Half-shower. Hotdogs. [[TTTOTW]]. Chat with [[Anon]]s. Chips + Water + Vapelyfe.

My son is feeling stressed trying to communicate what he needs for his project. Again a discussion about data types. My daughter walked us through functions in [[Rust]] and why we would care about being explicit and automated inference of parameters and arguments. [[JRE]] called [[j3d1h]], so she gracefully exited.

//The Walk// with my offspring was smooth enough. We fidgeted and argued. They argued mostly, about literature. Not my bailiwick. I don't know shit about it. But, I do understand my son's frustrations. We really suck at it. Lol. It's okay. My son is still struggling to communicate what he's doing on his machines. I think narrowing the vocabulary to a specialty will be valuable for him (and, it doesn't help that I'm not skilled either). 

She came down to give me hugs. [[TTTOTW]] + LolWorld Highlights. PSG styled on FNC with that finish. Good gawd. Brutal BM. It's technically against the rules. I adore it. Phreak wouldn't even "cover it," lol.

After she had acquired enough interweb points, I was able to drag her downstairs. //Raw Skintime// -> //Inform the Men!// Life is good. Shower of the gods! A is a lame duck who is "done with this [Y-Entity] shit" even though he's in charge of several layers for the next couple years. Alcoholism doesn't help. He doesn't even have to do heavy lifting here; just get out of the way. Trying converge the incommensurable is exhausting, I realize. 

Meow got into the tuna salad my son prepared. =/. Dinner was late, but it was good. Sandwiches with sprouts, and I had 3 fingers of whiskey. The "Perfect Woman" model episode of //House//. 

//Midnight Mass// + //Skintime//. Her tummy isn't feeling good. Did what we could. She's singing along with the hymns in the show. I hate scary film, but I will endure it. 

[[ASK]]ing and [[TTTOTW]] before I just couldn't stay awake any longer. Hit the hay at 10.
