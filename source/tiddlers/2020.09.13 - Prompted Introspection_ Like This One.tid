!! You are a children's book writer. Write the first few lines of your new book.

`/gulp`. Yes, [[Saint Diogenesocrates]]. I will do my [[Straussian]] best.<<ref "1">>

//Wake up, fellow child. If we know what's good for us, we know right now we're here together. So, help me carefully gather everyone around yonder fires. Let us peer into lights and shadows to bear witness of [[our stories|Find The Others]] in [[The Great Human Conversation]].//

You want to know my story? Lawd. C'mon now: ur kiddin. 

( ՞ਊ ՞)

I wish I knew a good one for yall. 

Don't you wanna listen to hers (/¯–‿･)/¯, or his \( ﾟヮﾟ)/, or theirs └[∵┌]└[ ∵ ]┘[┐∵]┘, ԅ[ •́ ﹏ •̀ ]? 

How about yours? 

... It's my turn? ¯\(°_o)/¯

You really want to hear my story again? 

⊙﹏⊙, hrm, okay. 

Surely, you must be tired of this `/pick-up-the-book` heap of squiggles and words?<<ref "抛砖引玉">> (I've been writing and Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄ƷwingingƸӜƷ it for quite a while).<<ref "b">> 

Yeah, I too reckon this here is the book we are reading right now.<<ref "o">> Can you see, or hear, or feel hearts beating in and out of the pages? I can. //*thu-thump, thu-thump*//

¸.•♥•.¸¸.•♥•.¸¸.•♥•.¸¸.•♥•.¸

Aye, aight, fair enough, ifeelya, and so it begins in some sense...

> ...well, hold on, but first, ☝(°ロ°), I have to ask ya real quick: how do you know [[when stories are real enough|Deconstruction Obligates Reconstruction]]? Itellyawhat, I don't [[know myself|Know Thyself]] nor [[the answer(s)|Philosophy]] myself well enough. I hate to say there's a contradiction anywhere in my story, but [[I must|The Dialetheia]]. So, look out for me as I try to read and write this book because I'm definitely going to need your [[help]]. I got my marking tools right here `/pick-up-marking-tools`, so feel free to fix it with me on the fly or when you get the chance, `/hand-over-marking-tools`. Please, you gotta help me tell it better.<<ref "i">> It can't be just mine: I have to [[share]] it with you.

> They say there is no story without two or more sides to hear and tell it. Beware! (㇏(•̀ᵥᵥ•́)ノ). [[Including this sentence|ITS]], very few people have told a story [[like this one|2020.09.13 - Prompted Introspection: Like This One]] to and for the ones they [[love]] and hate. This book is sometimes awful. I know you'll agree, and you should. I never know enough about the truth of reality to tell anyone (not even myself) about it really and truly well. ~~It's just, like, the worst.~~ I most certaintly am not the person you'll want to listen to the most, kid, (－‸ლ). I'm not you (duh ;P), and //*pst*// I'm a crazy person (´༎ຶ ͜ʖ ༎ຶ). I can't think straight and I'm lost so often. I don't know who we are and what we are doing here, [¬º-°]¬, but I [[hope]] to know and do it well. Don't you? 

> We are hurled into our worlds, bouncing around sometimes in deep vertigo.<<ref "v">> Living our lives can be a lot like [[naked]]ly reading and writing in a [[whirlwind|Whirlwind]]y world of many words (spoken and unspoken), like wrestling, like taking off our chains, like tunneling from the inside to the outside of the cave,<<ref "r">> like hunting or gathering or farming, like drowning or sailing, like wandering the desert, like waking up from dream after {[[dream]]}, like channeling or shooting for the stars of paradise here and everywhere as best we can with what we have, and like just //being there// watching the sun rise and set together in [[awe]].<<ref "s">>

> Like in any good book ([[(－‸ლ), which is not to say this is a good book|WINTCIS]]), you should go on some adventures and break some rules, sometimes for fun, and sometimes despite that it's not fun. We must make mistakes because we are [[flawed, finite, and fallible|fff]]. I don't know how to read and write anything well enough either, but we have to tell stories together: that's essential to the kinds of creatures that we are. Mind you: it's risky! Pain is a teacher, and sometimes it's the only teacher we'll listen to. 

> Yeah, we are young. Time feels so slow for you right now, but it will speed up: everything will move too fast for you some day to spend it wisely enough. What does it mean to be a [[Good]] version of yourself? How, when, where, and why and for whom or what are you going to choose who we are going to be, who we think we are now, and who we thought we were? Why suffer?

> ~~Unfortunately, though they will not say it out loud directly, you need to know that most people don't care about you, so [[love]] wisely and love your [[computer|Monster]] too (that's just [[Common Sense]]). Learn what matters with everything you have. Thus, you need to know how to find the clitoris and the prostate (use your dicktionary and your journal every day!). Furthermore, serve the poor the flesh of the wealthy...~~ 

> One of the morals of this story is simply this: express and experience the symbols of the world openly and humbly. Read and write (and don't read and don't write) the words of our lives carefully. What is [[good]] is [[good]] beyond even your [[imagination|ridtyawtr]] (and everyone else's too), and what is wise is to be kind to everyone as well as you can know how. Same for me.

> Well shoot, here I am rambling again, dude. Let's get to the story...

> <<footnotes "v" "Vertigo is experiencing some kinda dis-orientayshun. Maybe sometimes it is the feeling that you're moving when you're not. Or it might feel like things around you are moving when they aint. Even mild vertigo can feel similar to motion sickness. People experiencing vertigo generally describe the sensation as “feeling dizzy” or feeling as if the room is spinning. At the very least, vertigo is a feeling of uncertainty, and perhaps it's like the lack of a comfortable stance on solid ground.">>
