The bourgeois have the luxury of worrying about their long-term futures.

When someone declares that something is none of anyone's business, you should doubt their intentions.

If you're unwilling to eat bugs for a non-physiological medical reason: you're a bad person. It's in the same ballpark of bourgeois virtue signaling of those who refuse to spend time with a racist/sexist/homophobic/transphobic person but won't keep the same standard for wealthy people, egoists, or anti-realists (sometimes much more damaging positions to hold, no doubt). Of course, we should also be incredibly weary of those who aim to feed others bugs while they eat classier foods.

I don't think there's anything incoherent about being a person who simultaneously participates in culture that is both direct ("ask", low context, explicit, explained, assertive) and indirect ("guess", high context, implicit, implied, passive), even if not the same respect at the same time, and so forth. Sometimes we kinda need both.
