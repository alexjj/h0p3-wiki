title: 2021.10.20 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Den Develops

Woke at 6. It was enough, though a nightmare with me flying (that was the cool part). She's up. Pushed bricks. I think she's feeling more negative this morning. Mini-massage. Many XOXOs. She's dressing for cold weather now in earnest now (`/wahhh`, hides everything<<ref "t">>). Maybe the fruit flies we've been swatting for days will die out here soon enough. I began making the roast. Hands and breakfast. SZ has said she's gotta do another presentation for ATLA (I think after L3, she should just sit on it). Access user services is always the frontline, and there are several kinds of first aid that are worthy. I don't consider it mission creep (I'd be fine with every person being required to learn it); so, arguing why and how to do it easily makes sense. So many plates are spinning. Her life is an [[RGM]]. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Woke offspring. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! Once a day is very limited. Very. I'm doing good. Heal up buddy. Half-shower. [[TTTOTW]] + Salad + LolWorlds.

Finished setting up everything for the roast. It's got a coffee rub? Well, it's alright. Hard Dadnap. Offspring worked on their machines downstairs with me, eating their candy and grinding.

[[5c0ut]]'s BF, Dev, is coming for dinner tomorrow. He's gonna watch some //House// or something with us. Dope. If you're family, I'm not cleaning my room for you (trust, bitches, let it all hang out when we hang out). Not family yet. We cleaned [[The Den]] well enough. Still looks like a basement dweller's basement, but fancier. There are fewer cat+human+dust monsters crawling the floor, everything is put away decently, and even my the fabric of my desk is prettier. 

Shopping @ Home Depot with my offspring. My son talked about what he covered in permaculture, and I can tell his writing is helping him speak about it. I'll nitpick, and he'll openly join me. =). My daughter didn't accomplish much, and she's feeling the weight of doing emotional labor for her friends who don't seem to have it together either (none of us, I suppose). She talked with me about different kinds of comments in [[Rust]]. We picked up a dark red paint for the table, found $11 reinforced cardboard (though, I'm not convinced yet) for the bottom to build out a hidden desk for [[MTG]] cards, chalk, dice, etc. He's been re-working the scripts for publishing, so it's getting closer. Cool.

[[ASK]]ing, and we're thinking about how to get a 26-foot trailer anywhere near the house. Spoke with Scott for an hour: our first real conversation. He's asking his wife is they'd be willing to take our parking spots to allow us to use the "[[shared]]" driveway (I have no idea why they'd say no). He helped me measure and chalk out some options. He works in investment/retirement_benefits. We had plenty to talk about, he followed my questions but the one's I'm worried about he couldn't begin to answer, and he clearly stays in his lane. His job is to avoid lawsuits, not to understand. He seems to have little compassion or interest in the plight of the global poor (with contradictions to boot). 

//The Walk// with mi amor. G just took his office, and nobody challenged him. We may make the same play with tweaks (garnering sympathy first, as A's lameness is bleeding into what seems to be irrational territory to me [I must be missing something]). We need real estate to bargain with 2-3 years from now. I think the honeymoon here is over, and perhaps we'll follow G's footsteps post-promotion as well (seems like a wise use of our resources). SZ likes the ATLA proposal (sweet). Difficult discussion about my polyhood, and still thinking about it. 

[[Family Gathering]] was excellent. We had a roast with veggies, and I had two bowls with water and dark chocolate. We watched gonorrhea donor heart episode of //House//. //Skintime//. 

A second coat of red paint on the table. Offspring are in charge of this. Dishwashing machine might be having some clogging. We need to figure that out (as they are taking it apart to clean the trap/filter, using vinegar helps some, but it's still suffering). [[TTTOTW]]. Also, my penis is not doing great. `/sigh`. I have to try to hold off more.

VC with [[ASK]] while working on [[The Bootable USB Thumbdrive]]. Listening and walking down memory lane. All of us, I think.
