; 1770-1831: Hegel

* "Geist" (spirit-mind) is the stuff of existence, the ultimate essence of being.
* Everything is the result of an intelligible (not arbitrary) process of change, and everything is changing.
* Reality is a historical process where Geist develops towards self-awareness.
* Dialectical Process: Thesis (first stage) + Antithesis (reactions, conflicts) = Synthesis (a new thesis)
* Change is dominated by historical forces; the individuals have no control, they are caught up in the spirit of their time ("Zeitgeist").
* When Geist will reach self-awareness, everything will be harmonious and change will stop ("the Absolute").
* In the Absolute, we will be free from conflict, happily serving the whole instead of our own interests.
* Our institutions, rules, and ideas become external constraints on us, alienating us from ourselves.
* We project qualities onto God (omniscience, etc.) that alienate us from Him whereas we share the same spiritual existence.
* One's self-consciousness is dependent on one's recognition of those others as similarly recognizing oneself as a self-conscious object.
