Forged from inner chaos, transmute myself into a meme warlock, spin comms with correct rotational speed in order to interact with someone at the same frequency, exchange phonemes and printed symbols across the void, but not merely because I want someone to see me for who I am. Who would only ever want that? It's not about merely me. Never was.

It makes me feel warm and fuzzy, like I responsibly made a difference and showed my support, when I tritely direct people to suicide hotline numbers. Enjoy your possible involuntary incarceration, losing your job, residence, kids, etc. Suicidal ideation is practically a crime, not only because you are a liability, but especially because it puts a spotlight on the fact that we aren't actually going to do anything to solve the underlying problems you're experiencing either.  This is the cheapest way to silence you and maintain the status quo, and we all quietly know that nobody actually gives a fuck about you, so stop signaling that to us with your ideation, okay? We don't want to be reminded. Get out of our sight and out of our minds. We're here to have a good time in our own stories, and you're messing that up.
