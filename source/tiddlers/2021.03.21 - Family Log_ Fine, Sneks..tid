title: 2021.03.21 - Family Log: Fine, Sneks.

!! Write a paragraph summarizing each person's week:

* [[1uxb0x]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I had a lot of fun in games. I found two games, one which I had played with my sister years ago. And also one that is a sort of beta of another. Funny enough, most games I like have strong and/or important communities. For instance, both of the games I've found were opensource and were developed heavily by the community. I've liked playing with MTG, but my decks haven't been that good as compared to others. My work wasn't great, but what I did I liked, especially my joke.
** j3d1h
*** Your Language Arts is really well done! I suggest paying as much attention to that as you can, because knowing and using tropes is super helpful in analysis (as well as writing for yourself). Talking to you about Kumach was very fun as always, and I hope to develop that part of the world more soon! You should really chat with more people, you're in enough servers to do so.
** k0sh3k
*** @1uxb0x:  I'm glad you found a couple different games you enjoy this week. I really enjoyed talking to you about your literature work this week, and I hope you enjoy The Graveyard Book; I did! You did well in science this week, too - next week, remember, you're watching Curiosity Stream videos and making notes on what you watch. Thank you for writing the paragraph on your week, too. I've enjoyed trading bad jokes with you!
** h0p3
*** [[1uxb0x]] has played a lot of games on his machines and at the table with his family. I continue to beg him to take up reading (in both his mother's style and mine) or math/CS (preferably all of the above). His schoolwork wasn't up to snuff, but it's good that he wrote. He's been spending more time with family this week. 
** AIR
*** he got to play a lot of games, also finding two games he used to play. He also played a lot of MTG (he is getting really good, not just playing the game but also creating his deck, he has picked this up crazy fast.) he has been struggling on focusing on doing the do for homework.  he didn't write much in his wiki for each day  get more detailed, I want to know what made those days good or bad.) I like your Language Arts.

* [[j3d1h]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I have an opposite effect with music than you, where I'll get distracted (as the majority good music for me stirs my imagination.) You've called me over to talk a lot, which I've been happy about. Also, I need to ask if you've set your i3 font as comic sans.
** j3d1h
*** This week was alright, but a little hazy and unfocused. I built up a few characters with Smokey/Pip/1uxb0x (but none with all 3, unfortunately), as well as introducing a few to Butter. I didn't get to talk with as many others as I'd like, but that's alright. I'm thinking of hosting some sort of event on the art server, since it's a little inactive, but inactivity is common with these servers. MTG was good, mostly because I built a nice deck with some good bombs. I should just pick up all the crazy good things from now on, no matter the colour.
** k0sh3k
*** @j3d1h: I'm glad you were able to work on world-building this week; it sounds like the world is coming along nicely! I've enjoyed trading memes and talking about books with you this week; you'll have to let me know if When You Trap a Tiger is worth reading or not. 
** h0p3
*** [[j3d1h]] helped automate some music on [[m16]] (mixing something for me), she made some amazing ribs this week, and she be extra-violent. Her schoolwork was underwhelming, and she obviously had plenty of time to fart around and have fun. She's been enjoying playing [[MTG]], and we've all had fun with her.
** AIR
*** @j3d1h: She had a hazy week, she was able to play with her friends, I liked her Science, she likes walking around listening to music, she gets lost in it, she and 1uxb0x made ribs and potato wedges and a veg platter this week, (the ribs were very good and the wedges were great!)

* [[k0sh3k]]
** 1uxb0x
*** Kevin yata yata yata, what I want to know, is where is the heel-face turn? (I know there won't be.) You've read a LOT this week. I'm surprised you needed to triple your vitamin d. I'm happy your getting to have your vaccination.
** j3d1h
*** I'm sorry about the cold weather migraines, but at least you know what to expect in winter now. I'm glad you got everyone into lent madness, it's a really cool event! That presentation on neoliberalism sounds fantastic, and so do a bunch of these presentations. I think I'll have (or already have) the exact same problem with humanities/STEM/gym. I really like that vague book idea, and I'd love to write it sometime!
** k0sh3k
*** @Myself: I attended some really cool presentations this week. New book trucks are always nice, too. The last of the snow got off our lawn this week; at least, I sincerely hope it's the last of the snow until next winter. I did a lot of reading and watched some more terrible tv, including some new shows I really like. I've been tired and hazy, so I tripled my vit D intake; that helped. I just need to keep an eye on my calcium levels now, lol. I got to schedule my first vaccination shot!
** h0p3
*** [[k0sh3k]] read a lot of books and watched plenty of braincandy. Something's off, but she's not sure what; she had a good week though. Her sleep has been reasonable, even sleeping in (which is something she normally can't do, and she's able to fall asleep so quickly when she heads to bed [disgusting]). VitD has helped. She's finally allowed to get her vaccine, and she's been thinking about the pragmatics of life quite a bit. Kevin's presence is unfortunate. She's made lots of desserts (must have been in a mood, and somehow, we must induce this mode/mood more often). Her week was super productive, and she's modeling how to do it like a queen. She's been writing the story of her life and our lives, and she continues to help her offspring appreciate the world of reading like none other.
** AIR
*** @k0sh3k: She seemed to have a  very good week, lots of presentations, she was able to get a lot of reading done. she made some fantastic baked goods, got to watch some shows, she explained what Lent Madness was to multiple people causing them and Kevin to want to try it next year. 

* [[h0p3]]
** 1uxb0x
*** You don't really need to setup a sleep schedule, do you? At least, you don't for a while. Me and you have great senses of humor. I've liked playing MTG with you. It was kind of you to help mom with the pie. The maymays/memes/meems are as good as usual
** j3d1h
*** It's unfortunate that all the genius word combinations and such are stuck with the bastards on 4chan. I really do get Anon's point on the feet commission, though, and I'm not even drawing for money... Playing MTG with you has been decently fun, especially knowing I have all the bombs that you wish you had. You should stop vaping when you're literally at the table, by the way, it's bad etiquette.
** k0sh3k
*** @h0p3: MJos sounds like a nifty fella. I like that people are still contacting you and you're responding, even though you're pausified. Thank you for helping me make pie! I had fun with you this week, even though I've been not feeling great. 
** h0p3
*** [[h0p3]] spent enormous amounts of time [[TTTOTW]], [[FTO]] especially. His [[Link Log]] and [[/b/]] work were worthy. He's pushed hard, and it show. Speaking with those he loved was practically everything to him. 
** AIR
*** @h0p3: His sleep schedule is as fucked up as mine, he has been writing to a lot of people this week, way more than the usual, he has been encouraging me to get a new wiki up for myself (he has sent a lot of helpful link and some walk throughs to help me do this) he has played a lot of MTG and has been enjoying that time with his offspring. 

* [[AIR]]
** 1uxb0x
*** If I could, I'd eat that sushi forever. (Ok, maybe also pizza and Mexican food as well.) You start getting your sleep schedule set up. I'm surprised that you'd be surprised with moms baking, is there that much of a difference between cooking and baking?
** j3d1h
*** We didn't get to talk a whole lot, but that's alright. You need to rest, so it's good to hear that you're playing games and reading a bunch. I still like bouncing world and art ideas off you now and then. I'm glad the cats are actually starting to like you - I was a little worried they wouldn't get properly used to another human. Also, your links are far superior to h0p3's, thank you. :]
** k0sh3k
*** @AIR: I've continued to enjoy your food, and I'm glad you liked my desserts! I have also continued to like joking around with you. AND mostly I'm glad you were able to chill for a while without feeling bad about it!
** h0p3
*** [[AIR]] had at least two serious moments of dread, fear, or anxiety this week. He's been letting it all hang out, doing his thing, vaping, chillin, finding. LoL has been fun for him. We've seen less of him this week given his sleep schedule. It's been another week of transitions for him.
** AIR
*** @AIR: I didn't write in my journal this week. I have been relaxing and enjoying this time, it has taken a month and few weeks to get to this point, I have been sleeping, reading, playing LoL. being able to breath and not have all the stress of what I had before.
