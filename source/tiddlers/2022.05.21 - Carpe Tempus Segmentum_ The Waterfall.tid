title: 2022.05.21 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: The Waterfall

[[TTTOTW]]. No idea when I fell asleep. Maybe 1?

Woke at 8. It was enough. //Skintime// with my sympaticon, planning, [[Morning Routine]].

[[TTTOTW]]. Robot-writer [[anon]] left me a message on 4chan, quite a bit later. `/salute`. It's np, homie. Rock on.

Assignments. Mi amor decided it was worth the risk despite the advisories. 

//The Date// with mi amor. Hit the library first, but they weren't open. Plant Store said they won't sell Yaupon because it isn't suited to our climate (we have killed two off, though plenty of evidence to think it should be fine as an evergreen). 

Hiking on the trail to find the waterfalls. 5 minutes away, and it's pretty cool. Her walking stick is looking good, and I need one. I want a goldilocks one, and next time I go, I'm taking a hatchet. I want it to be about as girthy as my [[micropenis]], but slightly taller than me (still talking about the walking stick, ofc). Mi amor took pics, and [[Madman's Photo Slideshow]] is born. I took off my shoes and socks and let my feet dangle in the cold water. We encountered some Remote Control stoners, chill group. Stephen talked to me, so I replied and carded his ass, `/wave`. 

Shopping @ Home Depot with mi amor. I picked up a window scraper and a heavier duty two-handed (though quite short) one that I can sharpen. I really need a table and a vice. Electric grind wheel like Mr. Cosby would be useful. She got the last enamel type paint in the store, and it was opened so they gave us a discount. Since I've tore up my knees through the knee pads I've got (so easy to do with Osgood-Schlatter), I picked up a better set (tested them in the store). 

We got nicely cheap Mexican food from that dead food truck.

Set up a hammock stand for mi amor. It's pleasant having all the tools we need. Quick job. Happy Birthday, mi amor.

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. //Inform the Men!// //Raw Skintime// with mi amor. A cold drank and chill. Shower of the gods!

Chillax with my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]]. A bit of [[D2]]. Dadnap hit hard.

Woke at 8? Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. 

Ice cream and wedges with sauce (thank you to my daughter for having left these for us :P). [[TTTOTW]].

[[D2]]. Twerk found 2x Skillers, 2x Pul, 3x Lem, 2x Um, and a Gul. My sympaticon's Assassin is 24 now. The ramp is up. [[TTTOTW]].
