title: 2021.11.18 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Ancestry

!! Respond to the following:

<<<
In terms of religion and spirituality, ask yourself these questions: Whatever ancestry you think you have, does it really give you the right over anything? Do you own your ancestors? All of them? Or just the ones you specifically picked and disregarded the rest? And do you know all of them? What right do you have to choose ones over others? Why do you make such distinctions? Do you own the gods? Are certain gods only yours to worship, venerate, adore? They will only listen to you because of your cultural heritage and the religion, spirituality and ancestry you have chosen? What about religious symbols? Are they really yours? Are they registered trademarks? You own specific symbols because part of your ancestors also used those symbols? Do you know if such symbols and if your ancestors had the same morals, values, wishes, meanings than you have today? Is a tradition yours? Are you so special and so mighty and powerful that you can own a culture? Reflect upon this, please.

> Whatever ancestry you think you have, does it really give you the right over anything?

Prima facie, the answer seems to be no. However, there is a careful interpretation of this question in which the answer may be a maybe, and I think likely in a manner that is counterintuitive and not so easy to attack as something like racism. 

So, as usual, it depends on how you want to define our ancestry. Genetic ancestry is not the only kind I'm concerned with; memetic ancestry  seems just as crucial to who and what we are. If you mean to say that I am a person who comes from a set of ancestors who were also people, then, yes, perhaps this does generate some Hohfeldian claim rights. I [[share]] a right to use non-person parts of The World with [[other]] persons [[irwartfrr]], particularly as these ought to be means to ends in themselves. However, this isn't a crucial connection to me; each person could arise randomly (yet, I'm not convinced I can generate a terribly plausible causal story of memetic development for such a thing) and I'd be able to say something similar (but, I also cannot claim that is not a type of ancestry either, however odd it may initially appear - and, yes, as philosophers, we'll stretch a concept until it breaks). I also have the right to make judgments about my ancestors in many cases, and that is perhaps in virtue of having them as my ancestors to some non-trivial [[dok]]. Note, of course, that there may be many species that meet the minimal viable conditions for personhood. Further, an object's ancestors may be persons, but this does imply the object is a person. I have no idea how to wisely draw the threshold of Dasein well enough. 

> Do you own your ancestors? All of them? Or just the ones you specifically picked and disregarded the rest?

What does it mean to own your ancestors? What does it mean to own a past object? I normally think of current ownership as being more concerned with the present and future. Perhaps there are Hohfeldian structures that are quite similar between past and [present or future]. I'll bite. I'll take up the claim we can currently own objects in the past, even if there is no way to practically enforce at least aspects of it (note how claim rights that could be enforced are likely only with respect to a present or future object - are you sure you don't mean to pick out the abstract object rather than a physical instantiation itself here?). Is telling and interpreting the history of one's ancestors a particular type of ownership of some branch of their extended dialectical identities? Looks like it. This ownership is not necessarily in virtue of the fact that they are my ancestors, though perhaps even that has its own type.

This line of questioning runs much deeper than it looks to a Kantian. It is a matter of the Kingdom of Ends.

As [[SNilsen]] correctly identifies: [[The Golden Rule]] is at the infinite meta level of games, where there is no higher meta level. There are no exceptions. Though we do not merely "follow the rules of the game if you want others to follow the rules," but because all ought follow the rules of the game. And, here, you see the symmetry of the moral calculus that we do not even own ourselves all the way down, nor did those among our ancestors who were persons, nor do any persons in any possible world. It is the [[CI]]. And, here, you will see that the nature of ownership, a Hohfeldian structure, binds us all together (even if we choose not to be bound by the moral law, it governs none-the-less), we are equals at some level, we own each [[other]] with each [[other]] together. The answer is: to some [[dok]] I do have a claim right on my ancestors, as I do on any person, as every person has on me as well. Do you know what it means to own anything? 

Note, of course, how there are some ancestors which were not people. The landmarks of genetic (long before memetic) Eves that eventually led to the evolution of creatures like Humans with emergent Daseinic properties are my ancestors in some respects (sublation brought me about, and I'm open to the claim these lifeforms eventually had enough self-awareness that they were not merely like the rocks floating through the space [and I know this too is a hard problem assumption!], but more, with privileged positions above mere dust), but they are not persons. They do not have a consciousness like ours, or at least the odds are low enough that we are rational in making the assumption that their point of view (as a single-celled organism) isn't as epistemically and morally privileged as ours. I do not know what it means to have a claim right on such a thing, as I have no Nozickian legitimate acquisition model (whereas our collective ownership of ourselves as persons spans spacetime, into all dimensions, to "the 11th" and so forth, if that means anything). Thus, my initial instinct is to say I only own parts of some of my ancestors in virtue of the fact that they also own parts of me.

I have a function that picks them out, but I don't take myself to be picking them out through undue bias. It's a discovery, not an invention. The teleosemantic line of differentiation, a matter of moral agency, is necessary for evening beginning to talk about the possibility of ownership at all. 

> And do you know all of them? 

No. Obviously not. I can't. I can only attempt to approximate in some respects. That goes for living people too!

> What right do you have to choose ones over others? 

If my previous answer doesn't clear that up, then I have a follow-up clarification question: what gives anyone the right to anything? Answer that question well, and you'll know my answer (and I'll know quite a bit about who you really are too - no one ever actually skirts around this issue with me). Here I get to handle you as though you may be a quietist. Justify why you have any rights at all, please. I'm putting my skin in the game with you.

> Why do you make such distinctions? 

Dasein categorically does not perceive anything without a telos. If you think it merely hypothetical, then you've already violated the fundamental law. It's not like you're going to escape making distinctions here either.

> Do you own the gods? 

God? No. God No! Lol. Tell me what consists in a god? If you mean to pick out ends in themselves, then I've already handed you the basic answers. Saint Aristotle's concern about the unification of [[The Good]] remains the most fundamental problem, and [[The Absolute]] is beyond all else. I do not know what it means to own such a thing, and I do not claim it is a person or that it can own anything. I do not know what it is well enough (and, I'm an expert in being lost AF in that desert). 

However, I will agree we morally own each other, and we are ends in ourselves up until the end in [[Itself]]. It is a mutual ownership. Yet again, it is a matter of The Golden Rule. As another example, I can quickly suss out who has actually been married and who only has a piece of paper to signal with. Yet again, Christianity picked out a very hard 3-Body problem quite well here (though, it is exceedingly rare to find anyone who self-identifies as one who is actually), though I obviously I do not agree to any personal God; I remain violently agnostic on that matter.

> Are certain gods only yours to worship, venerate, adore? 

That which can worship, venerate, and adore ought to uphold [[The Good]] and that of [[The Other]] along with all the rest of us who can (and therefore ought). I will agree that there may be modes of these activities in which only some can engage in, but only in virtue of accident, [[moral luck]], and mere circumstance; all else being equal, all who can ought. 

> They will only listen to you because of your cultural heritage and the religion, spirituality and ancestry you have chosen? 

That is quite an assumption. Are you purposely avoiding the possibility of my class of answers here?

I will agree that we stand in opposition to dark-triadicism. Insofar as it is people listening to people (the "they", as it were, in likely a weaker sense than you imply), it is not a matter of if they will only listen, but about whether or not they ought, and why. 

> What about religious symbols? Are they really yours? Are they registered trademarks? You own specific symbols because part of your ancestors also used those symbols? 

What is a symbol? Can you pick out what is not a symbol for me, please? If you are realist, we are caught with a difficulty in accepting that the representation is also sufficiently the thing-in-itself (and if you're not, gg, pwned). I do not claim this is unacceptable (far from it), but it poses several kinds of problems. There may be religious symbols that can be owned by others which I cannot own (seems likely in the ownership acquisition and transfer stories). There may be religious symbols (as even each token of a type is still a symbol) that are mine, though, note, of course, that the ownership of the symbol need not necessarily imply ownership of what it symbolizes. We cannot own an idea anymore so than anyone else. These are non-rivalrous objects, and the appearance of ownership of such a thing is merely coincidental, double effect parasitic upon the fundamental reasons we may or may not use our minds to grasp and wield ideas in various contexts, and so forth. 

I'm entirely opposed to standard moral rights to IP, but (and, we're talking cutting edge analytic moral philosophy here - and I am an expert here) to use our minds at all, there are rights and duties to use abstract objects, and therein lies the only remaining morally valid concept of IP. So, technically, there are cases that are functionally similar to trademarks, but it is not in virtue of any standard acquisition and transfer model. Therefore, whatever is wrong about using any such thing would be in virtue of some other moral crime, e.g. deception and using others as mere means. I can generate ad hoc cases in which one would own specific symbols in virtue of their ancestors having used those symbols. Prima facie, however, we have no reason to think this is generally the case.

Are you concerned with our moral obligations in interpreting, discovering, and generating symbols? I'm all ears, homie. I'm not convinced you're going to like where this is going in the end though. The problem of representation is fundamentally religious, so I think it's not so easy to peel out religious symbols from all the others. Life is religious. It is the ground of all being in our [[phenomenology]].

> Do you know if such symbols and if your ancestors had the same morals, values, wishes, meanings than you have today? 

This is one of Saint Wittgenstein's basic points, right? Do you think we can understand each others' interpretations of symbols at all? If so, I think we have reason to think we do know (recall that I take up justification as the core concept of knowledge, including into inconsistency and incompleteness) what even our ancestors believed. Do you want to clarify your question? I think you've got some conversational implicature embedded in it that we should examine.

> Is a tradition yours? Are you so special and so mighty and powerful that you can own a culture? 

I think I've answered these questions sufficiently. 

> Reflect upon this, please.

You got it, boss. That's my job.
