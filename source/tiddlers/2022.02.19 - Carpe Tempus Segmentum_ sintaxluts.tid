title: 2022.02.19 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: sintaxluts

Left Lounge at 1:15. Instant sleep.

Woke at 8:30. Meditation. Fireman Time!

//Skintime// with my sympaticon + planning. Someone took an aspie test, and she won, she beat it, passed it wif thlying colors, `/nod`. 

A wild Mendax peeks...`/wave`

[[TTTOTW]]. [[Variety Creepy]] is typing...

Made breakfast (eggs and millennial toast). Assignments. Ate with mi amor and my sympaticon in [[The Den]]. [[/b/]]eing together is my privilege. //Skintime// with mi amor, bed and otherwise. Confirmation on her meds, again. 

Acquired //Mochi// the Honda, blessed be her name.<<ref "i">> Pretty smooth. We took out a personal loan that went straight to our bank accounts to move to CT. Same thing in this case, as it beat the rates of everything else (and, I anticipate that inflation will continue to be to our benefit here); the first time we've ever bought a vehicle not with our own money up front.

Hit the library to get stuff. Grabbed a copy of //Wage Theft in America: Why Millions of Working Americans Are Not Getting Paid And What We Can Do About It// off the free shelf (normally, I wouldn't take a book, as I have too much codexical mobility trauma as it is). I wandered, a lot. Living meditation. Pacing. Talking to myself, [[others]], in all the worlds, lost in these stacks of books.<<ref "s">> Save me from these words, bathe me in light, and calm these jitters.

My daughter and I fought with boffers today. They are very long (probably 5ft in length), and they will make your nose bleed.

Me,<<ref "ni">> mi amor, and my sympaticon hit the CVS to get pictures for passports (need to schedule for all of us to finish the paperwork, but we need to make sure everyone has what they need first...should be otw). We had a good time, especially since my job was to make [[ASK]] smile when she's not allowed to during picture-taking time. Oh, found a display perch for that quasi-socialist propaganda book (but I fucking forgot to card it, god fucking damnaerwotijasfd;ae4irt5q345r). I wish you [[luck]] on the journey, [[nomad]]. `/salute`.

Saw it at tha lieberry, so had to get it. //Gramma Lessons//<<ref "pg">> (thank you lieberry) and //The Ultimate Guide To Cunnilingus// (ty [[anon]]) now sit next to my usual spot in //The Commons//. Very important talking pieces.<<ref "x">> =D. 

Daughter and I seem to be going hard in our playfulness, to the point that she wishes she didn't escalate.

[[TTTOTW]]. Accidental restart. `/sigh`. That reset button is wildly too easy to trigger. I may unwire it. Bad news: [[MuWire]] [[contact]] and trust-marking list is gone (and, I'd covered pretty much every user for months). There is a reason I should be able to copy and paste information into and out of an application (much like a VM too*). I have saved the vital keys in the ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±, and, ofc, I could hunt them all down again. I am convinced it is not worth my time now. That's a big error. Happy to be on the network seeding hard though.

Autist.exe: I've got a new physical keyring setup for [[h0p3: EDC]]. A lot of keys removed, headed for the box. Down to a ring for the vehicles, ring for house/etc., and a ring for tools. Using a thick tiny one to bind the three, and a master through the four. Seems to have a looseness I prefer for stimming, but with quick organization when pulled from the center. Probably still the wrong way to do it. =).

//The Walk// with my sympaticon. Cold AF and already snowing (not sticking) when we started (we had to head back to get my thick coat). 10% of the way through, national weather alert. We got hit with a snowsquall. Neat. Take my breath away catch my breath moments; we are out of shape. =D.

//Skintime// with mi amor. She's studying Greek, but feeling ahead and confident (neat). St. John's for my daughter looks so amazing. I wish she understood. Mi amor took me to the room. //Inform the Men!// Meditation. Shower of the gods!

Making food. [[TTTOTW]]. People were wandering. Salad + Tendies + Sauces + cool drank + //Skintime// with both mi amor and my sympaticon while we all watched //Raised by Wolves// (2020), two episodes. Plenty to chew on it in. I think it's a winner for all of us.

//Skintime// with mi amor as she [[TTTOTW]]. Should probably give her more time to wind down on her own. `/nod`. Soaking up every moment.

[[TTTOTW]].

Massage for my sympaticon + //ATLA//.

No idea what time I fell asleep.
