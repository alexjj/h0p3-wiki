I am, of course, a paranoid schizo autist, so perhaps I'm just seeing things. If that move is what I think it was, it was clever. You didn't do anything wrong either. If there is a fault, it's mine. I can be slow to speak in person offline; I [[hope]] you can forgive my rudeness. Perhaps there's something like serendipity to the event. See you on the trails, sir. `/salute`
