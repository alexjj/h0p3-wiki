[05:39:12] Galaxian: hey dude :)
[05:39:39] h0p3: Hello there, friend. How's your day going?
[05:39:50] Galaxian: going well :) you?
[05:40:34] h0p3: The endless grind for answers. I cannot complain. It's different tonight as well. It is quiet around me, with no people. A rare occassion these days. 
[05:40:58] Galaxian: i like a calm house also :)
[05:41:53] h0p3: We are highly-strung, incredibly sensitive freaks here at [[The Alien Asylum]]. Calm is appreciable, especially in oscillation. 
[05:42:03] h0p3: What you up to today?
[05:42:16] Galaxian: nothing much
[05:42:24] Galaxian: i update my RS chanel
[05:44:24] h0p3: Don't have your channel. What's the title?
[05:44:43] Galaxian: Series in FRENCH
[05:44:49] Galaxian: FILMS in FRENCH
[05:45:15] Galaxian: Series in MULTI&VOSTFR
[05:45:32] Galaxian: MULTI is FR/EN
[05:46:03] h0p3: Added
[05:46:31] h0p3: Wish that were easier to discover in the tool.
[05:49:53] Galaxian: retroshare:/''''/channel?name=S%C3%A9ries%20en%20MULTI%20ou%20VOSTFR&id=f10bf67e1a404e7678ee4ff686cedb22

[05:50:13] h0p3: Already joined.
[05:50:17] Galaxian: ok :)
[05:53:28] Galaxian: most of my MULTI is 1080p
[05:53:44] h0p3: That's my preference. I don't see the point in going 4k.
[05:54:05] Galaxian: is it you who takes Andor star wars?
[05:54:18] h0p3: But, I'm switching back to 128kbps mp3s as well.
[05:54:23] Galaxian: ok
[05:54:45] h0p3: Nope. Already have it. I almost never use file[[sharing]] networks other than torrents these days. 
[05:54:49] h0p3: for downloading*
[05:54:55] Galaxian: same
[05:55:09] Galaxian: if i download, it's to share
[05:56:47] Galaxian: i don't have the time to see all i have lol
[05:58:09] Galaxian: it would take me 10 or 20 years lol
[05:58:36] h0p3: `/nod`.
[05:59:47] h0p3: I've seen (or tasted*) most of what shows up in my torrents folder. I tend to have consumed the rest of what I shared (usually multiple times). I want to be comfortable even without internet access. 
[06:00:01] Galaxian: ok
[06:00:02] h0p3: And, to carry those pieces of media I think are most [[salient]]. 
[06:01:26] h0p3: Had to cancel fiber yesterday (wasn't really working). Was going to move to seeding on open trackers. Racing, trying to make it so that those who joined the swarm would have a good one, and so that it would be harder for most clients to reach 1 ratio (some percentage of which will seed longer). 
[06:01:36] h0p3: A monkeywrench in my plans. 
[06:01:57] Galaxian: i have fiber since more than 6 month
[06:02:01] h0p3: So jelly
[06:02:03] Galaxian: it's really fast
[06:02:21] h0p3: The upload speed is what I really want.
[06:03:39] Galaxian: i can upload at 80MB/sec
[06:03:46] Galaxian: and dl at 110MB/sec
[06:03:48] h0p3: Gotdayum. Hawtness.
[06:33:37] Galaxian: do you work? or study?
[06:33:52] h0p3: I would say both. I do not get paid or recognized for either.
[06:34:00] Galaxian: oh... :/
[06:34:33] h0p3: It's fine. I am quite privileged to be able to engage in my vocation.
[06:34:52] Galaxian: :)
[06:36:39] h0p3: How about you? How do you survive in the world?
[06:41:58] Galaxian: i tried to work long ago, but i can't, i have a psychic illness
[06:42:19] h0p3: `/nod`. I hear that.
[06:42:43] Galaxian: france gives me around 900€ per month becaus eof it
[06:42:45] Galaxian: of*
[06:43:19] h0p3: I can imagine it takes some doing to live within those constraints. 
[06:43:42] Galaxian: i live with my mother, we share money for house
[06:43:54] h0p3: Good.
[06:46:40] Galaxian: we have 2 house, one we live in, and one is for people who book it and they give money
[06:46:43] Galaxian: houses*
[06:46:59] h0p3: I see. Long-term tenants or short-term?
[06:47:20] Galaxian: depend, last people staied 1.5 years
[06:47:50] Galaxian: now we are looking for enw ones
[06:47:53] Galaxian: new*
[06:48:07] Galaxian: we had some work to do for the house
[06:48:31] h0p3: Do you do the maintenance and construction for it?
[06:48:46] Galaxian: yes
[06:48:51] h0p3: Noice.
[06:49:21] Galaxian: we know people who can do the work
[06:51:51] Galaxian: we live in the house of my grand mother
[06:52:02] h0p3: That is a privilege.
[06:52:16] Galaxian: yes, she is gone in 2020 :/
[06:52:26] h0p3: I'm sorry for your loss. 
[06:52:28] h0p3: What was she like?
[06:52:37] Galaxian: she was 96yo
[06:52:45] h0p3: Noice. 
[06:53:09] Galaxian: she felt nothing, she had vein in her day which broke
[06:53:29] Galaxian: she was in very good health
[06:53:34] Galaxian: could walk and such
[06:53:39] Galaxian: very well
[06:54:11] Galaxian: not day, head*
[06:54:17] Galaxian: brain i mean
[13:08:41] Galaxian: hi again :)
[13:08:44] Galaxian: all is ok?
[14:35:00] h0p3: All is good. Just got up from sleeping. =)
[17:06:18] Galaxian: me, going to sleep, see you tomorrow :)

[03:36:32] Galaxian: hi :) how are you?
[03:38:23] h0p3: Yo. 
[03:38:40] h0p3: Finishing off //Red Rising// with my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]]. Finished a lot of work. Prepping the house for winter.
[03:38:51] h0p3: How about you, homie?
[03:38:58] Galaxian: ok :) i'm fine thanks
[03:39:21] Galaxian: just woke up
[03:39:31] h0p3: I'll be heading to bed here soon.
[03:39:35] h0p3: 3:40am.
[03:39:41] Galaxian: oh, yes it's late
[03:39:44] Galaxian: or early ;)
[03:40:24] Galaxian: 9:40 am for me
[03:52:32] Galaxian: did you download files from my RS channel lately?
[03:52:43] h0p3: No, sir. 
[03:52:50] Galaxian: :)
[03:58:21] Galaxian: can you browse my RS?
[03:58:29] h0p3: I just did, sir. Tons. 
[03:58:43] Galaxian: i did post them, byt i share movies in multi 1080p, a lot
[03:58:55] h0p3: `/nod`.
[03:59:01] Galaxian: didn't*
[03:59:10] Galaxian: but*
[03:59:48] Galaxian: i download lot of movies from Gazzz
[03:59:55] Galaxian: i share them
[04:01:05] h0p3: I've used Retroshare since it came out many moons ago, off and on, and I've never found many people who were interested in downloading on that network.
[04:01:22] Galaxian: ok
[04:02:02] h0p3: I have no idea why. You'd think it would be a bigger deal. The network has always had whales sharing their hoards.
[04:07:02] Galaxian: when tor wasn't under attack, i could send around 200GB per 24h
[04:07:48] Galaxian: since tor is attacked, i've made a second node, with i2p tor and clearnet@vpn
[04:10:50] Galaxian: i own Galaxian and poi
[04:11:03] h0p3: Throughput hasn't been my issue. Perhaps I've just not been hosting files people want (but, I'm kinda surprised by that, as all other networks seem to download more). 
[04:11:30] Galaxian: before my channels i had nearly nobody downloading by me
