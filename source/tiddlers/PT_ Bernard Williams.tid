* The possibility of knowledge of any kind depends on the possibility of an "absolute conception" of the world.
* An objective "absolute conception" of the world can be attained through natural science.
* Knowledge is possible only if its possibility can be scientifically comprehended.
* There can be no external reasons for action; once they enter into our explanations of our actions, they become internal.
* Ethical truth can only be local and historically contingent (not timeless or universal), based on reasons deriving from peoples' actual motives and practices.
* We blame people not only for what they have voluntarily done, but also for what they have done as a matter of luck ("moral luck").
* A utilitarian assessment of duty is a form of alienation because the agent's own welfare counts simply as someone else's welfare.
* There is a distinction between the history of ideas (focusing on the historical context) and the history of philosophy which is part of philosophy.
* Historically impoverished, reductionist styles of philosophy and science stand in the way of our understanding who we are.
