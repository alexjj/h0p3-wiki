title: 2021.01.10 - Prompted Introspection: A Question For The World

!! If you could ask everybody in the world a question, what would it be? You don't get to hear their answers.

I have many I want to ask. [[Question Everything]], of course. Most people do not question the nature of their [[phenomenology]], doubt their relationship to reality, [[aim]] to justly [[know themselves|Know Thyself]], pursue [[Justice]] with and for [[others]], or deeply inquire into the coherence (or lackthereof) and foundations [to, of, surrounding, or regarding] their [[faith]]s. What questions wake people up such that they generate fitting epistemic humility, doubt, curiosity, responsibility, and justified virtue? I do not know. I must guess.

There is a difference between choosing the fitting question in which everyone would honestly attempt to answer and choosing a question given my assumptions of how most people would feel and react to it, a question that would ultimately ignore most of the population to target those who would most likely change in virtue of having been asked the question, a question of realpolitik influence, propagandistic marketing, and predicted memetic efficacy. It if is the former, note that I can nest "all" the questions into one. You must be asking about the latter.

I have no idea. I'm sorry. I need time to come up with a list.
