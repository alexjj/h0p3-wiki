title: 2021.12.22 - Kevin Kovacs: Check-in

Hey h0p3,

It’s been awhile and I know its mostly my fault. You had asked me about Pinephone and I thought about it a bit, but honestly didn’t know where to start… and continue to not know how to voice an opinion as I haven’t educated myself on what Pinephone really is (as much as I love the open web Linux is still beyond me…) so I sat on it until now…

Anyways, just wanted to check-in and see how you’re doing. I pop-in on the wiki from time to time and all appears well, but it’s tough to get a read from the occasional tiddler.

Lastly, curious what your favorite media things have been this year. I know your libraries don’t go by year, but I love seeing when you drop an opinion about a tv show. Would love to know how you look at movies, tv, albums, (podcasts if you listen), etc. in 2021.

Hope all is well.

Cheers,
