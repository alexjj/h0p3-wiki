All hail the reductive Emotional Quotientist secularized morality plays optimizing workforce productivity in pursuit of the highest possible [[good]], the one true God: GDP. These neoliberalized self-help professional facades are immoral moralizings that tend to only strengthen the positioning of vampires among us. (And, I know how low your bar is:) Who was the last person with an MBA you would call wise and radically kind to people they've never met or could benefit from? Most act blind to anything not in their self-interest and purposely curate a life that allows them to masquerade as someone with sufficient empathy. Here's what empathy often requires in the market: hunt down the big lies people tell themselves; it's often the only way to know who they really are.

Roughly as dangerous as "that's //just// your opinion", the phrase "doesn't hurt anyone" is a redflag. It has all the flaws of conveniently minimalist and unreflective assertions of the non-aggression principle. Sure, let's think about the implications of our freedom, opportunity costs, and causation: the outcome is uglier than you want to admit. Yeah, the way out is to learn to be unbothered by it: just live and let live. Uh huh. Yeah. Okay. `/silently-screams-in-millennialese`. Until the [[pleft]] accepts the necessity of realism given the primacy of metaphysics, it cannot answer capitalism (though, sadly, even if it does, my prediction is still disheartening). Doubt those who claim authority, especially including yourself, but doubting there's a justification at all is a fundamental error often at the bottom of Libertarian one-liners infecting the world with the Rand-Locke Memeplex.

To my heart's xenodata hackers: when I see you, its beat accelerates faster than the technocapital singularity.

You melanin-deficient mayo-monkey bleach-demon PONC. XD.

Most work in capitalism is low-paying, alienating, unappreciated (even when "essential"), anti-union, customer-worshipping, chronically understaffed, inconsistently scheduled, purposely bureaucratic credential hunting packed in exploitative prosperity-gospel manifest destiny rebranding. Mere survival requires a self-commodification that fragments us into schizos distributing across so many roles we can almost never fairly construct ourselves.
