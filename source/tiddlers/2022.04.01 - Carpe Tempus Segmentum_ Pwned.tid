title: 2022.04.01 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Pwned

Woke at 3. Meditation. Pushed brix. SC2 + Leftover enchilada + horchata + millennial toast. [[TTTOTW]]. Setting meetings with [[5c0ut]], 1st/2nd and 15th/16th.

She's up. Not enough sleep, but still a good mood. Excited about class. Told me to go back to bed because I look dead. Feel it (but not in a bad way, just the grind taking its toll). Sleep again by 6:50.

Woke at 10. I feel solid. Meditation.

//Skintime// with my sympaticon. Planning. Fireman Time! Leftover enchiladas and tea. [[TTTOTW]]. [[MTG]] with my sympaticon. MWC +1 vs Gobbos mull to 5. She demolished me, ending pulse + humility + top engine, with an unknown wrath in hand upon concession. [[TTTOTW]].

Shopping @ W-Entity with my sympaticon. Meds, breads, noodles, and a few other assorted foods. Out in the world without a mask; it is surprising. 

We literally broke bread and said a prayer in the kitchen. I also got kicked in the stomach. We had a good time with Ranga and shittalking. [[TTTOTW]].

Called the IRS up, waded through the system, and they said they were too busy to take a call right now. Must be hell over there. `/nod`.

[[D2]] with the trio. We re-geared. Sugar was stripped (not the in the good way) for parts. Spirit sword'n'board and vipermagi for the Hammerdin (which is so awkward compared to Zeal, but we have shit for gear). Didn't have to say much about the spec. I think he understands it, although the mechanics and gear of the game are some remaining pieces to research. Very strong for Baal runs, obviously. I think we hit 73. I tried half a dozen variations of NeckRomancer's skilling, and I'm not convinced anything is really worthy. Bone Armor is too conditional, and it's not like a ridiculous gain for the points. Maybe Dim Vision to make unwinnable gloam encounters winnable is the right way. It's how I managed on my Assassin in hell mode too. One-point wonders, including Bone Spirit (since we do have 2 Insight users now), then dumping in Revive. I worry that at some point controlling the screen includes inhibiting the PCs themselves. Given the 75% slow poker on the merc (do I really need to go for my standard CB route...maybe, as I'll be the only source of physical damage), I tried the ol' Fire Golem out again. If we were rich, I'd try Iron. Still not convinced, but Golem Mastery might make it possible to just have my own perma insight or better (though this doesn't free anyone else up).<<ref "d2">> Maybe with +12 All Skills I'd be able to actually go for a tertiary source of damage. Classic problem, and nothing like Classic D2 itself. Everyone is still getting a feel for their characters and roles, but it is getting smoother. We might actually take down the Ubers, lol. Baal himself could be `/players 99` (were such a thing to wonderfully exist) for all I care, as Holy Freeze, 40-75% slow from my merc/clay, Decrepify, and the constant melee interrupts, he's completely stunlocked for as long as we want. Never grouped for Ubers, so we'll see how that goes. 

[[ASK]] made smores fudge (with a smore layer on top).

Assignments.

//The Walk// with mi amor. Vapelyfe. Just the U, as the storm was coming and it got cold real fast. Some rough parenting in the neighborhood. M has a target on her back (a holdover acolyte from the original S, which is for sociopath*). SZ is doing all the work to get the trigger pulled (as she is the only person who could even begin to make progress on it). 

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. She really only needs enough Greek to be the expert librarian, but she doesn't actually need to be able to exegete the whole shebang at elite levels (though there are the Johannine scriptures). Kinda a build-a-bear 6 year degree here, with elective space in any graduate program at the school (with exceptions for logic, this wasn't possible for analytic philosophy). Might as well go whole-hog on whatever it would take for bibliotherapy certification and chaplaincy. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. 

Prepared dinner with my sympaticon.

[[TTTOTW]]. Mi amor came down to grind with me.

[[Family Gathering]] was outstanding. We had pork smothered in a sauce with couscous and veggies. Watched The Black Hole episode of //House//. Vapelyfe.

-=[ Rabbitholed ]=-

Put mi amor to bed. Put my sympaticon to couch. Fell asleep at 10? Pwned.

<<footnotes "d2" "Alright, think the lowest possible damage Insight would make it so he at least wouldn't kill himself while cursed (I'm fine if he has shit for base physical damage, as I've got other junk here). My merc is the best source of slow for a long time, and I'm not betting on having a replacement anytime soon. Means shittier CE, but, like, so what? Hammerdin has the AoE. Alright, done. Max Golem Mastery, and let's see if I can figure out a way not to die. =D.">>
