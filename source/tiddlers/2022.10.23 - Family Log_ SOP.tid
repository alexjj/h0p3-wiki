!! What was interesting to you last week?

* !!!!!!!!!!!!F I B E R!!!!!!!!!!!! (´༎ຶ ͜ʖ ༎ຶ) 
* [[5c0ut]] and [[j3d1h]] are sick. Different things, I think.
* //Alphabet of Thorn//, LoL Worlds, //Mr. Robot// (I WILL NOT BE OWNED!), //Rick and Morty//, several books and shows in exploration
* [[The Salient Cube]] is ready! Construction to explore it has been fun.
* Art group.
* These long johns have been dope.
* CAPOW bread, ice cream, nog, and pudding were delicious.
* Serious connection issues with [[k0sh3k]]'s phone.
* The coronation of Xi.
* I may be parting with my beloved mouse soon.
* Not the symposium. 
* So. Much. Greek. 
* Finally figured out how to walk DMR; now we just have to shift everything. 
* JJ is the best. 
* My weeks been alright, got laundry done-have no clue where my towels went though. Gonna try some new things to wake up because I think it's just ingrained into my mind to lay down in bed and sleep for as much as possible. My shoulder pains gone. I think I'm going through a growth spurt and am wondering if that's effecting my emotional balance.
* Edited for everyone else's comfort. I can't complain. It's against the rules. 
** 'Interest is such a strong word. Oh. Wait. Figuring out that my motives, mood, and meaning e democratically determined with no input or vote from me made me jump out of the discussion pool. I see why he freaks out beyond sanity over collusion and "putting words in my mouth". That is SOP around here.'
