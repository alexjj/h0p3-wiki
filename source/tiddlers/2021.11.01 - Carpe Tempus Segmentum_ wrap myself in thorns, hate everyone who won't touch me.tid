title: 2021.11.01 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: wrap myself in thorns, hate everyone who won't touch me

Fireman Time! [[ASK]]ing, rabbitholing, and //Skintime//. 

Sleep by 3:30. 

Woke at Noon. Fireman Time! Hugs'n'bugs. Broski is in a good mood, cookin' up a storm. No food for him atm. Very important prep. =D.<<ref "i">> Coffee and Jamaican Hotpockets. [[ASK]]'s heart isn't feeling right, so no walking for now. [[TTTOTW]] + LoLWorlds (finding myself lacking time for it).

[[Family Time]] was simple and good. Both [[ASK]] and [[5c0ut]] joined us. From what I gather, it's pretty expensive for people to read what everyone has written on the spot. The conversation was solid though (it's not always). I was able to complete most of the task [[m20]].

The Meal was insane. [[5c0ut]] had spent all day cooking Indian food. I have no idea what to call it besides curry (ironically). Meat was on the side, his bright pickled veggies, and naan too. Dev joined us for dinner (I even put on a shirt for the event). Lots of kids came to door for their bouncy balls and books/writing implements. I was my usual quiet self in front of guests. Good to see the tables filled.  

//Coraline// with 7 people down in [[The Den]]. We had donuts too (my daughter guarding them jealously). I barely paid attention, as I continued to rice and configure [[monster]]-20. Bad news on the LineageOS front, as the device's submodel isn't supported and SafetyNet banking still has a hard time working, even with Magisk hax. De-googled what little I could otherwise. Fuck it; I can only trust the device so far anyway. Google has done a fine job of continuing to tighten their grip over the last 6 years. VNC'd into chroot of Arch Linux with XFCE on this phone, and the browser benchmarks are actually competing with FF on [[m16]] in many spots (handily defeating m18 almost across the board too). That's fucking crazy. It's cuh-rushin the [[Pinephone]] (it's bad when the shitty Termux + VNC approach gives a full desktop experience that trounces a native mobile distro [even if it's just shoestring spaghetti and gum]). I'm impressed by the polish of most of it too (still finding bugs). We always say it's a turing machine, it's a [[computer]] in the fundamental sense that our desktops are, it technically runs ~~GNU/~~Linux, etc. This is the first time I've used a phone and felt it wasn't a toy (even though it lacks ownership in many respects, like the [[Pinephone]]) or a huge step down in raw compute [[power]] (that [[awe]] may die down though: we'll see). Yeah, it still lacks the ergonomics a retard like me needs in a desktop, but it's shockingly functional. Unfortunately, a full DE is still burning too much electricity, and I'm not convinced yet that even just a headless approach is going to work (even if we go Alpine and tried to work on conserving power). 

[[TTTOTW]] and chilled with [[ASK]] for a bit, but I just couldn't stay awake. Sleep by 11?

Woke at 7:30. Ugh. I need at least another cycle, but it's not gonna happen. I'm awake. //Skintime// and wikitalk with [[ASK]]. I think typing practice is in order. [[Morning Routine]]. Hugs'n'bugs. Apples, mandarins, pringles, ice cream, and water. [[TTTOTW]]. Hugs'n'bugs. [[TTTOTW]] + LoLWorlds (I'm way behind). Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. [[ASK]]ing. Leftovers and Hugs'n'bugs with [[5c0ut]]. [[TTTOTW]].

My son and I cleaned and painted the garage floor. It's something like a purple. I'm glad [[ASK]] likes it. My daughter's been cute but deadly UwU with a dose of negative feelings. There's been a lot of dismissal from her lately. Genuine discussion may grow harder to come by. =/. She did some work on [[Rust]] though.

As I was leaving to take my offspring on a walk, [[JRE]] called. It was nearly a two hour conversation. Nm on shift change? He's moving to 2nd, and that's going to be a significant change in their habits. Boys were cute for Halloween. We talked [[Dune]], and he was surprised by my reaction. Talked some about //Midnight Mass// and //Hereditary// as well. Stories which made him feel like he had objective purpose "fucked him up," but there's not much I can say as he goes over [[Positive Nihilism]] yet again. I offer limited opinions that I've spoken of plenty in the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱. I'll politely listen, as that's the best I can do. Walking me through the [[pleft]]ists he's been listening to. He got a vertical mouse. I had to end the call because I had received two calls in a row, back to back, the last being my wife (so I was worried, as she was over an hour late). She was all good, but disappointed.

I didn't end up walking. Okay. Dadnap during TableTime. 

//Skintime// with mi amor. Her day sucked. She does a good job protecting the people she has power over; I'm disappointed but not surprised by how expectations are based so thoroughly on mere appearance. People have no idea what they should be ashamed of (and that is something they should be ashamed of). I don't think she's going to aggressively just takeover the office. I think we both felt like we spun our wheels today and accomplished little.

[[Family Gathering]] was very late (timing on dinner was off), but it was good. We're breaking off into side conversations more often, and there's less of a focus. I'm glad to see my son and [[ASK]] getting along so well (not surprised, of course). We had ribs, wedges, sprouts, and I had a fizzy drink plus candy. //Skintime// with mi amor as we watched the Esther episode of //House//. Best season.

[[ASK]]ing. Final Hugs'n'bugs. Put mi amor to bed (I'm glad to see she's consuming some trash). [[TTTOTW]] + LoLWorlds. [[5c0ut]] pointed out how [[ASK]]'s bells are helluva lot like my beads: stim hard, 'tists. I've bought a room divider.
