!! Write a paragraph summarizing each person's week:

* [[1uxb0x]]
** 1uxb0x
*** For once in a while, I have something for every work day, now to improve on that. I've been having a lot of of fun in magic, even with playing a different deck. I've done worst in my writing subjects...which isn't as surprising as you may think. I'm happy that AIR air-ived.
** j3d1h
*** This week seemed pretty chill for you, and I'm glad. You probably needed some sort of break. Your school is still improving, and I especially liked your writing on rainforests. Give your grammar a little work, and I think you'll be in great shape for writing! You've done a fantastic job building MUC, by the way. It's utterly broken.
** k0sh3k
*** You did more schoolwork this week, and I'm glad you got something written for almost all of your subjects! (Now you just need to get math in there, and write more and on the correct days!) Thank you for helping your dad with the installation projects - like the cat doors! I appreciate it. You seem to be doing a better job with your room this week, too, and your laundry. I'm glad you got new socks; you needed them.
** h0p3
*** [[1uxb0x]] was more on his own this week. He's not in the groove of school yet, but there's been work (wish there was proof, as usual, but I've interrupted him enough to know it was non-zero). He's been jovial at the cost of productivity. He helped me hang the chalkboard and install the catdoors (girls are happier, and so are the cats; good job). He's been whoopin' ass in [[MTG]] and even started mastering another deck. It's been fascinating to see him with [[AIR]] again, like watching him grow up before my eyes.
** AIR
*** I can't speak to growth or change in this week, but I am grateful for the help in finding where everything is. I really enjoyed playing Magic: The Gathering with you. It's fun to watch you and your sister gang up on me. Getting hugs from you was awesome. You have grown so much and I am so happy I get to spend time seeing you grow more as a person and to hang out with you.

* [[j3d1h]]
** 1uxb0x
*** After all this is over, and we start walking outside again, can we talk to eachother during at least one of them? Thanks. I've not gotten to talk to you much. Thank you for helping me with my computer. Thank you for making sure to do the floors.
** j3d1h
*** I wasn't too stressed this week, and taking my pills does seem to help with static. (We already knew that, I'm just not taking them frequently enough.) Art did not go well, and unfortunately I still have a few trades to get through. I also need to work more on anatomy (Valentyme's suggestion). School went very well! I'm liking my creative writing more than before, probably because I'm //doing// the exercises, though I've had to skip a few that I just couldn't focus on. Social Studies was surprisingly easy, I just need to start writing down the highlights.
** k0sh3k
*** You did a lot more schoolwork this week - I'm very glad! Your writing on the Phoenicians, Greeks, and Cretans was great. Your science was really good, too, and I like your creative writing work (although I think there ought to be more of it, as well as civics). Next week, I hope to see math and literature in there, too!  I'm always glad you're up and getting started on time each morning! I like that you pick up random interesting facts and relay them to us; I'll say again that you can and should use part of your school time to check out CuriosityStream videos! (https://arstechnica.com/science/2009/02/yes-virgina-there-is-a-magenta/ -btw!)
**** Maybe we should spend a semester doing information literacy and fact-finding? That would be a cool elective!
** h0p3
*** [[j3d1h]] has a noticeable improvement in her schoolwork this week (without my intervention). Good job! [[2021/01/26 -- Social Studies]] is exceptionally strong work, and I hope to see at least that every day (turn it up to 11, please). She destroyed her father in [[MTG]]. Your KaTeX usage is leet (keep going, make it native to you; erryone likes pretty papers). She's been swearing like a sailor. I pick out clothes she likes (though she hates to admit it). We've had our continued friction, but her attitude has improved some (as have her social inferences). She continues to resist being rational with her father in some places with almost all her might; it's impressive. She was more honest this week. We've had good moments each day, and that has been a blessing. Her (and her butterfly knife skills) are edgy and beautiful.
** AIR
*** You have been very helpful. Your win in the second game of magic was on fleek, I would like to play again with you and 1uxb0x. You have a great sense of humor and are quick witted. I like when you boop me on the nose. I am grateful that I will be able to come to you with my future computer questions.

* [[k0sh3k]]
** 1uxb0x
*** Thank you for pushing me to work on my handwriting. If I remember your average joe's carbon footprint, combined with all other average joe's footprints, is about 30% of all carbon made, and 50 or 60% is just from companies. People taking to long to do a simple task? Yeah, I've heard of something similar...
** j3d1h
*** Pretty funny that no-one in the management class team wants to manage the team. Maybe they're //all// "natural leader" types, and thus are just as tired of this as you? And, of course, there's always that one person in the group project (or that one //rest of the group//, depenind on who you pick). Sleep deprivation is definitely the curse. Burlington was nice, we should go more often.
** k0sh3k
*** I ran two experiments and both failed pretty miserably. Cutting back caffeine didn't help me sleep; stopping my anxiety meds made me irritable all week. I guess I'll still drink less caffeine, just because I ought to be drinking more water, anyway, but I'm going back on my anxiety meds, I guess. /sigh This week was pretty stressful, but productive, at work. I was pretty exhausted when I got home most days, and crashed entirely on a couple days. I did get in some good reading and some terrible TV, though.
** h0p3
*** [[k0sh3k]]'s recognized the value of her anxiety meds, and she's been thoughtful about experimenting. She's provided significant //Skintime// and naps in laps to her honeybuns. Work has been intense, particularly because her management class has been a ridiculous amount of busy work (made naked by covid's effects, many of the managers in her current program don't actually do anything for a living beyond credentialing and taking credit for work they didn't do). She's watched plenty of garbage, and she's gotten some real sleep this week (not that it was perfect). It's been delightful making coffee with her and grabbing her ass in the mornings. Your Commonplace Book is a beacon in the desert and a fine example for the rest of us (we need to get your public wiki side fixed).
** AIR
*** Thank you for picking me up at the airport, I appreciate the conversation in the car ride home and really stressing the point of me taking some time to rest and get myself back together. I am excited and relieved to be here with you.

* [[h0p3]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I enjoyed putting up the cat doors with you. You're definitely socializing with people more. I've enjoyed playing MTG with you, even with the new deck. It was kind of you to set up a room for AIR.
** j3d1h
*** All your friends are apparently insane. I'm glad you're still getting to talk to Sphygmus, if not as much as you'd like. That's a good line - "A fanatic is one who can't change his mind and won't change the subject". It's not universal, of course, but it's very accurate! I'm glad that 1uxb0x is catching on to Affinity, but it's still my deck forever. You shouldn't be allowed to talk to dead philosophers for so, so many reasons.
** k0sh3k
*** This week was crazy for me; thank you for being my double-blind on my experiments. You did a lot of work this week, both physically (with the cat doors and curtains and getting everything set up) and mentally (just thinking, as always), but also, very thoughtfully, with taking care of me. I'm glad you keep a weather eye on my mental/emotional/physical well-being. Your sleep schedule seems to have swung around again, so that you're up in the mornings more.
** h0p3
*** [[h0p3]] had a fascinating week, again. It was surprisingly [[hope]]ful, packed with more socializing than anticipated. Things have seemed brighter, =). He's been [[/b/]]ish, horny, busy, too high one day, and really glad to see his brother. Progress has been made in the house, his writing has slowed down and been more haphazard, and folks seem to be doing alright (so he's doing alright). [[MTG]] has been a solid way to get in more facetime with his offspring, but overall he's been more schizoid (despite having socialized online a decent amount).
** AIR
*** You have been so helpful to me, thank you for everything. I have missed your hugs (you give great hugs). Thank you for driving me everywhere to pick up the things I need. I appreciate you setting up my room for me and helping me to find stable footing. I am looking forward to living here.

* [[AIR]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I've enjoyed playing MTG with you. I'm happy we've been able to help you. I've liked talking to you. If you want anymore help with your room, I'd be happy to help.
** j3d1h
*** I'm so glad you got here safely! It's great to see you again - I hope this is a good chance for you to take a break and get everything sorted. I'm also happy your room got put together pretty quickly (minus the insulation bit). It's been super fun playing M:TG with you! Your laughter has been super infectious, and it makes the house that much nicer.
** k0sh3k
*** I liked picking you up and bringing you home; it was a fun drive. I'm glad you made it! It's been fun having you around these last few days. Thank you for talking to me about book tropes and terrible TV. Settling in and playing with the kiddos has occupied most of you time here, so far, and I figure you'll need some more time to just do those things - take all the time you need!
** h0p3
*** [[AIR]] made the journey up to CT, and he's been making it home. He's going with the flow and designing his room. He's got the basic necessities, and is going to get some chill time in. He's been in a good mood, not too overwhelmed (I would be in his shoes), and talking a lot with everyone. We've been catching up. He's got new clothes, and he's making his room warmer. It's been a week of major transitions for him. It's good to see that he's maintaining his friendships remotely (as one does in these quarantine times, but now because there is so much physical distance too). It's been a smooth landing; we've lived with each other for decades, and I appreciate the seemless weaving together again.
** AIR
*** The past week has been crazy. Moved to a new state and in with my family (it's so nice to be with them, I have missed them a lot). I have to keep telling myself to accept their love and kindness (exp taking a break to relax and enjoy the time here and get my head in order). It has been an emotional-coster for me this week. I am excited for the adventure here and the new chapter in my life to start. Trusting people does not come easily to me, and I know h0p3 and k0sh3k are aware of this, so it means a lot to me that they were there for me the whole time I was in the process of making this move and showing me that they are here to catch me and help me restart. I am honored to have family and my best friends be here for me.
