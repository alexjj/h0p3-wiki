; 2021.02.17 - CaptainObviousMC: I Don't Like You

Hello CaptainObviousMC,

I'm looking for you, human. I just want [[to talk|cancel culture is dead]], though shots will be {{Text Art: 𝕱𝕴𝕽𝕰🔥}}d. I've asked around with my fellow retards, and maybe I'll be able to get in touch with you.<<ref "a">> Regardless, I highly doubt you'll see my hospitable response to your existence. In case you do: `/bow`. You are why I struggle to put the gun down (in minecraft™, obv, cap'n), and I [[hope]] you'll find some irony in that.

<<<
I sometimes think the point of the comment your replying to is exactly to solicit your comment: your comment is correct that many conspiracy theories are silly, but the implication of your correction is that his advice is also wrong -- which I'm not sure it is. (Yes, I am aware that my comment is a conspiracy theory; however, I work in the field of shaping online opinion with bots and sockpuppets, so there is some real conspiracy there.
<<<

`/squint`. Okay. I'll believe you because even if you were lying, it would at least be sufficiently true. I'm oddly [[grateful]] to see self-aware wolves come out and say it. I think there is almost something resembling a redemptive and penitent act in your discussion. You are still lying to yourself and to us though.

The SCADA systems are a literal threat to national security because of how badly corporate America secured them. There is a real risk of hackers compromising control systems for cars (as they've demonstrated the ability to do with OnStar), and causing damage to people, harming infrastructure (with a semi-truck impact, for example), or just plain old clogging traffic and economic impacts.
<<< 

That's a fact. Keep spittin, homie. How could you be so brilliant and not fight against it? Egoistic garbage. There's still a chance to fight. Come on, turn around! 

<<<
There is a concern about the government using these technologies for a blackout during emergencies. Not so long ago, they implemented martial law in Boston in the wake of a terrorist attack, with an accompany curfew. 
<<<

Also a well-known fact. There are 'emergency' switches already in place for this, and not just in the US. All nation-states already work toward this. Myanmar, atm, is a fine example. Why aren't you fighting against it? We both know why.

<<<
You don't have to be crazy to think that these are a potentially dangerous technology, and that the benefits to the consumer don't really justify the risks. In fact, that we're only seeing them forced on marginalized people because it benefit the companies exploiting them should tell you something about the technology.
<<<

I think you know the other parts of why the marginalized are allowed to be targeted here. It's convenient that you've left that part out.

<<<
I can't name names for privacy reasons.

I'm willing to cross many lines here. I don't believe you deserve your [[privacy]].

The gist of what I do is teach computers to do sentiment analysis on social media posts that are of interest to clients, tag them based on their various properties (author, sentiments, keywords, etc), and add them to a giant graph of all social media posts we're interested in, who else has retweeted them or the link, who responded to them, etc. We use this to estimate exposure numbers and influence, and try to isolate the key people in a social graph which are causing an opinion to form. (Ideally, on the order of minutes or hours instead of days or weeks.)
<<<

Not all forms of sentiment analysis are immoral, but most uses in the wild are. Why aren't you hunting for ways to prevent this? We both know the odds are slim, but they aren't none.

<<<
Once we isolate key people, we look for people we know are in their upstream -- people that they read posts from, but who themselves are less influential. (This uses the same social media graph built before.) We then either start flame wars with bots to derail the conversations that are influencing influential people (think nonsense reddit posts about conspiracies that sound like Markov chains of nonsense other people have said), or else send off specific tasks for sockpuppets (changing this wording of an idea here; cause an ideological split there; etc).
<<<

I know I've been caught in such webs before (and probably still am), and I know it radically shapes even what I see indirectly. 

<<<
The goal is to keep opinions we don't want fragmented and from coalescing in to a single voice for long enough that the memes we do want can, at which points they've gotten a head start on going viral and tend to capture a larger-than-otherwise share of media attention.
(All of the stuff above is basically the "standard" for online PR (usually farmed out to an LLC with a generic name working for the marketing firm contracted by the big firm; deniability is a word frequently said), once you're above a certain size.)
Careful analysis of online communities (or reading the papers where they got caught) would tell you that various nations are using similar technologies against their citizens and other nations. It's not entirely about business that China is concerned with building a domestic social network, and DARPA runs extensive research programs on social graph analysis and influence, on behalf of the Pentagon.
<<<

I wouldn't call it immoral, but I certainly would call it amoral.
The simple truth is I sold out because I spent my years from youth to adulthood watching my country slowly have an expanding military presence actively directed against the citizens as a whole, continuously, coupled with people being completely unwilling to listen to anyone talk about the issues it was causing or to take seriously that the rise of machines -- both computers and robots -- was have an effect on society that was fundamentally changing how things operated. Sure it was more of the same, but the machines were making that 'more' a little bigger each time. They were all so smart and I was just being overly worried about the kinds of social graphs that Facebook built, you see.
So I just got tired and decided that because no one was interested in the solutions, I was at least going to make money on the problem and live a comfortable life until they either changed their minds or I died. The technology I work on is specifically things to exploit the lack of social focus in society -- picking one movie as the Summer Blockbuster over the other -- and less able to work on things like redefining what 'liberty' means. Even I consider those guys somewhat questionable.
If you're really upset, the solutions are straightforward, relatively inexpensive (~$10-100mil), it's just that people aren't upset enough that 10% of the country is even willing to pay $1 to towards the solution. Not really. They're comfortably immersed in Xboxes, McDonalds, and various creature comforts. They're okay that maybe I got paid $1 last month because they ate more McDonalds than Burger King, and that maybe it's because I tricked them in to it -- it just doesn't matter in their lives. Does the reason you picked McDonalds over Burger King need to be anything more than just you talked about one more recently than the other? Does it really matter?
So, let me ask you this: how many times in the last... let's say decade did you donate when one of your nerdy friends was really upset about some issue with technology you only half understood? and if you didn't help then, why are you so surprised he eventually got worn out of trying to fix things? and are you really upset that Burger King cares enough about your business that they've devoted a computer core somewhere just to analyzing what would convince you to buy a burger? or are you just surprised they can?
Note: None of the companies or products mentioned are companies I've worked for or with. They're simply recognizable brands that everyone accepts try to trick them with marketing, standing in for other brands.

>    the anonymity of the internet makes it impossible to know if I'm talking to someone or merely one of the heads of a hydra

Do you really believe this is so clear cut in real life?
How many of your friends that work for big corporations, and seem to oddly favor their industry on certain topics? Are they part of the hydra?
Do they become part of the hydra when the people organizing news shoes decided that those people are the ones we want to hear from, and the other ones aren't?
If there's one things that's obvious from the news: it's much easier to get a fake consensus on the opinion you want when you just shout it really loudly on behalf on people who genuinely believe that for whatever odd reason they happen to. People like you only see the genuine belief of the person talking on the show, and that they're not marketing. But a genuine person is on the news, so their view must be important! That you're exposed to that genuine belief on that show rather than a slightly different genuine belief had been carefully selected, and the talking heads are essentially both strawmen meant to frame the debate a certain way, and it doesn't matter which of them does a better job of explaining their silly position -- just that you accept the framing of the debate. (How could you not? BOTH sides are represented!)
I think you're being very naive if you think what I do is anything else than an amplification of the same old game, and not by as much as you seem to think. There was always false framing of debates to shift the ideological window, astroturfing, ideological wedges, etc etc. We just do it with computers now, so it's slightly cheaper.

Welcome to the future.
I suggest crowd sourcing hiring someone like me to write an app that you can pay $5/mo to run on Digital Ocean or Amazon and do online things of that nature for you.
Even if you ignore people like me, the future simply has too much input to not filter with machines -- or rather, if you don't, you'll always be behind people that do. Twitter, even ignoring any bots or other influence, is still a celebrity shouting match for who gets to have the dominant opinion in the blog cycle. (My job is just to nudge the results one way or the other, but it's still fundamentally a shouting match -- I'm just renting megaphones.)
To get a useful result of Twitter, what you want is a slice showing you the distribution of opinions (statistics, yay!) as well as showing you the 100 most unique which contain a particular keyword or something of that nature. Instead what people are often shown -- and what unfortunately becomes the basis of the news cycle -- is just the single (or say dozen) most popular posts... which are virtually useless, unless you just want to hear about if your favorite website is offline.
I think the real shame is that people have simply lagged to adapt to how powerful computers are, and don't run these kinds of software themselves. I also think that will change in 5-10 years, as Milenials grow up, and that once consumers are used to the idea that you really need a service working for you to filter out all the crap, a lot of what I do will be a useless technology.
P.S. If anyone is looking for those "If you just do one thing..." tips, I suggest only making important decisions by handwriting letters to friends, and mailing them by USPS. Yes, this takes time and is cumbersome. That's not accidental. The "easy" things often exploit short-circuit reasoning in your brain, which is more susceptible to trickery. Focusing on spending time producing a finished product, external to yourself, which is meant to convince another person and only making on exchange of ideas a week with the other party (3 days each way with mail delay), forces you to process the thoughts differently, and take less shortcuts because of the investment you're putting in.

Out of curiosity, how much would you actually pay for someone to do, not the PR part, but the data analysis and synthesis part? (Assuming you don't regard simply having computers read lots of things and synthesize down the data as evil.)
Partly, what I do is leveraging the fact that the corporation can see the world more clearly than you can, and leverage your short-sight range and blurry vision.
Obviously, individuals can't afford what I do -- either the servers or the technical staff. But thousands or tens of thousands could, for probably less than the individuals spend on coffee, or beer, or energy drinks a week (if not a day). In fact, having a news digest that scanned all of the news and computed a digest for you from it would be a relatively straight forward application and moderate out a lot of the PR, as competing groups would have infiltrated different sources (to varying extents). (There are similar other solutions to other problems.)

>    I still think your occupation is completely and irreparably deplorable, as you do engage in the widespread manipulation of thought and public opinion, effectively stifling the human condition and perverting the human experience

Here, the two threads of what I'm about to say converge: people don't care. They get really preachy about it, but when you look at how they act, from who they choose as social group leaders to politicians, what they actually want is paternal manipulation of their opinions from people they instinctively feel comfortable with and to not have to think too hard while enjoying creature comforts.
I think you're feeling mad about what I do, but it's really the answer to what people ask for with their dollars: being gently guided in to more and more creature comforts for less and less of their efforts, and ceding management control in exchange. Everything I do would be trivially defeated if people proactively took responsibility for themselves and engaged in self-management. Instead, they offload their thinking to the cloud, take easy, feel good soundbite opinions, and just sort of cavort around enjoying an easy life.
That is, I think people are genuinely happy with what I do and the arrangement we've come to in society, and simply pretend to be offended because they don't like the sight of human gluttony and they know it's the "right" social position to take.
So I guess the question is, your post is really preachy, but do you think most people would pay two lattes a month to change from mindless self-indulgence to thoughtful self-direction?
If not, why are you mad at me for giving them what they want?
I can prove that virtually everyone ends up feeling happier from hearing a feel good soundbite as a result of what I do, and goes about their life both feeling they've done something and happier. They weren't actually interested in doing something for real, they are leaving that up to someone else.
Someone like my employers.

>   You seem well-positioned to provide such a service as you speak of to filter DPR from feeds / web services, given the incentive / funding etc, but I feel as though any effort toward such a service would be met with overt hostility through many channels of those who do actually run DPR on major web content providers.

The current state of affairs is actually just a consequence of the fact that corporations are better at arranging capital than disparate groups of people, so they got together their money to build their stuff first. (The gap between the two is shrinking with things like Kickstarter.)

In a relatively short period of time, now that people are aware of sockpuppets (if not to the extent to which such technologies are used), someone will manage to prove that there's enough demand in the top 20% or whatever of people ("power users"?), and they'll get the funding together to build exactly that.

What's interesting is that the pushback is actually likely to push things back further than they've moved, to the point where there's actually a more informed (and active in the information market) middle class than there was in say... 1990, which are backed by aggregated machined running crowdfunded projects on data.

tl;dr: The problem was likely to solve itself eventually, so we figured we wouldn't really do that much damage and just took money on the problem until people got their shit together. People were dumber than expected. I'm sorry. But the times, they are a'changing.

Do you think everyone on the data team at Facebook is a sociopath?
I don't work at Facebook; however, what do you think promoted posts, the selection of posts to show in your timeline, etc are, if not exactly the same as what I do? Remember, not long ago, Facebook got caught experimenting on humans using their website, intentionally trying to make their users happy or sad with their Timeline post selection algorithm.
The banality of evil is that the vast majority of the team of people researching and developing this product are all perfectly normal people who go home to their loving families, have close relationships, etc etc, and simply don't view the people they're impacting as people, but instead, numbers. (This is similar to many other fields, and marketing in general.)
The frightening part of what I see happen is not that sociopaths run technology, but rather, that technology enables normal people to distance other people in to being just data values, and thus enabling them to take actions they otherwise wouldn't.
I think that there is an institutional problem with dehuamnizing and decontextualizing data in technoology.

You are an intelligent and knowledgeable human, Cap'n.<<ref "t">> Many of your arguments concerning morality that weren't rationalizations of your lifestyle held sufficient water, particularly your critical and [[deconstructive|Deconstruction Obligates Reconstruction]] responses (that's the easy part, as you know and as you'd see here if you did at all). You are self-aware enough to know what kind of sociopath you are (it's cute that you masquerade as a post-political apathetic content sponge), and I want to admire that level of honesty. There's actually some kind of integrity to it.<<ref "k">>

But, seriously, from the bottom of my heart: fuck you.

Sincerely, fuck you. I hope you kill yourself.
