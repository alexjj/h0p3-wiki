title: 2022.12.15 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Is is is.

Woke at 12:30. Meditation. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. A bit with [[T-Money]]. Completing the [[letter]] to [[Piotr M. Salomon]]. 

Mi amor was up. Hugs'n'bugs. She slept. Good. I tried to sleep again, but I phased in and out.

Breakfast with my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]]. Picked out 5 Craigslist options for her, and she wanted the links. I've offered to make the calls for her, but says she's up for it. 8D9.

[[MTG]] with my sympaticon and my son. My sympaticon is going to be the first among us to exercise the [[awe]]someness of complete transformational sideboarding between games (and opponents) by building two different decks meant to control her different opponents (who aren't going adaptive). Decided to [[TTTOTW]].

Constructive dialectics with my sympaticon. Planning for the immediate future and {[[dream]]}ing about a decade from now.

My offspring have decided they do not want any of their domain names anymore.<<ref "p">> My son finished //Freakonomics// and dove into secondary literature about the book (I won't be asking for an essay). Can't say my daughter used her time to be productive. I have no idea. Up to her. They also sat down to read the [[letter]]. Didn't have time to make it all the way through though as they had a lot to say.

Mi amor called. She is not feeling her second paper, at all. No interest. Now it is a grind. 

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. //Inform the Men!// Meditation.

[[Family Gathering]] was fun. Mi amor was showering, and my daughter said she was interested in watching something psychological. [[Sharp Objects]] will be forthcoming, and //No Country For Old Men// as well. We ended up on //Wilfred//. Good gawd that show is a riot, and I've only seen it once all the way through. It's a treat to see the details now. Those who have had their bubbles burst, insanity with their lives actually on the line, can appreciate this absurdity (and surely have much to criticize too), especially with a [[redpill]]ed lens concerning the selfishness of most people. We had Rum Ham Water Bean Soup, and it was good. It is difficult to prepare beans in a way that are texturally acceptable to my autistic retardations (though I will eat damn near anything that is safe to eat [and under many conditions, particularly in the sacrament of conversation, I will endanger myself too]), but this was well-done. //Mr. Robot//. I don't know what metaphor there is for recursively jumping sharks, but it do.

Sleep by 9?
