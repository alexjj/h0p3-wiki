title: 2022.03.29 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Simple

Tagback with [[DeathOfRobinhood]]. [[TTTOTW]]. I can see I need more time with [[Impassionata]]. Thinking about the moves they continue to make, especially concerning legibility.

Untenable hiccup with cabal.chat's appimage with opensnitch, as it unpacks into tmp and appears like a new binary each time. Can't build cabal.chat. =/. Project may be dying if git is a tell. Fuck. It's so hard to find p2p groupchat options, especially asynch. Also, opensnitch burns at least half a core the entire time on my machine. =/. Continued walking through the p2p graveyard, most for Windows. I suppose the real test is whether or not we can resurrect these networks from peers alone, those executables worth keeping, maybe. I have my radical doubts. 

A manic race of [[Music: Exploration]], hunting for [[gem]]s, coming up short. Stirfry leftovers + [[TTTOTW]]. Sleep again by 3, maybe?

Woke at 7:30. //Skintime// with my sympaticon and planning. [[DeathOfRobinhood]] was on and firing away. Catchup. Thankfully. [[TTTOTW]]. [[Morning Routine]]. Assignments. Massage. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Prepped dinner with my sympaticon. Millennial toast, pear, water.

[[1uxb0x]] and [[j3d1h]] came down (she drew until she was tired of being with us). The trio continued Normal Baal runs, and everyone hit 50, including Sugar and NeckRomancer. The group was not working smoothly today, but my characters are reaching critical mass where I can hard carry. Aurora, [[ASK]]'s sorc, is now Meteor, but may still eventually split Orb/Fire.<<ref "o">> Some gearing up today, including a +2 Summer wand I nabbed off a vendor, Undead Crown, Orphan's Call (sad, I know). We're in search for socketed gear still, as eventually, we'll be able to wear enormous amounts of MF (so we don't waste our time). Found a Culwen's for my [[1uxb0x]] right after the session, as I rushed A1NM in 10 minutes on Sugar. Sugar is a beast now with +3 skills (including that +1 sorc shield). It would take me 8 hours to begin Hell Mephisto runs, I think. But, again, it would ruin the experience for me to rush ahead and twink us out. My gogogogogo is to hit 80 and trade into god-tier (not possible for us*). Part of the problem is that we're going to hit places that should be done as solo MF runs to equip us, but I don't think anyone but me would be interested in doing that. We'll see. I think there's something to be said for a LAN party in which we individually rush for a while on our own. We're just now hitting what the grind feels like. My son isn't deep into the metagaming yet, but he is optimizing. 

Desert father reading. Still doesn't quite click. [[TTTOTW]]. Mi amor is staying late for work to run a job. Old ass tech she's forced into using.

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. We're both dog tired. She layed on me, both of us belly down. Talked about her day, then I fell asleep.

[[Family Gathering]] was delicious. Chicken and roasted veggies. Back to sleep, maybe 8:30?

<<footnotes "o" "Static is a one point wonder against Immune Fire+Cold, alongside a merc*. And, Orb + Mastery is probably the cheapest 40 points a sorc can spend to do Hell viable damage, cause that penetration is pretty insane. LR + Conviction could turn her into a goddess.">>
