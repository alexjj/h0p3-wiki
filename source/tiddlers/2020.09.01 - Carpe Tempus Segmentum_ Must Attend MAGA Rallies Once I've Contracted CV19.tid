title: 2020.09.01 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Must Attend MAGA Rallies Once I've Contracted CV19

* Woke at 1
** Omg, that was amazing. Best sleep since forever.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Dialectures
* Read+Write
* Cleaning
** More kitchen duty. Offspring felt it wasn't where it should be. I thought my final moves were enough, but after seeing what they picked out, I agree (I was very wrong). 
** My offspring are too likely to get lost in their heads while they do manual labor. I wish I knew how to convince them to turn up the optimization drive. I think there's a non-trivial chance that they'll have to work with their hands.
*** Even plenty of geniuses in history have simply worked the fields.
** Talked a lot about my jobs at McD's and as a janitor. I hope we can find a productive groove for them. 
* Read+Write+Walk+Talk
* The Walk
** Barefeet again, except one section with too many tiny sharp rocks.
** Thought about her day. It's still a madhouse, but it seems to be handlable.
*** Definitely missing her student workers. They might start back here soon.
*** She has been thanked a lot for her work. Good.
** We thought about [[Sphygmus]] and games.
** Her feet were getting sore. We need to make sure she wears non-dress shoes on her walk.  
** She agrees that [[chameleon]] is in a tough spot.
* Made dinner with offspring
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Tendies, tons of watermelon, salad, and even chips with salsa. I had a cold coffee too.
** Watched //Lovecraft Country//
*** My daughter asked a question, and it required us to pause (she seemed to regret asking because I had to wander). 
**** Pretty sure my daughter just wants me to stop interacting with her so much (at least toward the end of the night...earlier in the day seemed better). I'm not sure what's up.
* Read+Write
* AFireman Time!
* Read
* Attempted sleep around 4...Don't think I fell asleep until 7:30.
** FUCK
