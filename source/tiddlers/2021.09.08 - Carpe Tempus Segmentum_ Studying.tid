title: 2021.09.08 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Studying

Woke at 2:30. Wired and racing. Anxious enough that //Fireman Time// outright failed (despite my best efforts, ofc). I often find myself preparing for conversations. A libidinous sacrifice (past week has been lower than my usual), but I have no room to complain. [[TTTOTW]].

She's up, solid, a very busy day ahead but she doesn't know what's all on the docket (a good sign, in the case, imho). I'm hoping that taking classes will be strictly rejuvenating for her, back where she belongs. It's different from the MLIS too, as her fundamental vocation underneath her librarianship is what now gets to be retrained or at least recognized if not expressed. It opens doors, and these are the kind she relishes walking through (no matter how difficult). It is a blessing.

No idea what time I actually fell asleep. I'm back to not sleeping well, I take it. I am very [[lucky]] to be able to not sleep well and still have an amazing day. Back pain, also. Made it quite uncomfortable. I know what [[k0sh3k]] is going to say. (3...2...). I [[love]] you.

Woke at 2:30 again. Meditation. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. I am still reading through [[search_social]]'s accounts, bump into him often, almost argued on an [[Aether]] thread about 4chan (did I see him again recently?) about having met him there. I am exercising my right to remain silent still; the asymmetry is tremendous. He is a patient [[4eak]] like myself though, for which I am [[grateful]].

Chatted briefly with [[5c0ut]]. He's still hunting for different jobs. He had come down, but I wasn't able to host anyone at the time.

//The Walk// with my offspring. Smooth going. Vapelyfe. My daughter did not complete her mother's work, but she had enough to say. The definition of Biology from her book seemed poor to both of them. They wrestled, and they gave birth to a discussion of biology and psychology relationships too. Method was the second chapter. We spent a great deal of time flying through induction, yet again. Back to [[FO]] logic, understanding the [[infinigress]] of The Foundation problem, Mathematical induction (and more fundamental kinds of trust in proofs), Sir Hume and Saint Kant, [[phenomenology]] and [[faith]], Bayes, the problems of trying to model the scientific method, very broad and tacit concepts of science, etc. Her book was obviously not saying it well enough (most scientists really don't know the edges of this problem, and I'm no expert either). 

A new [[Close Encounter]], again. We met the person I've been waiting to meet for many months now. Elaine of The Farmhouse. She came to the edge of the property to ask us a question about the garbage run. I think she had been waiting to speak with us too.<<ref "a">> Devout, 75yo?, exceptionally careful with her symbols, a daily mass Catholic, clearly lived in this region her entire life (maybe only 3-4 moves). Immediately appreciated why we [[homeschool]]. Interesting to hear the words from my daughter's lips, that her mother is her current primary teacher, and I'm her secondary. My offspring are very slow in how they inject themselves into the conversation, and Elaine was quite aware of that. A widower of 16 years who has had her son's mother-in-law (also a widower) live with her for 20, until very recently. They split maybe, quite recently, and then the in-laws have taken the other in. She is alone and pays her son rent for an apartment inside The Farmhouse. She asked if we study God, and it would be rude to say: like no one you've ever met, but I said we studied often. Like any decent elder, she coughed up tailored wisdom to my daughter, eye-to-eye (and, of course, she was told to soak in every moment of our precious walks). I can see part of her knows we largely exist to serve the young and the unborn. Her body shook as she spoke with us, more than usual. She knew exactly where we were, and it was obvious in her advice and what she picked out as being [[salient]] about herself for us. A lifetime with her 5 boys flashed before us without spoken words. I think it was too much for her. Refused dinner with us. Of course, we discussed the conversation.

Met the Asian couple we've passed maybe 4 times. Sonum is her name. They flew from NY after 9/11 and were very quick to tell me it is a safe neighborhood. Did not want to speak, I think. Not an obvious curve though. I wonder if and what anti-Asian sentiment they've been  experiencing. In any case, I can appreciate why one runs from the desert madman, and, of course, most have better things to do with their time. My son completed both mathematics and permaculture studies today. My daughter is just as relentless as I am in interrogation sometimes. Spirals of topics, and a continued discussion of carcinisation in so many surprising things. Pretty sure it irks a few in our neighborhood that my offspring are encouraged to say "fuck" where appropriate (quite often in our conversations).

Worked downstairs. Finally convinced someone to install Photoshop (can't be done without it). Son has to repair the Windows machine (broken boot, for no reason, and he's got a set of notes about fixing it [that manboy knows me, lol]) and he's got a sync up. Gonna have to comb it for her.

She's home. //Skintime//. Toast. PT is an exercise session, and she really, really fucking hates exercise.<<ref "w">> PT Becky asked my wife if she had told me what Becky had said about the hicky. Why, but, of course, Hicky Becky, :P - I have offered suggestions about what your sessions should be about (I beg for every detail when another person even looks at my wife, and to touch her, oh my god, these are {[[dreams]]} come true for me, `/shiver`). The response was, "he said he wanted to write 'hi becky' on my neck in hickies." All agreed this would be impressive. I think I know what I need to work on (I've only made simple shapes before). My wife is funny at work. Business snark and puns, always good for them (so jelly). Also, a bruise on her arm from physical error at work (I can't see it, but she can feel it). She needs alone time, imho. Just vegg. [[TTTOTW]].

[[Family Gathering]]. Offspring made fish, tots, salad, and I had water (they had high fructose treats too). It was good (though my daughter seemed not hungry today, like the two take turns). //House// + //Skintime//. I eventually let go of her. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Checked kitchen for them, no even close. One day. Put her bed. She's studied enough. Hugs'n'bugs gnite. [[TTTOTW]] + LEC Playoffs. Fireman Time! Sleep by 11.
