Stranger: no it‚Äôs fine

Stranger: lol

Stranger: how old are you?

Stranger: im 11

You: I'm wondering if English, as it is used (not defined by some ivory tower) isn't transitioning away from many kinds of grammar.

You: I am 35, my friend.

Stranger: ohhhh

You: I'm ancient.

Stranger: lol

You: I'm from what you might call the 1900's.

Stranger: i am 5‚Äô1‚Äô

You: I'm sure Omegle is a fascinating place to be at your age. I would have found it quite interesting, if it existed at the time.

You: God damn!

You: That is tall. You are gonna be giant.

Stranger: lol

Stranger: thanks

Stranger: bye

Cool, cool, cool. `/salute`.

Stranger: Heyo

You: Heyas!

Stranger: Hii

You: You might be the first not to ask my gender.

You: Seems like the standard open on this site.

Stranger: üòÇ

You: What makes you so different?!?!

You: #notlikealltheotheromeglers

Stranger: What makes you so different huh?

You: Oh, more retardation than you likely would think possible.

You: https://philosopher.life/

You: That's me.

You: At your service.

Stranger: Die

You: Lol.

You: One day, it will happen.

You: I'm betting in 15 years or so.,

Stranger: Why you so fast tho

You: Oh, I spend lots of time on my computer. I talk with a lot of people.

You: Just practice.

You: How do you hope to die?

Stranger: Ohhh I thought I‚Äôd only get people on phone

Stranger: Bc I‚Äôm on phoje

Stranger: I didn‚Äôt mean it lol

You: Oh, I'm on [[monster-16]], https://philosopher.life/#monster-16.

Stranger: I thought you were a bit

Stranger: Bot*

You: Oh, lol.

You: Yeah, not the first person to worry about that.

Stranger: What are you doing on here?

You: I've had some people think all ~45MB of plaintext was generated by machine learning, GPT-3, or something like it.

You: Oh, I'm trying to understand [[Humanity]].

You: Looking for diamonds in the rough. Sifting.

You: How about you?

You: Mix of horny and bored?

Stranger: Well I‚Äôm bored

You: What brightens your day?

Stranger: Even tho I‚Äôm with like 10 people

You: Damn.

Stranger: Being with someone who makes me hapoy

You: Is it lonely in there?

Stranger: Nah

You: K, good.

Stranger: People like me haha

You: Being with people often makes me happy. It depends.

Stranger: Same

You: That's a gift, no doubt.

Stranger: Yeah I think that‚Äôs a lot

You: I think some really [[like]] me (even [[love]]), but most don't.

Stranger: No one hates me so I‚Äôm lucky

Stranger: No one I can think if

Stranger: Of*

You: None that hate you in particular. There's definitely people who hate classes or categories that you belong to.

You: That might be different in some crucial way.

You: What do you like to do with people?

Stranger: Like you mean me in school?

Stranger: Hangout

You: I mean that your ethnicity, your gender, your sexual orientation, your wealth, your various kinds of status, maybe even the way you have your haircut...there's haters for all kinds of these things.

You: But, they aren't singling you out.

Stranger: That‚Äôs facts

You: Tru

You: I'm a fan of facts, but also imagination. What kind of [[art]] do you like?

Stranger: I‚Äôm a happy person so people like that

You: It's very useful to walk around as a happy person. People are attracted to positivity.

Stranger: Yeis

Stranger: You have a phone number?

You: I do.

You: But, I am best reached over Tox or Session.

You: https://philosopher.life/#Contact%20h0p3

Stranger: Snap?

Stranger: What is that site?

You: I'm ultra, ultra picky (for reasons I am willing to explain, if you want) about the tools I use.

You: That is a site. It's mine.

You: It's like a journal that I write in, and more. It's huge.

You: The people who get to know me do so with that ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±.

You: (not great on a phone, but solid on a desktop or laptop)

Stranger: Should message me

You: I hear ya. I would like that.

Stranger: My phone number

You: Nope. don't tell me that.

You: I'm sorry if that sounds mean.

You: I don't intend it to be.

You: This is my Session key: 05c17f4a9286f13dc5e57cc996b8f9b76a0767b0edab8d9ff425dbb34afd063a48

You: https://getsession.org/

You: Works on your phone.

You: It's end-to-end encrypted, and you can maintain some anonymity with it too.

You: We can stay in touch that way, and you don't have to reveal your information to me (or anyone).

You: I know SMS is more convenient.

You: But, safety matters, my friend.

Stranger: Yeis

You: It's similar to Omegle, but you don't have to trust any middlemen (not sure how Omegle is designed, but they are able to track at least parts of our conversation, if not the entire thing).

You: I'm a dork, btw. Huge geek.

Stranger: Haha that‚Äôs dope

Stranger: I‚Äôm like a clout guy I suppose

You: What's a clout guy do?

Stranger: Just sit and get everything üòÇ

You: I can see how it takes some clout to accomplish that.

Stranger: Do you know what it means too ‚Äútrap‚Äù?

You: I know a couple different meanings for that term.

You: What do you have in mind?

Stranger: I just sell too everyone so I make good money and everyone loves me so it‚Äôs dope

You: I've thought about sellin' before.

You: Used to grow shrooms. Make my cannabutter. DMT.

You: https://philosopher.life/#Recipe%3A%20Cannabutter

Stranger: Should only do it too make money too do something else in life

You: Yeah.

You: Don't stay in that game long.

Stranger: I‚Äôm starting my own clothing brand so that‚Äôs I‚Äôm actually gonna do something good

You: Fast money, but high risk.

Stranger: Yeis

You: You do any the design work? Sketches? Construction?

You: (I'm a fan of a show called //Project Runway//; taught me a lot about life and fashion)

Stranger: I don‚Äôt just started like 3 days ago but I have everything pretty much and I got money

You: What are you hoping to make?

Stranger: Get*

Stranger: Sweatshirts

You: Going for patterns, or logos, or what will make them stand out?

Stranger: Do you snap Snapchat?

Stranger: A custom one it‚Äôs dope

Stranger: Made it are self

You: I do not. I [[aim]] to use tools I consider safe, decentralized, and designed to improve the material conditions of the working class.

You: I want to own my data. Snapchat doesn't seek that.

You: I'd like to see it eventually.

Stranger: I see

You: You tried Delta-8 out? https://philosopher.life/#Product%20Review%3A%20%CE%94%E2%81%B8

Stranger: Delta 9 smacks

You: Yeah, it do.

You: Expensive by comparison though.

Stranger: What do you do for a living?

You: Oh, I try to take over the world. XD. I read and write. I [[homeschool]] my offspring. I try to be useful to [[others]]. I'm hunting for solutions to some hard problems, primarily capitalism.

You: I'm a full-blown retard, my friend.

Stranger: Nah your a new start

You: Erryday is a new one.

Stranger: Should message me

Stranger: I‚Äôll be famous one day

Stranger: I‚Äôve gotta 3.3 mil views on tiktok before

Stranger: And I always go viral

You: I doubt I will be.

You: I had a video about me recently, have 250k views.

Stranger: Nah but I can support your site

Stranger: Dope

You: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDnd7_lSM3M

Stranger: ?

You: That's the video that speaks of my site. It's nothing, don't worry about it. He's as foolish as I am.

You: You don't have to support my site, btw. I actually work to speak with individuals as much as I can. Less of a crowd.

You: I'd like to see one of your tiktoks, if that doesn't reveal too much.

You: I keep some funny ones in my [[Link Log]]s, https://philosopher.life/#:[search[tiktok.com]tag[Link%20Log]]

Stranger: It‚Äôs just memes

You: maymays are dope

Stranger: My tiktok is miltongill101

You: Noice.

Stranger: üôÇ

You: Watching the 3mill [[vidya]] now.

You: lmao

You: It's perfeck

Stranger: üòÇüòÇ

Stranger: Yeis

Stranger: What‚Äôs the code too the app

You: That is my public key. I can hand that to people in the open. I have a private key that sits on my device (no one but me knows it). When you make an account, you'll also automatically have a pub/priv key pair generated. Basically, there's a handshake our clients can make together to demonstrate that we are the owners of the private keys that correspond to the public keys. That makes it so no one can impersonate me, and, it also allows us to generate a symmetric key for the session (fast, cheap encryption that works well) so that our conversation will be [[private]].

You: It does some other things on that application, I believe, as it is onion routed (kinda like The Tor Browser).

Stranger: I got the app it says I need a code too join the conversation

You: 05c17f4a9286f13dc5e57cc996b8f9b76a0767b0edab8d9ff425dbb34afd063a48

You: Should be able to add me with that.

Stranger: It doesn‚Äôt work

You: If you want, you can give me your key, and I'll add you.

Stranger: 056e2e89f6cf6751baf0d51a1dd7e10d936edc3f44035d1ff7fc51faed3236ae2d

You: Added, said "Hello!"

You: It worked. =)

You: We're good. I'm going to switch to Session, if that's alright.

Technical error: Server was unreachable for too long and your connection was lost. Sorry. :( Omegle understands if you hate it now, but Omegle still loves you.

"""
Hello!
Hey
Want to switch to this?
From Omegle?
Yup. I'm h0p3.
Lookin more up on the web. You able to land a flip still?
on a trampoline yeah
Not on ground anymore
Well, Omegle gave me an interesting error anyway*.
Trampoline is safer anyhow. 
Not as cooooool
Yeah I left it
Tru
You do parkour or anything like that?
Yeis
How old are you?
Don‚Äôt lie
I'm ancient. 35. 
It's right on the site. Born in 1985.
You can always lie
I work to be an extremely honest person. 
Yeah for what reason tho
It's true. I could be lying.
Like why talk to me
I understand being honest
Oh, because I think talking to be people is important, part of being a flourishing human, because I think I can be useful to others. 
That‚Äôs the best and communicating
Interesting
Why are you talking to me?
(lots of good reasons seem plausible to me)
Seems like you could help me but idk
What you do
(Btw, I do check this account every day...sometimes I don't respond instantly, but I am quite consistent). 
Alright
I help people think about what matters most in their contexts.
It's my vocation.
What‚Äôs that supposed too mean
A vocation isn't just a job. It's something you'd do even if you didn't get paid for it. It's something you'd do even if you were persecuted for it. You do it because it's a calling, but it's what you know you should do with your life. It's crucial to the meaning of my life that I engage in this practice.
[[Find The Others]], 
Werid
Truly
What do I need help with
Everyone needs [[help]], me included. We can't live life all on our own.
Yeis
There's too much to learn, so we rely upon others to help us pick out what is [[salient]], what matters. We have to trust our friends and experts to help us understand more than could be learned in a lifetime. I'm someone who can help in some odd places.
I have many people who care a lot
That is [[awe]]some. You might not need as much help as most people.
But, I bet there are still places where I'd be useful. 
I only really need help by someone doing all the work for me tbh
Take for instance introducing you to P2P E2EE messaging. Trying to understand what this tool is, in comparison to Omegle or Snapchat, might serve you well in the long-run. 
lmao
Yeah, I hear that.
That's make life easier.
But, there's a manner in which not doing it yourself will be like shooting yourself in the foot. You won't have earned it. You won't have really learned from the experience. It won't be yours, and you'll know it.
Having someone do all the work for you likely wouldn't be helping you or them.
I think often we rely upon other people to help us figure out what it is that we need to work on as individuals. They give clues, guidance, and sometimes resources beyond that. 
We're often wrong about what it is that we should be doing (though it may feel like we ought to pursue one thing, maybe it's not the fitting goal). 
My vocation is the pursuit of wisdom. I certainly can't do it alone.
Yeis
What do you like to read, Milton?
You got the aspirations, dreams, right? Gotta research, take notes, practice. I bet there's lots to study. 
It's okay if you gotta think about it. Take your time. To some extent, I'm methodical and slow in how I speak with people. It's a good thing we have that opportunity.
My armpits itch realllllly bad my bad I got distracted
Its some bullshit
I don‚Äôt read
I should tho
It's true. Hard to succeed at almost anything that's challenging without it. 
If you need a book, btw, let me know.
I'll do my best to find it for ya. 
Can send it right over the application too.
Yeah
I do a lot of reading online too. Forums often have crucial information. 
I bet there's a lot of subreddits devoted to making your clothing brand. You could learn about all that goes into it.
It would be important to consider the risks of it. I bet the success rate is extremely low, even for people who have everything they need. Making money in clothing is no simple task.
I could imagine there's tons of software to practice with too. Designers have lots of tools worth learning.
Yeis
Yeis
Btw, "Yeis" is fascinating. You don't happen to be from Newfoundland?
What‚Äôs fascinating?
Your use of the word "Yeis." I'm not used to seeing it.
Just a curiosity for an autist like me.
Not sure I like too use it
I used too day alright all the time
Say*
Yeah, I think we all have particular words and phrases that come and go with us. 
For sure
I still say "homie" these decades later. 
Dope haha
That's another one, lol. 
Yeis

...

How are you
I'm hanging in there. Just got up.
Gonna listen to //Foundation// with my offspring here soon enough.
How about you?
I‚Äôm good I suppose haha
Whatchu workin on today?
I‚Äôm doing drivers Ed now I have too drive for 1 hour 30 mins
Sounds like fun. Soak up everything you can.
You have a vehicle yet? You got any plans once you drive on your own?
I don‚Äôt yet and not really it‚Äôll just be useful
Yeah, definitely useful. Where I live, lacking a vehicle is profoundly limiting. People without that mobility are stuck, unable to find jobs, accomplish tasks price-efficiently (or at all in some cases), and become dependent upon those who can offer them rides.
