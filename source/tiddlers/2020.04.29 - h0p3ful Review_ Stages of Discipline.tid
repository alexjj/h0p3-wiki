*[[Notage Ti.17]]
** [[CDR]] and this are disappointing to me. You know better. You have a lot on your plate though. We can't be perfect everywhere (or anywhere really, in most senses, lol). 
*** One of our goals is to build up a load of process threads that you can manage each day. This will be safer and more disciplined in time (as your wiki demonstrates over the past three years).  
**** I'm particularly bad at it. So, I obviously don't have a lot of room to talk.
*[[Embodied Cognition]]
** `/high-5` - You are doing it, son. Can't wait to hear you deliver it. I hope to press you hard in wrestling now.
*[[2020.04.28 - h0p3ful Review: <3]]
** I like your stages of writing. We're eventually going to generate an explicit workflow for you that fits. 
*** I like that you take staging so seriously. May you be disciplined in all such processes.
*[[The Lightning Thief: 8, draft 1]]
** Outstanding, sir. You are kicking ass here. 
*** You should not predict this much success from your labor even most times (gonna be tons of failures before you land a success most of the time), but it's so delicious when you can make leaps like this. 
*** Don't stop pushing. Push, push, push! Squeeze everything for what it's worth.
**** Your teacher can take you from zero to hero here. You must proactively seek out your teacher's feedback. 
***** I would take notes as she talked to you about your papers. Talk about each of her points with her. Isolate the problems and practice solving them (make it so she knows you are listening). You still have tons of errors (including some of omission) in here, but they are all something you can defeat in time with high regularity. You've got the //good// kind of problems here. 
** God damn, son! I adore your work. Look at that effort! 
** I [[hope]] this is something you do for the rest of your life, even when no one is looking. Do it for you, homie. 
*** You can fuck up on my [[CDR]]s if you are going to deliver effort elsewhere. Thank you.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** Was [[Family 30th April 2017]] the possible prototype of your current practice of taking the notes for [[Family Log]]?
** You should consider adding to (and pruning) your [[Jokes.]] section. 
*** I would enshrine the original (or stages, since it's often not a gradualist evolution in here). Your humble beginnings make it epic, sir.
**** Hard to know what scraps of [[Relic]]s should be left in place too. I'm not sure what I'm doing on this front either. You have a lot of room to play with the story.
** [[2019.04.29 â€“ Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Early kitchen]] rude awakening, now it's two hours earlier, and you do it often enough, lol. =)
