title: 2022.02.28 - Variety Creepy: Escaping The Shallows

Dear Variety Creepy,

This is turning out to be longer than I thought it would be. <3. It is officially a [[letter]] rather than a [[note]]. I have no idea how to draw the line well. =D. In fact, there are some moves in this [[letter]] that matter more than I know how to explain. I appreciate the opportunity to think about it and commit so much to it. Thank you.

> Hey h0p3, I'm done with the majority of my tests. 3 more to go but you know what? Fuck it. I don't care.

I'm honored that you are //making// time for me. I know how expensive that is. Thank you. I love you.

I've a few [[Root Users]] who feel the pain in your words, sir. You are justified in distrusting many of the people you distrust, and we are still worried you don't have enough people to hug you. This is not your fault, and perhaps there's little we can do about it right now. Maybe biding our time is the best option. You appear to be isolating yourself even further (not just shrinking the circles you live in), and some are worried that I am your remaining tether (or perhaps a new connection*). I [[hope]] that I serve as at least a transition point (if not more*), a root for a vine upon which you swing deeper into the jungle of people who will understand you or with whom you will find belonging (which, sadly, does not necessarily mean mutual understanding or even reciprocity).

I want to remind you, again, that I am in [[Reply Mode]]. I've become less and less likely to carry<<ref "c">> conversations for (more than with) anyone (though I'm historically, as the record shows, a reliable, extra-mile ~~H~~ACKer [some might even say dogmackically so], even with [[anon]]s<<ref "w">>). And, you may not always find my words interesting (or interesting in the fitting way) to you.<<ref "k0">> That's okay too. I hope you will find even more reasons to speak with me beyond that you curiously find what I have to say interesting (I say that as someone who works hard to be interesting in some contexts).

> Thanks a lot! Yes, you have written a lot this time. I guess it would take a lot of typing for me too! Haha. But hey, I'm looking forward to it too!

Good. And, you know what? You might never answer my questions to either of our preferences (I'm still workin' on them myself). You do your best, sir. I'm looking forward to it as well. I'm hoping that you will see some value in slower, lengthier, and more committal writing in our [[hyperconversation]] as a foundation for our instant messaging (and, more, actually). 

> I don't know what you're talking about. Your English is flawless. You don't speak gibberish. 

Oh, it isn't flawless (and, hell, you know that!). That's kind of you to say though. I'll agree I work to make myself plain with you, particularly on the face of things, but the rest of my words to you and everyone in this ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî± are often quite unclear (not for a lack of trying to make it perspicuous). I embrace the schizophrenia of contemporary English (a big tent, imho). Poorly and most retardedly, I'm often overloading my words, knowing how different people will (or might*) read them. There's some show instead of tell in here too. A close reading (which, in many respects, I'm not qualified to do) of what I've expressed to you (and with you), often in [[link]]s and the broader shape of things, should likely result in a much harsher judgment. I do take it as a compliment that you don't find my gibberish to be gibberish though. Thank you.

> I want to thank you for giving me a chance every single time I have stopped texting you and then started once again. I'm sometimes a big douchebag. No wonder I don't have many people around me, lol.

You are fine, sir. You are going through some shit. You're sortin' out what's what and figuring out who you are and want to be. And, lord knows, I'm not as effective as I [[hope]] to be at either those tasks or communicating. You take your time, sir. Thank you for being willing to come back to the table again and again to speak with me (I know it can be quite expensive).

> I am ready to try any other means of contacting you. I'm a bigger noob than you are, pal. I hope I can do something about privacy issues. Most of them are unavoidable because I need them. I need Instagram for college. I need YouTube because, come on. Who doesn't use YouTube? The list kind of goes on.

You've [[recent]]ly deleted some of the apps (though [[Reddit]] quickly came back within hours, lol). I don't see why you //need// Instagram for college.<<ref "d">> I have a hard time believing you'll find relevant [[PSM]]s there, but perhaps it's the only bridge available in some cases. There are varying ways to improve one's [[privacy]] and [[anonymity]] even on Youtube. I can't say the effort is worth it, and, unfortunately, some of the moves may risk your Google account(s) (quite an ugly problem). Aside, I think you might be surprised by how little I use Youtube proportionately (though, in absolute amounts, still a considerable amount). How do you use Youtube? 

> Whoa, that means a lot. And for you to say that, it takes even more. I'm really honored to hear this. Kinda feeling like an imposter too in some odd way. Thanks a lot.

We gotta start somewhere, and we're on our way, brother. May it be a journey [[irwartfrr]]. `/cheers`.

> I would totally love to answer them all.

I [[hope]] you will [[aim]] to do so in your TW. You've got a lot of out-of-order fragments and contradictions to handle (as do we all!) in your story-telling. I have to warn you that many people reach this place with me, and then the conversation falls off. I will still be here, and it's okay if you fall off. It's part of my job to be personal + thorough ([[WINTCIS]]) and to accept that others will fail here just as clearly as I do.<<ref "f">> We will need [[silence]] sometimes, and I'll sit with you during those as well. 

> Happy anniversary to you too, dude. We've had a great year.

Hopefully in 3ish years, we'll be able to meet offline. I [[hope]] you won't mind how messy my room is. It's a haunted basement of degeneracy. 

> I haven't come out to anyone. Family and brother included. Only 5-6 friends of mine know that I'm ace, that's it.

I can imagine it's possible your parental units may not be willing to carefully reason about it with you. I don't know if they ever will,<<ref "g">> and I also know you're trying to avoid even considering what they think and feel here. I hope your brother will understand in time.<<ref "an">> I assume this will only get easier as your new relationships develop. 

> Well, I definitely have interacted a lot more people in the past year than in the year before. All thanks to college. I have found a couple of them, but I don't think it's worth starting a friendship with them. I'm kind of scared. But I still feel lonely most of the time. For the past four days, I want to cry for no reason and let all the emotions out. I best I could get is moist eyes when I was going on a Dragon Ball video. Sucks, sometimes. I wish I could.

I'm not sure how to respond to this well enough. I think that paragraph requires a ton of examination. 

I'm glad to hear you are incrementing how many people you speak with. I hope you continue to widen the pool of candidates for friends and ultimately the family you choose. I ask you to be fair in how you do so. May even the poorest person you meet be among the first you try to befriend. 

I believe you will have to sift through far more people than most. It's not just your well-earned trust issues, your social anxieties, deep imbalances in your experience and knowledge (much higher variance here than most too), rare background and privilege (and lack thereof*): you actually give a shit, and that's so precious and expensive. I'm going to continue to say: don't give up. It would be easy to take your anecdata and claim it's not going to happen. 

How do you know when it's worth starting a friendship with someone? And, holy shit, I totally understand what it's like being scared of failures here.<<ref "mem">> And, yet, putting yourself out there, taking that risk again and again with an open heart, it's the only way out. 

I'm glad that you consume media that lets you cry. Keep going and listening to the stories of [[others]]. It's expensive allowing ourselves to feel.<<ref "fe">> What are some other stories (and where in them?) that moved you as strongly (even if it you didn't have tears for it)?

My [[Root User]], Sir [[DeathOfRobinhood]], a man I cannot even begin to explain to you (though I have tried), gave me really good advice which seems to work for plenty of people I've encountered: dance. Take that [[music]] that owns you, and dance to it (we both spend a ton of time in our rooms, so it's easy enough to do it [[private]]ly). 

Lastly, I think it's an important time to point out how much I respect that you've chosen not to develop an allergy to sincerity. It would be so easy to do in your shoes, and you've refused to accept that bullshit.

>Though it is not conceptually the case, empirically and currently, do you think the ace community has a higher-than-average rate of self-absorption or people who are less interested in commitment to relationships?

> I haven't observed that.

Keep your eyes peeled for me. My daughter has been wrestling with some of these questions too.

> I'm making progress. The last time I wrote was February 9th. I wanted to write on Valentine's Day, but I couldn't because I had a test the next day.

It's difficult to set aside time to do it. If you really think the people around you cannot be trusted, then I think you should be documenting to guarantee you at least see through gaslighting attempts (and have a record to enable you to pick it out for others who might need evidence). That might not be necessary for you given how intelligent you are, and I don't take your parental units to be so dangerous to you (as they likely see you as an extension of their success). Long-term, it may be the only record that you do trust in some cases.

Hand-written diaries are easier to snoop upon than a properly encrypted file in many cases.

> No. I'm not. I don't the trust the internet well enough and I think it could backfire in some weird way.

I've addressed this directly with you (and many times elsewhere), but you don't have to trust the internet much or at all in this case (there's some odd technicalities to worry about, I suppose). I think it's easier to trust a machine I've locked down (especially with plausible deniability) than a standard safe with hard-written notes. In time, I think you'll come to agree.

> Not yet. I have gotten the learner's permit. I just had to pass a written test on road safety for it. It was easy. I still haven't learnt how to drive. I know how to drive, but just not well enough to drive around in Bangalore.

Hell yeah, homie. I'm glad to hear you are on your way. I can imagine that driving in Bangalore can be quite daunting. How do you feel about the safety of it? What's the driving culture like? How is life valued among the masses? Do people [[change]] as they drive their vehicles around? What do you think of it as a status signaling game?

> I would say about 30-50% of the adults in the city. Every adult in my family has it, even if they don't drive at all. Most of the people in college are slowly getting it, most of them already have it. The pandemic is definitely affecting it.

What's it like for one of your family members to be pulled over by a police officer? If you have a traffic violation (how strict is it in your city?), is it like a small tax or fee, maybe even a price that one is happy to pay? Do you encounter obvious corruption in this space?

> Well, you have seen countless people like me. You have experience. You know me better than I know myself.

I am honored to hear that sentence from people once in a while. I appreciate the sentiment. Thank you. I could only [[hope]] to know you as well as you [[know yourself|Know Thyself]], sir. I have encountered many people who have something in common with you here or there (including myself), but you're also quite unique in my experience. 

> Yeah, the thing is, no matter how burning those questions are, I don't ask.

It takes some courage and commitment to the value of such questions.

> The day before yesterday, I was in my Engineering Physics class. There were hardly 10 people in it because many had skipped it to study for the tests. 

That blows my mind. I do not understand skipping class.

> The professor taught for a concept for 20 minutes and left us free.

This is also odd to me. That's not normally how things go in my limited experience. Are you surprised by having such a short class?

> He's also the professor who would give out free advice, talk about new awesome space stuff, philosophy, etc. 3 people were talking to him about philosophy. I badly wanted to join in the conversation, but I was shy. I eavesdropped them the entire time. I made a lot of eyecontact with the professor and he realised that I was eavesdropping and badly wanted to say something but didn't have the balls to. I pretended to study for the test. He just went on with the conversation with the other 3 people. I don't ask questions.

Next time, sir! If anyone does, you belong in that conversation. I'm sorry it's painful. As an autist, I can be a fool (I usually am anyways :P) and not feel the pain in some cases. It doesn't seem like you can avoid feeling every ounce of the stress or pain. Your goal is to minimize regret here, I take it.

> I thank you a lot for it. I really have noticed it. Thanks for trying to fill in that void. 

`/hug`. It's my honor.

> I don't care about a degree. These are the stuff I like to do when I'm free, I don't want to make a career out of it. It won't become leisure if I'm doing humanities even during my free time and in my career. I would get tired of the monotony.

Hrm. There's a lot packed into this one. I'd like to know what you think degrees are [[for|FTSO]], and I'd like to know if you are interested in understanding as well as someone who earned the degree even if you didn't have the piece of paper. Do you think that this knowledge is something that should be integrated into careers? I do not see why it could not be leisure (a technical word for me) if it were something you worked on in both your freetime and your career. Lastly, I don't see why it would be monotonous. What could be broader than the humanities? I am not bored of it, but I am very rarely bored (a blessing, surely).<<ref "ic">>

I think the issue may still be that you're pursuing it because it's merely interesting.

> I don't need to question it anymore. They are making changes to the education system. The whole structure will be changed, but the problem is that it will be around 2030 by the time it will be implemented.

What do you think about the supposed upcoming changes? Why do you think you don't need to question it anymore? 

> I don't like to participate in piracy as I would be denying the person who made it a fair return for their efforts. But yes, if I would ever need to, you'll be the person on my piracy speed dial.

You got it. `/salute`.

Why should I think you would be denying the person who made it a fair return? Can you come up with some arguments [[attacking|https://www.techdirt.com/2017/09/21/eu-buried-own-400000-study-showing-unauthorized-downloads-have-almost-no-effect-sales/]] your own position here? 

> No, I haven't. I have found a few people, but they aren't this inclined.

Oh, I bet you still don't even know how inclined I am here. I can imagine it's hard to find. That's been my experience too. Do you want to be this inclined? High highs and low lows, my friend.

> Well, they are all a step ahead I guess. I haven't met that kind of people in my life yet.

Or that you know of*. :P. 

> A bit, but not completely yet. No offense.

`/nod`. I can see that. I'm not offended. I'm doing my best, sir. And, to be fair, I cannot claim to understand even my own reasons and self completely, for a variety of excellent reasons, including several [[infinigress]]es.

> Yes, I do believe in that but I have made some modification to it. There is no point in life. All these stuff are there so that we don't get bored. But how did all of these stuff come? Curiosity. Curiosity has revolutionized humans so much that we base our entire lives on it and forget the main purpose of reproducing and dying.

Curiosity is likely insufficient as an objective, intrinsic value or motivation in life, though it is necessary for finding such a thing.

So, here we continue one of our fundamental disagreements that we've had from the beginning. I'm still trying to convince you that your life actually matters.

I predict this disagreement is the most likely cause of any end of our long-term conversation, and I'm sorry about that. I've been here countless times. `/nod`. If you find our communications dwindling, this is an important marker. My words with you are not a mere [[game]] sating my boredom or my curiosity, and I've been as clear about that as I know how to be. If you wish for me to take your words seriously here, then we will have very little to speak about: I will have too much reason to think you are simply using me as mere means. The vast majority of moral anti-realists, skeptics, relativists, egoists, and postmoderns I encounter demonstrate they have no intention of engaging in [[good]] [[faith]];<<ref "wp">> they're usually self-centered dark-triads in the ultimate analysis. I still bend over backwards to [[wrestle]] even with those who sport these redflags. However, as a matter of [[The Golden Rule]], including equalizing our skin in the game, those who think what we're doing doesn't actually matter will eventually receive nearly the same treatment from me in dialectics (though, you will find I work to give people the benefit of the doubt, asymmetrically lots of time and space, wildly lower risks than I've had to take, and I still maintain even burned bridges out of [[love]] in the [[hope]]s of [[reconstruction]] - it's one of the places I respect most about myself - I [[love]] my enemies).<<ref "er">>

I'm not here to slit your throat. I hope you don't hit the rock-bottom of the blackpill here. I hope you can find a way out of that pit. It leaves a lot of scars and dead trees in our pathing. 

> Thanks a lot, mate. I hope that nobody else goes through them.

It's not pleasant to say it, but I have to warn you that you may experience it lifelong, sir. We have to learn to live with the wolf on our backs.

> Right now, like I said before, it's curiosity. Other than that, nope. I haven't given much thought into these.

Aren't you curious about objectively better reasons to pursue anything beyond boredom and curiosity?

> Yes. That hole is a bottomless pit! haha

This line stuck with me. Do you think it extends beyond the standard hedonic treadmill? What do you think of Sir Schopenhauer? Are there crucially different types of satisfaction one can achieve, and, if so, which types matter the most? What is contentment? What is joy? What is at the heart of flourishing as a member of our species? What is justified eudaimonia, sir?

> Umm... I tried urban dictionary and the whole process but I didn't understand what you meant by the meatgrinder. If you could explain what you meant, I could answer to you.

Do you maintain a moral anti-realist position? Is there any objective meaning that matters regarding the particles on the surface of this rock? Do we merely observe what is happening in a machine where nothing really matters? Are we just grinding our meat? 

> Other than completing TV Shows and distracting myself by watching them, I don't think I have committed myself to anything else.

If you ever have the chance, I'd like to see your [[TV: Library]], btw.

I think finding other worthy commitments is a worthy commitment. 

[[Love]],

[[h0p3]]

If it can be fixed, it may be a long time. I'm sorry to bear what may be bad news here, though I suspect you've known for a long time (or at least intuited it). What do you think we should do when we despise the mutual connection? Second-personal respect grows into some multi-ordered problem here. `/nod`. I wish I knew how to reason better about it. Not only is the ideal of unification unlikely, it's often the case that the relationship that would otherwise flourish instead withers alongside the untrusted node. It can be heartbreaking. Imho, sometimes the kindest thing one can do: let them go, and give them the most charitable interpretation of your opponent you can muster ([[silence]] sometimes being that).
