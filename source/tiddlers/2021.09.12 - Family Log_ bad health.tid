title: 2021.09.12 - Family Log: bad health

!! How has your health been this week?

* 1uxb0x
** Mild, because I have carpal tunnel.
* j3d1h
** Four shots in quick succession is not okay.
* k0sh3k
** Mostly good health this week, although sleep wasn't great and I've spent the last couple days very crampy. 
* h0p3
** Sleep was bad. I am extremely fortunate to not actually have to give AF. Blurry week, but I felt good. Footbaths and masturbation good, food excellent, weigh the same as ever, so...can't complain.

!! What was interesting to you last week?

* [[ASK]] answered. She's amazing, a [[gem]]. Figuring out how we can be useful to her. 
* [[k0sh3k]]'s Greek has been coming along swimmingly. Her explanations of what she's learning makes me a little bit sick; there's too much. I'm glad she enjoys it and she's good at it. It creeps into many conversations, even little things, and that's been a joy.
** Greek is so much fun!
* Art Group was special; it was clear how much it mattered to everyone there. 
* Shopping was fun and we got what we needed and then some. I'm feeling better about our reserves. I'm hoping that over the next year, it will be fully stocked. 
* [[FTO]] satisfied.
* [[5c0ut]] has had consistently very little contact with anyone. Curled-up schizoid mode. He is taking care of himself though, and he's getting plenty of laughs in (that we can hear).
* Walks were the shit. 
* I found out I have carpal tunnel.
* Doc says I need some real friends.
* Art has been a struggle.

!! Outside of our immediate family, who did we have significant social interactions with? 

* TopExpert5455, Scott, [[Root Users]], [[search_social]], [[ASK]], Neighborhood Joe, Reggie, Sonum, Elaine of The Farmhouse, Tex the Counselor, Troglodyte, [[anon]]s, [[FTO: Ping]] (met a match, though I'm insane to handle), my daughter's pediatrician
* AT, who got me coffee; CA, who officially resigned this week. 
* Smokey & Randy, Butter, matoune, Q&A

!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family (including ourselves)?

* 1uxb0x
** I'm actually improving at playing scout in tf2-although my aim is terrible, I'm not getting insulted.
** You've done an excellent job organizing material in the house, including bathroom, kitchen, and downstairs. I don't think you realize how far youv'e come in taking responsibility for this kind of work. It's impressive.
** I like dad jokes because you like them. It's ironic and hilarious to me. Your offspring, should you choose to cultivate any, will be very lucky to know your evolving sense of humor.
** Thank you for doing some school work every day this week, even when you misremembered the day and started work very late. 
** You did a good job shopping this time around! You picked out stuff on your own and got some really cool items. Nice shoes, bro! 
** Thank you for trying to find games and whatnot to spend time with me on.
* j3d1h
** I think I've been paying closer attention to my mental/emotional state lately.
** Thank you for helping immediately fix the Bob problem. Your solution was the correct one too. I'd have wasted time, and you prevented that.
** You did an excellent job in being an active, self-advocating patient negotiating a mutual understanding of her health descriptions and prescriptions with experts.
** You've been thinking more about your impending realm of driving. Keep going. You've got it.
** I like that you were thoughtful about your purchases, checking for the quality of items and making decisions wisely. Good job! 
** It could well be said that I'm addicted to being with you.
* k0sh3k
** Greek is fun, and I'm doing a good job studying it. 
** Girl, I've enjoyed spending my time in the kitchen with you, mornings and evenings. We've made delicious things that hit the spot and had fun. All my yes.
** You were correct again about the coffee. I agree. I concede. I will rework my entire epistemology in payment. 
** Thanks for helping me reason about clothes and accessories to buy.
** Thank you for helping my tag and title things.
* h0p3
** I've done a good job of giving people my best. Feel like I connected well with many given what we had. 
** Thank you for watching Project Runway with me. I'm //pretty sure// you wouldn't watch those of your own free will and it's a trap, but I still appreciate that you spend some of your time with me watching stupid shows. 
** Thank you for making so many compromises (and having this much patience) on the business cards.
** Thank you for buying me tons of mints, I think they'll last me 4-6 months and that's a long time.
