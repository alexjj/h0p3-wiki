Disclaimer: unapologetically myself, drama-free, live-laugh-love, positivity without accountability, seeking good vibes only. No labels or rules, but must accept me for my Zodiac signs, favorite GTA V Stations, and weaponized exes. Very sensitive and need to feel cared for regardless of your mental state. If any, anticipate asymmetrical reciprocation because I'm not responsible for your emotions even though I'll hold you responsible for mine. Obviously, you can't handle me at my worst. You're here to validate me, otherwise don't take yourself seriously because I won't, and my opinion should come out of your mouth without me having to puppet you like a parrot. Ready for companionship but not a relationship. I like music, traveling, and fun. Check my insta, but don't expect me to respond. You're consenting, of course.

Yes, I am committed to both logical monism and The Dialetheia. Beyond the empiricist's Lottery Paradox acceptance and rejection of inconsistent conjuncts conjoined, and beyond whether or not we recognize our inconsistency in the same mental breath, even on the purely rationalist's grounds (even for attempts at agnosticism), justified belief is not necessarily consistent in all possible contexts, and under closure it necessarily must agree to a true contradiction that "explodes" through everything that rests upon that which is undecidable for us and more (which is everything). Rationally accepting an account of rational acceptance (and rejectability insofar as it might meaningfully differ) gets real ugly here, and insofar as alethic justifications are insufficient, surely prudential justifications may fill in the gaps. I will agree that the telos of rationality entails not only [[aim]]ing for consistency (as is feasible), but far, far more. That is a place the moral whole intervenes upon and cashes out the relevance of the epistemic normativity subset, paradoxes implied. Insofar as the moral law is composed of that which isn't discretely algorithmic, we happen upon the virtue-theoretic decisions for which probabilistic contradictions must be rejected (even through sublation) prima facie as well. I'll even agree that schizophrenia is brought about by implicitly imposing this model on our [[phenomenology]]; hard to get to monism without it.

It's a spiritual event you say? Do you really believe that whatever happens, anything other than trying to relax and enjoy it as much as we're able will only waste our precious time?

Gender-based quests for identity have been some of the primary energizing forces in the history of civilization. In some cases, without that struggle, we relapse into the cozy but unchallenging slave-nursery, ruled by another, failing to become functioning adult specimens, let alone eudaimonic, let alone justified.
