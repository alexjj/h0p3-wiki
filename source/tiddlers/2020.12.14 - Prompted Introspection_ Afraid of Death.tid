title: 2020.12.14 - Prompted Introspection: Afraid of Death

!! Are you afraid of death? Why or why not?

[[Death]] is a common topic for me.<<ref "i">> There's probably ~1k direct references to it (and I'm not sure how to begin to quantify indirect reference here) in my [[ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱]] thus far. I am regularly aware of being-toward-death. Every [[CTS]] is loaded with it, and plenty of [[Prompts]] deal in it. My [[Root]] points toward it. I can find it in my sidebar. There are some examples of thinking about [[this question|2017.11.28 - /b/]] before. [[DeathOfRobinhood]], of course, causes me to think about it too. In some respects, I have learned to die for a while now; it's part of my job as a philosopher.

Like many people my age, I'm not so enamored with living, particularly since the moral costs of hedonic happiness are so high that life might only be merely livable otherwise in our contexts.<<ref "e">> That said, I have begun enjoying living more again,<<ref "t">> and I'd prefer to live. Yeah, I'm afraid to die, and in multiple respects and for multiple reasons. I don't want to experience the pain of dying, and I don't think my death would be good for my offspring at the moment.<<ref "n">> My obligations have not been met in general,<<ref "a">> and so I fear death. 

There's also this thin sliver of a [[hope]] that people will choose to be better than they have been (it is possible, [[ridtyawtr]]), that the world would be transformed, that I would free to not have to almost vainly pursue an answer in the desert to this golem, that I would be able to live my life in pursuit of pure pleasure.<<ref "k">> I [[hope]] to come back fiercer than ever for this.

<<footnotes "e" "Equality, equity, whatever you need to call it to, is so much higher a price than it looks. We are all reminded of Sir Singer's many hypocrisies here.">>

<<footnotes "t" "There's something to having children that changes this question and answer so much. The costs of passing one's memes and genes can be quite high. The obligations that arise are hard to fathom, especially if one is too naive.">>

<<footnotes "n" "Technically, if I could find anyone who actually gave a shit about engaging in [[justice]] (haven't found one yet, `/fingers-crossed`), my death might be even more costly. I am nihilistically comforted by the thought that nobody actually gives a persistent fuck what I think on this one (though my family comes the closest). I don't know anyone who isn't a drug-user.">>

<<footnotes "a" "I do not own myself as much as I'd enjoy. I am tired of fighting the one of the greatest lies the egoists have told in history.">>

<<footnotes "k" "I know, I know: for a person who [[masturbates]] and consumes as much as I do, surely I'm already so close to that as it were.">>
