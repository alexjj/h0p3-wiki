[[TTTOTW]] + Dark Chocolates. Thought it was daughter making the noise at 1am. It was my son. His addiction is eating into his justified eudaimonic productivity. As long as his mother is happy with his work, I'm not in much of a position to complain. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

Oh, hello there, [[ASK]]. `/wave`.

No sleep. I tried for hours. She's up now. Hugs'n'bugs. M'theydy made some coffee for us while doing her lashes. She came back inside after having left, pissed. Our favorite young creatures left the entire carton of chicken in the trunk, never taking it out (I was wondering why I had to thaw chicken for Indian food; I assumed nobody listened to me again, and, technically, that was true for not having done what I asked with the chicken). Her car smelled really bad. XD. Classic prank of negligence, I guess.

It wasn't s_s. Okay. Just a coincidence, I guess. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Hugs'n'bugs with muh offspring. I didn't get to see much of my son at all today, but he was in a good mood.

Talking with [[ASK]]. They are okay for now, maybe even gonna have some fun this weekend. Good. A lot on their plate. The asymmetry is tremendous. I'm glad they are curious. I like their vocabulary and metaphors, and, ofc, they are gonna be pretty disappointed in how autistic I am. I lack the emotional reason that many would assume I should have given other parts of what they see of me. Their introspection is sincere and piercing. 

Took my daughter to our hospital to see her pediatrician. She led us the entire way, I was her dummy (usually am anyway). She had her notes and order of discussion set, and I just stayed in the waiting room. Plus, a new mother was nursing (perfect slope) in an extremely sheer black dress (with sunlight pouring through the windows, and clearly no underwear, thank the babymaker); she was quite busy for well over half an hour, while I played with my toy wishing I could play with my other toy. Life is good. Eventually, I was called in for confirmation. Fleshed out some family histories and added evidence to support my daughter's claims (I was asked for my opinions too, so I gave them). I was clear that my daughter is in charge here; she's being careful, mature, and it's her body. The doctor was patient, but I think offput by my interaction (surprise!). Needles and tests since this is practically like a first visit all over again (last time was just a couple weeks before covid hit). My daughter has control of her account, and she's scheduling the rest. Our drive there and back was pleasant. We spent time thinking about how to drive, the signs, mindsets, etc. This creature may soon be driving one of these machines.

I tried to sleep again. Nope. Fuck. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. I almost went for a walk, but it was late. 

//Raw Skintime//, extended. This is exactly what I've needed. I've been promised tomorrow. `/chuh-ching`. M is driving her insane (everyone it seems), and I agree it's clear that A has been forced to do this (C and S should have been handed co-interim-dir [oh, and C officially announced...and, perhaps with him leaving, Sr will feel compelled to jump ship...I hope no]). Only two more PT sessions left. Greek class was a cinch (I hope it stays that way). International students are having trouble, they weren't directed to do their paperwork, so it's fucking with her schedule further. We wrestled until I lost. Straight for the nuts, like a cheater.

Made dinner with her. Burritos, watermelon, and quick pickles. [[TTTOTW]].

Art Group! More bugs than usual in our software tonight, I couldn't even think straight about basic shit (no sleep for 30 hours), and everyone was clearly running on little to no sleep to be there ([[g r a t i t u d e|Gratitude]]). I got to hear her voice. Blessed relief. Her rodent pets appreciate her company, but her microwave is dead (lucky squirrels, she's always hungry). She's got too many dishes to do. She's exhausted, can't get enough sleep, living the grindlife, and she's working late too. By the end of the week, she is, like, so over it. There's a sadness in how she must budget her weekends. She's being patient, keeping some of her expectations low to make space to cultivate her relationships. She's keeping her head above water, but maybe it is a slow drowning (I do not know). I have to find a better answer for her because I think it's killing her. At least their trip seemed to be a solid break (though seeing extended family may be draining in some cases). No luck on the letterboxes, and they've run out within their area. I wonder if a different outdoor activity is warranted, but it's been crazy hot. I think she's marching. Never give up. I very much enjoy watching autocompletes in the omnibar (I want to see her phone now). I made a request for a list of artistic software for my daughter, as I know they have opinions based on having used a lot of software. I get to see her living on the screen. I feel much better. We (mostly they, really, as I watched and listened) made [[art]].
