[[Variety Creepy]]
1:50 PM

Hey! What's up? Long time no talk!

[[h0p3]]
5:03 AM

Yo! =)

[[Variety Creepy]]
5:04 AM

Hello!

[[h0p3]]
5:04 AM

I've been staying busy. Workin on the house, school with offspring, family time, doing my reading and writing.

How about you?

[[Variety Creepy]]
5:05 AM

Well, I was busy with my birthday, my religion's New Year. And then other stuff. Also, if you're watching the news regularly, you might have come across the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic in India. There's lockdown going on at the moment in my state.

[[h0p3]]
5:07 AM

How seriously is the lockdown taken?

[[Variety Creepy]]
5:07 AM

Well, nobody can go out unless you're going to the pharmacy.

Food delivery can take place.

But if you are purchasing stuff like going to the grocery store, you have to do it from 6 am to 10 am in the morning

Just a 4 hour gateway

My city recorded 22.6 thousand cases yesterday. My state recorded nearly 40 thousand. In total, India recorded 380k cases.

[[h0p3]]
5:10 AM

=(

How do you feel about vaccination roll outs in each scope?

[[Variety Creepy]]
5:12 AM

It's horrible. My country did more exports of vaccines than it should have. They should have prioritised ourselves first

I've received my first dose. I need receive my second dose of the Astrazeneca vaccine on May 7th or 8th along with my brother. My parents are both fully vaccinated.

[[h0p3]]
5:12 AM

Meanwhile, my country has immorally hoarded, sitting on answers that could be given away.

Dope

[[Variety Creepy]]
5:14 AM

Well, it's true that they did that. But they're giving away the AZ vaccines they have hoarded. But the worst thing USA did was delay the export of a certain vaccine raw material for a month.

[[h0p3]]
5:14 AM

Also been attempts to hoard based on IP rights.

[[Variety Creepy]]
5:15 AM

India has a very high vaccine manufacturing power. But a raw material required was only produced in USA and China. It did affect the vaccine rollout.

Yep. That's true.

[[h0p3]]
5:15 AM

(and hoarding within the state itself, the wealthy were the first to have access, by far)

[[Variety Creepy]]
5:16 AM

They should have not have given IPR to vaccines for the pandemic. We're dealing with a pandemic here but the EU and USA had a different view on it

[[h0p3]]
5:17 AM

There are some who have been working for years to build organizations that profit from pandemics, and we're seeing that play out.

I agree that we should abolish IPR completely.

It is a grave crime against humanity.

[[Variety Creepy]]
5:18 AM

Yeah, wealthy people do really shit things. Haha, due to the second wave, India was not able to do the regular pharmaceutical exports like they did prepandemic. Angela Merkel was so pissed she that she literally threatened India saying the entire continent of Europe will take action if the don't send in the supplies in time.

I totally agree

We shouldn't abolish IPR completely, but when it comes to stuff that involves life or help the health industry, they should abolish it over there. But for other stuff, let IPR be there.

[[h0p3]]
5:20 AM

No.

Completely.

Unless we want to be extremely technical about what an IP right consists in.

[[Variety Creepy]]
5:21 AM

Hmmm

[[h0p3]]
5:21 AM

Taken to the limits, there are some things we normally wouldn't call an IP right that actually might count as one.

[[Variety Creepy]]
5:22 AM

If we try to become ultra specific, people will just find loopholes to enforce IPR. Yeah, abolishing them completely would work

[[h0p3]]
5:23 AM

The innovation we care about is largely driven by public work and funding.

[[Variety Creepy]]
5:24 AM

Well I know this because my Dad makes laws for the country. He sees so many people trying to evade taxes through so many loopholes. It's just a huge mess

[[h0p3]]
5:24 AM

It is the capitalist who wields IPR to oppress the masses.

[[Variety Creepy]]
5:24 AM

You may be right.

Yep.

[[h0p3]]
5:24 AM

How difficult is it to do one's taxes in various parts of India?

[[Variety Creepy]]
5:24 AM

What is your views on Capitalism? Are you leaning towards socialism or communism?

Well, my Dad doesn't do taxes. He works in the ministry of finance.

[[h0p3]]
5:26 AM

I'm a socialist.

[[Variety Creepy]]
5:26 AM

He deals with commercial taxes like VAT and GST

Not income tax

Same, I'm a socialist too

[[h0p3]]
5:27 AM

[[Redpilled Socialism]]

[[Justice]]

[[Variety Creepy]]
5:28 AM

As for doing taxes, everything is online. It's quite easy, actually

[[h0p3]]
5:30 AM

We do ours online too. It's heavily shaped by private interests. Most use a corporation to file taxes, a company that pays to keep tax code complex enough that it requires them as a middleman.

[[Variety Creepy]]
5:31 AM

That's horrible

[[h0p3]]
5:31 AM

The IRS, meanwhile, is squeezed and hammered so that it cannot collect taxes from the wealthy (both what is legally owed and what is morally owed).

[[Variety Creepy]]
5:32 AM

Same...

Only the modern day slave labourers pay taxes.

[[h0p3]]
5:34 AM

It's a daunting task. I don't know what we should do about it. I don't predict our success.

[[Variety Creepy]]
5:35 AM

Well, nothing can be done until the world is run by people with selfish reasons who can be bought by the MNCs

[[h0p3]]
5:37 AM

The transnational entities (including even some extremely wealthy individuals) are not subject to the rule of law anywhere.

I agree.

[[Variety Creepy]]
5:38 AM

I know. it's horrible

The worst thing is these people will never let a really deserving person become wealthy

It's almost like a bunch of dynasties

[[h0p3]]
5:40 AM

I agree that we do not live in a true meritocracy, though I think it is quite difficult to isolate what consists in merit.

I think the Maximin Rule will likely limit political power inequalities that include wealth.

And, yes, dynasties continue around the world. You are correct.

Wealth transfer through the generations will continue to enable the concentration of power.

[[Variety Creepy]]
5:43 AM

The Maximum Rule have already limited political power to themselves. It's already happening and has happened for a few decades

Yep, there will another French Revolution in all countries in the near future

It may happen in our lifetime

[[h0p3]]
5:46 AM

Yes. I agree. Let us hope.

[[Variety Creepy]]
5:46 AM

Or maybe even earlier

[[h0p3]]
5:46 AM

I disagree with Saint Marx in many places. He could not have foreseen what turing machines could accomplish.

It is not obvious to me that successful revolution is inevitable.

[[Variety Creepy]]
5:47 AM

I don't agree with Marx in everything. You're right about the machines

The rebellion may be successful but I really do not have high hopes for it

[[h0p3]]
5:48 AM

It's a real test of our metal.

[[Variety Creepy]]
5:48 AM

Yeah but it is just a cycle

After the Revolution, new dynasties will emerge

Who will inevitably do the same thing

It's just a shift of power

[[h0p3]]
5:50 AM

There are ways to firmcode the decentralization of many structures in societies, to distribute them globally such that the workers own the means of political power production.

Oh, I think those turing machines are double-edged swords. The cycling can spiral in a particular direction.

(though, as you point out, I do not have high hopes that it will be a good direction either)

[[Variety Creepy]]
5:52 AM

Yep. Even if you do whatever you want to break the system, they will fall back to the old ways. Old habits really die hard

Which section of society do you think will monopolise everything? I have a theory that the section that rises to  a position of control will get it

[[h0p3]]
5:55 AM

[[Power]]

[[Variety Creepy]]
5:55 AM

It will not the the revolutionaries who start it. Because you know, a revolution always eats its own revolutionaries. So, it will be the ones who come after them

[[h0p3]]
5:56 AM

My assumption is that power will continue to concentrate into the hands of the few who are subject to no one's laws but their own, sovereigns in everything but name. Contradictions in the system will eat from the bottom up.

Some methods of revolution are safer than others.

I agree that some reactionaries will stand to benefit.

I have a lot of murderers in my family, proud of their military "service."

[[Variety Creepy]]
5:58 AM

Yeah, you're right. The people in the second place in top in the Revolution will get it. Or maybe those who instigate the Revolution and know when to stay silent and after the battle is won, usurp the power. They will get it

[[h0p3]]
5:59 AM

You sound almost stoic about it.

[[Variety Creepy]]
5:59 AM

I agree there are safer methods but we as humans are hot headed. I'm almost certain that there won't be a safe revolution.

[[h0p3]]
6:00 AM

I agree. Lives will be lost.

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:00 AM

Well, yes. I am certain in this because it is what I have observed in the history.

[[h0p3]]
6:00 AM

Are being lost.*

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:00 AM

Well, most people just study the European history but they miss a great deal on Middle East and Ancient India. If you look at that, it's just a repeat of cycles.

Yes, there will be bloodshed

[[h0p3]]
6:01 AM

and more

aye

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:02 AM

I do not have any members in my family who have served in the military. It is a noble thing but I doubt human military will exist in the near future.

I do not have any members in my family who have served in the military. It is a noble thing but I doubt human military will exist in the near future.

Yes, more.

I do not have any members in my family who have served in the military. It is a noble thing but I doubt human military will exist in the near future.

Yes, more.

[[h0p3]]
6:03 AM

I do not see why it is noble.

I would be quite surprised if there were no human swathes/components to militaries around the world.

Who is not engaged in warfare?

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:05 AM

Well, protecting innocent people is a good deed. I say it is noble because at least in my country, because most of the work the military does is saving innocent lives in the disaster management in cyclones, hurricanes, earthquakes, etc., than fighting in wars.

[[h0p3]]
6:05 AM

Hrm.

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:05 AM

Everyone is engaged in warfare.

But it will switch from humans to bots.

[[h0p3]]
6:06 AM

I disagree, my friend. I agree that the automation will continue to grow radically though.

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:07 AM

We have already seen what drones can do. We've seen the Houthis of Yemen destroy the biggest oil wells of Saudi Arabia suing drones.

It's a matter of time technology shifts in that direction.

[[h0p3]]
6:07 AM

I agree that the use of drones will continue to rise, alongside the crimes against humanity.

I agree it will continue to shift in that direction.

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:08 AM

Human soldiers will exist. But in really small fraction of what is present today.

That will just be there for backup

Or emergency cases.

[[h0p3]]
6:08 AM

There are many roles to be had in warfare. Many kinds of soldiers.

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:09 AM

Yes, but the ones that involve bloodshed can be replaced by bots. Also, there will be more of economic warfare than gunfire warfare.

[[h0p3]]
6:09 AM

Hrm.

In my nation, about 2% of the population own a surprising percentage of the guns on the planet.

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:10 AM

Economic warfare is already happening, but the scale it is happening right now is very less. But there will surely be more to it. My best bet is that the economic warfare will be the cause of a next world war or the next revolution.

Yes, but gun ownership by the armies will go down in the future.

[[h0p3]]
6:11 AM

Another 2% of our population are held in concentration camps. There is bloodshed here, though less "camo and tanks."

I think bloodshed comes in many degrees and kinds.

I know that seems to water down the problem too much.

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:13 AM

We cannot help about concentration camps. We have to exclude it out of the equation. We cannot do anything to them. Surely we can do something, that requires a perfectly ideal society, which doesn't exist.

[[h0p3]]
6:13 AM

I'll agree that wars will be fought by proxy and automation more and more though.

We must. We owe these humans our lives.

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:15 AM

We do.... But when you look at those who fund the people who run these concentration camps, you will be surprised.

People have selfish interests.

And so do countries.

[[h0p3]]
6:16 AM

I agree that the right thing to do will likely not succeed, but that doesn't make it not the right thing to do.

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:16 AM

If people cared, the Middle East and Africa would not have been in this sorry state it is right now.

[[h0p3]]
6:17 AM

I agree that following the money is very telling about the concentration camps.

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:17 AM

Well, you may not know that the country who openly bashes the ones that run the concentration camps will be ones indirectly supporting them.

[[h0p3]]
6:18 AM

I only see parts. I agree.

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:18 AM

What do you mean by you only see parts?

[[h0p3]]
6:19 AM

I spend a lot of time reading. I cannot see it all.

The whole.

You may find my [[Link Log]] interesting.

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:20 AM

Well, I can give make up an example.

Suppose there is a country X. It has a certain thing that drives the interests of many countries. B is one such country interested in it.

B initially approaches the government.

X government sets a price too high or deny giving it.

B gets angry. It pumps in money and fuels riots.

It also gives arms to the opposition.

And thereby starting a civil war.

[[h0p3]]
6:23 AM

This is something the US has done for a very long time.

And many nations are guilty of it.

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:23 AM

Not just the US. Even the British Empire has done it.

And so has Russia, France, Spain, etc.

[[h0p3]]
6:24 AM

(many MNCs apply these kinds of pressures too)

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:24 AM

Yeah, I know it is the MNCs who get it done.

But many nations really do not show remorse.

[[h0p3]]
6:25 AM

I agree.

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:26 AM

Don't you ever feel like, "Why are humans like this? What's wrong with all of us?"

[[h0p3]]
6:26 AM

All the time.

I'm fighting like hell.

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:26 AM

Haha. It is one point disgusting. Makes me regret for being this curious.

[[h0p3]]
6:27 AM

Ignorance is bliss sometimes. Very painful to know the truth too often.

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:27 AM

It is at one point disgusting*

Agreed.

But also, when I see others going on in their lives ignorant to all of this, my mind says, "Look at all of these people. They don't even know the lives of so many people is changing every second."

[[h0p3]]
6:28 AM

That is a very hard problem to solve.

You are correct.

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:29 AM

I sometimes feel jealous, but I'm also happy that I am aware of what is going on in society.

[[h0p3]]
6:29 AM

I am very lucky to know you. I am glad you exist. I wish there were a billion more of you in the world.

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:30 AM

Same here. I could never have this type of conversation with anyone else I know in real life

Except my Dad. Well, he was the one who fuelled these interests in me.

[[h0p3]]
6:31 AM

Your dad sounds like a fantastic man.

I'm jelly.

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:31 AM

I too am glad you exist.

[[h0p3]]
6:31 AM

What about your brother? He into discussing these topics at all?

My assumption is you both spend your time working your asses off on your studies in your rooms.

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:32 AM

He is a fantastic person. But everyone has their own issues and I cannot have these kind of conversation everyday with him.

As for my brother, he is well informed about all of this

He knows what is going on

In fact, he is always gathering all the news. He has more free time than me.

But discussing these stuff is something I don't do with my brother.

[[h0p3]]
6:33 AM

I am very surprised to hear that.

I'm sorry.

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:34 AM

We save it for one day and talk a lot about it with Dad one day.

[[h0p3]]
6:34 AM

My brothers put up with me. I annoy them a lot. =D.

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:34 AM

Well, by issues, I mean work and other stuff. Managing other stuff like the properties, helping out Mum and reading a ton of books.

That's good. my friends get annoyed if I start off with these stuff.

[[h0p3]]
6:35 AM

Yup. I know hao it do.

Lol

How is life going in general for you?

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:35 AM

Yeah XD

Um, life has been good. Kind of.

Well to be honest, I had planned on committing suicide on my birthday. But I didn't go through with it. It has been 16 days now. Yesterday I was about to do self harm. I prevented myself from doing it.

How is your life going?

[[h0p3]]
6:39 AM

That does not sound good. I am glad that you are here and less-harmed.

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:40 AM

I did a good thing of telling Mum the day before. She talked me out of it.

I'm happy to be here.

[[h0p3]]
6:40 AM

Me too.

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:41 AM

So, how is your life going on?

[[h0p3]]
6:45 AM

I am missing my [[ᛝLightᛝ]]. My brother [[AIR]] has found a cook position at nursing home. My son and I have been constructing our little shop area in the garage, organizing our tools (we've combined our tools together). I've been playing [[MTG]] with my offspring (cube drafting). We are planting. My brother [[JRE]] has a new job at a waste treatment facility, and his life has grown quite complex as a father (and he's been helping me think about how to put up insulation in our attic and thinking about how to make use of our space wisely).

[[My wife]]'s life has so many moving pieces, I have no idea how she manages it. I am lucky to get as much //skintime// with her as I can, and walks.

My daughter is depressed. I am fighting to find ways to help her climb out of the pit.

[[j3d1h]] is her name.

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:47 AM

That's pretty good! Everything sounds interesting!

Oh I'm sorry to hear that about your daughter.

Well, I think therapy might help her. It has worked like a miracle to some, but not for everyone. Well, as a person who is depressed, the only thing I suggest you to do is keep her mind occupied.\

Just keep it occupied. Do not let the mind wander.

[[h0p3]]
6:49 AM

Thank you. I will do what I can.

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:49 AM

If you let it wander, you'll start thinking and daydreaming. And when that happens, depression.

This is how I manage. It works most of the times. I wish you all the best with it.

[[h0p3]]
6:50 AM

Manage is a good word for it. Some experience it for most of their lives. The curse of knowledge.

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:50 AM

Yep....

It's hard sometimes. Sometimes there are good days. It's a cycle.

India might cross 400k daily case mark today. Or hit really close to it like 395k.

[[h0p3]]
6:55 AM

If you had to hazard a guess, how many will die in total in India when this is done, both directly from covid and indirectly?

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:56 AM

It's hard to say that because some states have been found guilty of manipulating numbers. 30-40 corpses were cremated in a day in a place and in official records, they said it was only 12 or 17

[[h0p3]]
6:57 AM

Yeah.

And, we might not even be able to find trustworthy numbers of total lives lost each year for a rough comparison either.

[[Variety Creepy]]
6:58 AM

I think based on official records, India might hit 300 or 350 thousand.

Yeah.

It's currently 205k. It would be around 300-350k

As for cases, we might peak at 500-600 thousand cases a day. But some claim that it might go up to 800k. But I doubt it. Let's see.

[[h0p3]]
7:07 AM

If you ever wrote a blog, I'd read every word of it.

(you do not need to attempt anything like that with me)

You have a strong voice.

I hope it's something you will continue to develop over your lifetime. People should hear what you have to say.

I'd be happy to even just read your notes.

[[Variety Creepy]]
7:09 AM

Thank you! I will start writing blogs but this is not the time for it. I will start it within this calendar year. Maybe in the months of September or October. I'm starting as soon as I'm done with my exams

I will try making notes in my journal whenever I think of any. I send pictures of them. I hope you can manage to read my cursive! :)

[[h0p3]]
8:07 AM

I would be honored to read your cursive. I think you'd be severely disappointed by my own chickenscratch.

[[Variety Creepy]]
8:08 AM

My handwriting is no better than a chicken scratch either😂

Hey, okay. I've been thinking and I'll write on how to I would start developing a newly formed country from scratch. I'll make some mind mapping in my journal and then create a blog to write the entire stuff. I'll send you the mind map in about 45-60 minutes.

[[Variety Creepy]]
8:51 AM

If I were to manage a country https://imgur.com/a/a3q0owB

Here's the notes

[[Variety Creepy]]
10:04 AM

Hey man, I'm writing the blog but I'm not satisfied with it

[[Variety Creepy]]
10:33 AM

I've written this.

Okay. How did the Biden picture come out of nowhere?

[[Variety Creepy]]
10:59 AM

I'm not satisfied with it. But it's my first try, so let's see.

[[h0p3]]
11:53 AM

Your handwriting is gorgeous, lmao.

The Hardy Boyz logo is perfek <3

I want to understand what machine decided to add that image too. Lol.

[[Variety Creepy]]
11:58 AM

I could do better with the handwriting. But I wrote it on a 'on the best desk'. It makes it a bit wobbly

[[h0p3]]
11:58 AM

Biden's idea of how to form a new country would be much sadder to read.

Well, it puts my chickenscratch to shame. I often can't even read my own lol. I have to squint and guess from the context.

[[Variety Creepy]]
11:59 AM

Yeah, I really like Jeff Hardy. He's my favourite wrestler and I love the logo. Even though I quit watching WWE 2 years ago, I still use it.

I really don't know, I was surprised XD

I didn't expect any picture to come, let alone Biden of all people

I can read my handwriting. I guess it makes me feel a bit better, lol

[[h0p3]]
12:00 PM

Teaching me new words too. "hydel" - dope.

Wrestling is an important metaphor for me.

[[Variety Creepy]]
12:01 PM

That's just a term for Hydroelectric. Lol

Nice!

[[h0p3]]
12:04 PM

I have a personal request: please maintain your writing data on your machine too. Medium is just an outlet to distribute copies. You hold the originals and working drafts.

It's excellent work. We're very lucky to think about your words.

[[Variety Creepy]]
12:05 PM

Oh I did not know that. Okay, I'll create a partition in my hand disk for blogs drafts.

Thanks. But I didn't understand by the "We're very lucky to think about your words."

[[h0p3]]
12:07 PM

You've taken time to tell us how you think and feel. I'm glad you are sharing yourself with others. We, the audience, are lucky to know you.

[[Variety Creepy]]
12:09 PM

Oh okay. Thanks a lot!

[[Variety Creepy]]
1:02 PM

Hey

Do you have any recommendations for the blog? Like any suggestions or comments?

[[h0p3]]
4:08 PM

I think you should write often and about whatever is important to you or whatever you think should be important to you.

I think you should see your work as a draft. Preserve your evolution, say words that you will be proud you said 10 years from now, and write even when you don't want to. Get it out.

I have a place you should consider: https://multiverse.plus/signin

I know one of the developers well enough, and I know the community mood enough to tell you that it's a place where you will be safe and perhaps find comfort. It is a place to be creative and to come to know [[others]] in both style and substance.

That place is in private beta. But, anyone who was interested in thinking about web design would be surrounded by rockstars there. And, yes, even a blogger should concern themselves with the code running underneath all the hoods.
