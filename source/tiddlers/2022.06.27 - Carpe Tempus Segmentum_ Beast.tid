Icewater. //Skintime// with my sympaticon + //Slither//.

Sleep by 1:30?

Woke at 9. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

Watering the [[garden]] with my sympaticon. The pepper plants are gettin' big. I'm feeling confident we will have peppers (which is the most important thing, by far, since it's the only way my sympaticon will have access to pepper-based spice).

Washer utility room is a mess. Cleaning. We've gotten good use out of that washer, but it may be on its last legs (and not just the rubber pieces it slips off of that are annoying to position). [[TTTOTW]].

Mi amor and I took the vehicles to the shop. AC unit on these Hondas are known problems, and the mileage is low enough that we might be able to have Honda cover it. Will see. Otherwise, in good shape. Going for the very expensive synthetic because we've encountered enough people who swear up and down by it. Dude also said I should do it for the SUV with +206k miles on it. Leaks we've had for years. Here's the weird thing, homie (who told us his life story, how much he hates CT compared to NY, and more) who obviously knew quite a bit, suggested we sell it instead of driving into the ground, as it has so few electronics and somehow SUVs are selling for enormous amounts (even at crazy high mileage). We paid $4k (which I thought considerably overpriced) at the time for it many years ago. Homie says we should be able to get over 10k (said even 15k is possible) for it. Seems unlikely to me. Okay. Let's try.

//The Walk// with mi amor. Went into a couple shops to escape the heat. Saw Jessica Rabbit workin at the store. Talked to a headshop worker who appears to be a new immigrant (cool dude) likely exploited by the guy in charge. Talked about business. Looked at their prices. CBD 3g tincture for $80, but he's never seen one sold (I can make it for hedged $5, probably more to make it fancy and what not). He sells carts though. 1.5g Δ⁸ for $30, and that I can do for maybe hedged $4, though no idea on packaging, etc. Worse margins than CBD. Nobody has any mixtures, which we could sell. Good news is that viscosity on these products varies so much that it's hard to automate their manufacturing. We can compete by hand. Talked with the Chinese food shop we've never even seen open before, and they are moving. Kid listened, and I yessir'd up and down. Sitting on the sidewalk eatin' a quick meal and drinkin a ginger-inspired beverage. Worried about the coming months. We are pretty depleted.

[[TTTOTW]]. //Tigana//.

[[Family Time]] in [[The Den]]. It's too hot. I much prefer being on [[m16]] for it too. =D. //Good Omens// meant it was time to sleep. And, I did. I was toast.

Woke at 5:30. Lieutenant Dan. Fireman Time!

Chilled with mi amor. She did sleep, but today is going to be a deluge of e-mails. Almost 2 weeks of build-up. Not lookin' forward to it.

Eggrolls, water. [[TTTOTW]]. //Skintime// with my sympaticon. Put her to bed. [[TTTOTW]]. Gave galacteek another shot. 

Called up the Honda dealer. No go. As suspected from lookin' it up, the vehicle is not one of the newer models that had the problem. Welp. I'm still pleased to have the vehicle regardless.

[[1uxb0x]] and I went out to The Beast to clean it, and my sympaticon joined us. I only move stuff to make space for other stuff (including persons), but I've never actually cleaned it (it's a work vehicle). Vacuumed and wiped it down (a lot of surfaces to hit). It's still not detailed, but it's sellable. We'll be keeping the back rubber matter for ourselves since it doesn't look nearly as pretty (though we find it useful) as the fabric underneath (assuming the vehicle even sells). Gonna keep cleaning it up some more, inside and out. Take pictures. This go around, [[1uxb0x]] will be working to sell. Worst case scenario, he got some practice in and the vehicle looks better than [[the day we bought it|2017.08.05 - Carpe Diem Log]]. As much as I like having a truck, van, or suv: gas is too fucking expensive, and these machines are wildly overpriced (totally opposite in Thailand given their import laws and domestic manufacturing).

[[TTTOTW]].

//Beavis and Butthead Do The Universe// was exactly what you thought it would be. We managed 31 minutes of it before none of us could take it. A worthy experience, and I'm sad to say that I don't enjoy it like I used to. I am these kids though. <3. Some grind on the project, but they are going slower than molasses. Ugh.

[[TTTOTW]]. Dadnap. Woke up woozy, closed eye hallucinations. Fuck it. Back to bed. Woke at 6.

//Skintime// with mi amor. She is feeling blue today. Walked me through a busy day. M and J are bitches, and she's slicing through it, making room for their boss (they ran C off, and she's hoping to avoid such a thing again). 2/3rds of her students are grad-u-tating, so she's trying to stagger on the next hire (lots of requests to work there, so she has it so easy here, it's absurd<<ref "f">>). Lots of anxiety. She was feeling better and cheered by the end though.

We have wild pumpkins growing in our yard. That is a surprise. [[TTTOTW]]. Mi amor and my sympaticon have been hoping to plant pumpkins, and I've been arguing against it for many months now. I suppose the decision has been made. `/nod`. Many cheers from the winners.

[[Family Gathering]]. We had a delicious bake, with a cheesy layer that dripped down into the noodles. Chilled and watched some [[vidya]] about China. The Sex Doll episode of //House//.

//Skintime// with my sympaticon.

A Flash.

[[TTTOTW]].

//The Walk// with my sympaticon. Quiet one.
