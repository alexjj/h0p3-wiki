!! Do you have a tattoo? What is it and why did you get it? If not, would you ever get one? What would the tattoo be, and what would it symbolize to you?

I do have one. I got it when I was ~21 with all the rest of my old immediate family and my wife as well. I've not ASCIIfied it into the wiki yet. It's a Celtic-knotted cross with ancient Greek that reads: "Slave of The One God." Some people prefer the word servant, of course. It is not my only mark of this [[faith]]. It's been interesting to see my feelings change about it over the years. I still admire aspects of it quite a bit. I do believe in the divine, though I am not a theist.<<ref "e">>

I've been thinking about one for my family, [[Family: Tattoo]]. I probably won't get another one unless it's my daughter drawing it on me. I've considered buying her the equipment many times.
