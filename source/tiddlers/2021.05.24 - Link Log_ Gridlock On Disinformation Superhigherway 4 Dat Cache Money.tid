*** Doesn't even scratch the surface, and reads somewhat like a self-aware wolf. Few technical reasons, basically no discussion of hardware, lacks examples of tools that have worked or could except simply a lack of interest. Political solutions are fundamental though. I agree. Still neo-lib at the heart, it seems. I ask you to think about what it means for the workers to own the means of production. Some of these problems disappear when people want to own their machines and data (an expensive task, no doubt), and that can't be solved by a market either except in virtue of oppression (ironically). I agree that the market will not produce the answers we need. Still, you have my interest.
