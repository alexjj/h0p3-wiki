title: 2020.08.15 - Prompted Introspection: Fridge

!! Name four items that can always be found in your refrigerator.

Always? Probably nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and argon. I've had plenty of nearly empty fridges. There are no items that we exceptionlessly maintain in our fridge, especially since we often remove those items even just temporarily to use them. There are items that I've tended to have almost all the time in the fridge for a given year, but it becomes harder to nail down anything when we stretch this timeslice across my life. 

Toward answering this [[prompt]] like a normie, I'd say we tend to maintain soy milk, non-dairy butter, strawberry jam, and an oil-based salad dressing. There's probably 20 items that we will have 80% of the time in our fridge at this point.
