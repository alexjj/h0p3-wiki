title: 2021.08.26 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Much Better

Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. [[Ping]]ed a very odd person. `/wave`. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! Cleaning. Salad + Wine + LolVod. Going slow on muh [[Letter]] to madame senpai. I feel there is more to digest before I release it from draft, and I want it to be something I can look back on and find both satisfying and entertaining.<<ref "w">> Attempted sleep at 5ish. 

Woke at 11:30. Headache, wired AF. Racing. I know I dreamt. Meditation. I keep remembering things I meant to add to the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱, but I don't always make it in time. Planning for the day from bed. [[TTTOTW]]. Called up the oil company twice. Full mailbox. Will keep trying. [[TTTOTW]]. Assignment. Got a'hold of 'em. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

Lightning Struck! Relief.

I got to see [[5c0ut]] more than usual today as he was doing laundry.

Offspring and I worked on practical matters. She's got upstairs and then set up for dinner tomorrow (we were going to scrounge tonight after seeing her timeline and pushing it back to tomorrow, but we ended up not scrounging). He worked on the basement. We had to clear out the area for Dave, but my son went above and beyond and whipped it into shape (I directed, then did [[The Den]] and some living room). 

We moved onto our computing [[project]]s. She's found a neat printable "shiny" coating layer (and her pricing has confirmed we should go bulk, and that we probably won't have an offline card), so we're thinking about how to go even more baroque on this bitch. As far as I'm concerned, the card has to mimic the "₩Һ𝘢ʈ ╤ћᘓ 𝔽ᵁʗꗪ is this noise?" one experiences in encountering the 
ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 itself. Almost feels like reification. We'll just keep embellishing until it becomes self-aware (sounds like the evolution of homo sapiens anyway). I have to add that she understands her tooling and the entire negotiating process much better this time around (she's obviously been working with people more too). I was wrong about my son's progress for setting up my wife's [[RGM]]. We had several miscommunications, but these were handled smoothly (and I'm glad that I'm not having to hold his hand so much...the manboy is even posting on suitable forums [I find speaking to many loonix users to be an unfortunate task, as the DD requirements to stave off helpvampires are pretty high among the Arch-adjacent communities, often enough, and I admire his fearlessness] to try to find answers).

Unfortunately, Dave The Capitalist didn't show up until 5ish (we were all downstairs, so we had a difficult time hearing him [I had decided he wasn't going to show up]...glad he went around the side where the furnace is anyway), so we weren't able to walk.<<ref "d">> We nodded, and he knew what was up within 5 seconds (screen tells ya), verified by listening to it on another reset, grabbed the parts, and started replacing it (told us we did the right thing...but, he has vested interest in us believing that claim regardless of its truth value); I could probably do the replacement, but I wouldn't know how to test it and what to listen for like he does (he's kinda a jack-of-all-trades to do what he does, also he uses a tool backpack just like my brother's). His memory was fairly strong (remembering more than usual about us, our basement [he liked the way we have our tools and food stored, even if it isn't pretty], and especially our conversations [wherein he was able to continue where we left off...a rare treat for a Geschwind Syndrome retard]). We spoke of serving our wives. Sidestepped my question about the frequency of the igniter's failure. I sprankled in my cusswords to remind him that I am, indeed, cool. The entire system could go any day, so we really must save for that (which is hard to do at the moment). He was obviously milking the clock, but I'm glad my wife has her hot water. He's eventually hoping to add solar as well a year from now, and his arguments about energy were [[bias]]ed but still worth hearing. He didn't mind disagreeing with me, so when he agrees with me, I'm feeling better about my own opinion. His son(?) is starting third grade, and his daughter kindergarten (as usual, I had my offspring very young). He had covid, but reasoned about the airflow in his house to avoid having anyone else in his fam catch that shit. He's thinner, more set for summer, has a pool.

Boobasense went off. She's home. More or less: offspring, I hate to do this to ya, but GTFO my room, now, please (well, more of a discussion of which room they were going to work in instead of mine). Showed me what her top had been doing all day (those lucky mofos),<<ref "i">> and I stripped us both down (we don't have time to talk about politics, theology, and economics or the days of our lives right now). Inform the Men! Apparently, I am no better than [[a dog|WWDD]] with [[my tongue|https://youtu.be/6-ABqpHZzWo?t=23]]. Like holding one's breath right to the edge of drowning, I almost died this week from a lack of sex;<<ref "m">> but, I was saved just in time (that was too close, and we should be way more careful in the future). I am convinced that the concept of paradise<<ref "b">> for retards includes //Raw Skintime// for an hour every 4 waking hours. Shower of the gods!<<ref "s">>

Shopping @ W-Entity with mi amor. Since I keep the ~~satchel~~ manpurse with me in pooblick at all times now (increasing my [[EDC]] inventory space considerably [where are my 10-slot 100% WR bags, god damnit?] while keeping my shorts up [sorry, ladies]), I've been carrying around an extra mask, and came in handy. At first, when we walked in, they didn't have what we came for: there were no watermelons. The end of summer is coming, and with it a loss of meaning qua watermelonlessness. I can never have enough melons in my life. We grabbed stuff for the evening, a treat. But, we stumbled across watermelons in a new place ($5.68 a piece though, =/...they are back up in price now). My wife was confused about what I was getting, as though the meal could not possibly go together. Schizoshopping, I guess. Think we may work toward finding a self-checkout method because it does save us time.

Made dinner with my love. Blast chilling at the least minute.

[[Family Gathering]] was excellent. //House// is an excellent soap opera, and we thought about that. Fish (I'm thinking maybe I should just make my own tartar sauce, or maybe add more onions and pickles to what I get from the store), golden honeydew, deviled egg potato salad, and quick pickle cucumbers (texture is absolutely critical to food, and I'm here to argue about that at all times - if you don't think so, it's because you're wrong [so, prepare to brawl]).

Fell asleep, like a loser. I don't know, maybe 9:30 or 10?
