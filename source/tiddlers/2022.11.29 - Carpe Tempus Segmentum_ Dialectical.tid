title: 2022.11.29 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Dialectical

//Picking out what is [[salient]] for [[The Other]] is not equivalent to picking out what is salient to [[The Other]], though they are related.//

Woke at 1:15. Meditation. I am [[lucky]] to be able to simulate and parasocially interact with idealized versions of peeps (not to say it's exceptionally vivid for me, but still moving). Some might consider it insanity. Keeps me going sometimes. Capow bread (delicious). [[TTTOTW]]. Chat with [[anon]]s.

A wild [[fourmyle57]] appears...

new-storage rsync was crawling. The only answer was to kill everything touching it. Voila. Speed. Talking the jump from 5MB/s to 120MB/s top end (half that average). Wondering if containerizing file[[sharing]] applications will promote system health here. I'm working to build one machine, as I think that's what my target has to work with; that isn't ideal, I realize.

Mi amor is up. I was surprised by how quickly time flew. Coffee grinder is ded dead. I had pizza and cider. She's in good spirits this morning. I think she slept alright. Needs to take her iron. Quid pro quo letter writing. Cold AF. The plants are growing (can see new green leaves...off a $15 LED lamp too). [[5c0ut]] turned the turkey carcass into a soup. Dope.

//Skintime// + //Chicken Run// with my sympaticon. Eventually, could not stay awake. Sleep, maybe 8. She needs more too, only got 4. Didn't materialize; sometimes it is a matter of [[luck]]. We take our sleep when we can get it.

Woke at 1:45. Meditation. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. A few messages left from [[anon]]s. A note from [[fourmyle57]].

The offspring came down to grind. Can't say we got much done. My son made a github account and starting exploring the tool. Part of working together longer term, I think. 

A flash. Rescheduled. 

[[TTTOTW]].

Mi amor called pissed off. Dean pushes for a green housing unit that externalizes environmental costs and makes life harder for everyone else. Will require parking 20 minutes away with shuttles that don't cover the times everyone works. Mi amor goes in quite early, so she'll likely be able to park on nearby street, but it fucks with her crew and her students. She is voicing through the channels available to her, but it probably will have no effect. Evil people concerned more with being remembered for their legacy than their actual impact. Her day was productive, no doubt. Remote for last Greek classes, with her coaxing. It's gotta be weird to be treated like a friend outside of class while recognizing that the teacher doesn't really seem to give a shit about her students. 

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. //Inform the Men!// ~~Showe~~...no hot water. Hrm. Cleaned my dick, dried off, clothes, checked. 9 hours since the igniter had a flame. Didn't touch it though (since you only get to press it once as a non-professional). Checked the oil, and we were out according to our analog gauge. Mi amor was extra unhappy. Calls made on emergency line. 

[[Family Gathering]] was delicious. [[5c0ut]]'s soup is great. Used up all the thanksgiving leftovers. [[JRE]] called. 70F, prairie dogging, Zaxby's. Dialectics about [[Reply Mode]] and our previous conversation. Dual empathy problem, and what is health (let alone justified pursuits) in my shoes? [[Q]] goes hard on [[Bn]] in wrestling. The boys will probably begin gymnastics soon on weekends. The pain of watching our offspring take risks and getting hurt. Different parenting styles; [[Rb]] feels more beholden to their emotional states at every moment (and the boys recognize this). [[Q]] is now using multi-word sentences! A delivery of oil, spoke with the associate, relieving pressure on newly heated lines by running hot water.<<ref "w">> They say they've not had a reading since May (our last fill-up, surprisingly [will probably be every month now during the winter]). Continued dialectics. Parasociality (though, mi amor disagrees with him here, and I think it is weakly parasocial). Doesn't feel like much of a [[Root User]]. Well, I've listened deeply to every [[Root User]], whether they realized they were communicating (even in [[silence]]) or not. I've learned some very expensive lessons these past few years. I am [[grateful]]. Refusing to put the hot potato down, staring into the abyss. Vocation. I've said what I'm obligated to say with hedging to boot. I continue to listen.

Talked with mi amor some. [[TTTOTW]]. Dialectics with my sympaticon concerning [[2022.11.29 - Anonymous: Casting Nets Onto Nets]].

Drafting with [[1uxb0x]] and [[ASK]]. Flashes of [[j3d1h]], but she's out. I assume she prefers the autonomy of storytelling in AUs. It feels like just moving cardboard on the table to her. `/nod`. Oddly enough, this may be a sign of existential progress. We'll see when she makes the next moves, if she does. May she find the stories that matter most while she still has time.

Put mi amor to bed. [[TTTOTW]]. A chocolate with shot of eggnog with my sympaticon + half an //Adventure Time// episode. Sleep by 11?

<<footnotes "w" "Told the man I don't want the device anymore. If they aren't going to alert us that they device isn't working either, and I have to manually check anyway (or we can just have monthly delivery, assuming the set costs are minimal), then why keep someone else's IoT on my network? For various reasons, I do keep our network open, but that is another matter.">>
