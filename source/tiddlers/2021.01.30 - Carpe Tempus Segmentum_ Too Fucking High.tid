title: 2021.01.30 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Too Fucking High

* Fireman Time!
* Cute Naughty gifs.
** Gotta admit, pretty worried that my tastes here are way, way over the line. Fantasy is fantasy to me. Not many people can accept that. Still, folks tend to have major openness with me (I'm definitely the paranoid one; I need to relax...I trust).
* Try To Take Over The World
** Feels like a huge swirl of people I'm speaking with. 
* Sleep by 3?
* Woke a 9?
* //Skintime//
** She's tired. Not interested in having her body used today. 
* Lots of discussion. 5 people make for many interlocutorss.
* ⁸Δ⁸
* Chores
* Talking with folks...then it hit. Way crazy fucking hard. Ketamine hard. 
* Having plenty of trouble breathing through the anxiety. Weirdly enough though, I'd do it again. So many thoughts and feeling exploding as I writhed on the bed. 
** 16 hours on the bed.
** I heard snippets of folks. I know they were checking on me too. 
** Sadly, that meant we didn't go out to get warm clothes (but, thankfully, my bro can borrow mine just fine).
