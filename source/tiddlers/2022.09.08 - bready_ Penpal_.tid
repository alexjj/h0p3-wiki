What do you guys recommend a hikikomori to do with their time?

For meany reasons I do not go outside for anything other than therapy and barely leave my room. I am working on getting myself to be able to feel safe outside again, but in the mean time I need to keep myself busy between my therapy sessions.

If you're down for having a penpal, I make for a decent one: [[https://philosopher.life/#Contact h0p3]].

I haven't tried having a penpal before.... so sure

I'm ready, [[bready]], and, feel free to take your time. I'm not in a rush.

the site is confusing me....

It is confusing, `/nod`, but not purposely so. It takes some time to orient yourself in the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱. You can just bookmark [[bready]] if you want and e-mail away (or point me to where you'd prefer me to read your words). I can also appreciate that you might not be interested in penpalling after a closer look.
