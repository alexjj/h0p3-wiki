title: 2020.05.11 - TDL: Break

* [[Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden]] planting?
** Maybe that should wait too. Talk.
* Look, you can take a break if you want. You got shit to do, but it's fine if you do nothing too.
** I think it depends on what your family wants. 
* Push on the graft and [[APonting]]'s letter.
* Also, do whatever the fuck you want (within Reason), since this is your vacation.
