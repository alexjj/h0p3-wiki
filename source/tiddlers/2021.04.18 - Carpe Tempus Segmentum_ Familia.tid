title: 2021.04.18 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Familia

[[TTTOTW]]. Chips + part of LolVod. Back to the grind: [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! Fell asleep very late. 

Slept hard, thankfully. Meditation. Fireman Time! Cleaning. [[TTTOTW]]. Intrusion detected. 

[[Family Time]]. I really wanted to walk, but no go. =/. I'm glad my wife was able to join us. We tried to keep it short, only ~4 hours. :P. Actually did [[TTP]]s, and there was plenty of discussion and recounting. May they write their proofs down. A discussion with my daughter about the nature of [[/b/]]. It's a difficult place to interpret. My wife pausing more on these is a good sign, I think. Still thinking about the shape. Thinking about [[MTG]] as tarot cards, and considering The Fool. Everyone had something to say and read, and that felt good.

Played half a match with my daughter. G1 I have CoW+Strip (after E-tutor) to chip her Dungrove Elder then a hardlock, and G2 has almost exactly the same (but she had the answer this time). We're stuck though, bedtime. It will wait. =(.

My wife eventually agreed to a massage before bed. I wasn't able to crack her back in our usual fashion, and she was obviously in pain, sore all over. The second shot hasn't been the worst, but she's feeling it. Her upperbody felt better though. It's nice to see her relax. We listened to the blues.
