A very quiet VC with [[ASK]] continued. She's going through a lot. I can hear each piece being bargained for. [[TTTOTW]] and more fun work on this USB drive. There's decades of computer use that's gone into selecting what will sit on this contraption. It reminds me of building characters too. [[TTTOTW]] (I'm doing a bad job getting [[CTS]] done).

Sleep by 3. Woke at 8:30. Shit. I forgot that we were going to see [[Dune]] (I had in my mind that it was tomorrow, and worrying about being late for artgroup). Well, they don't want to come, so at least [[The Den]] will be of use to them.<<ref "i">>

Bought 50 of them meal prep containers (we're down to our last 5ish). [[TTTOTW]]. Chatted with [[chameleon]]. She's gonna be within 2 hours of me. I'm gonna drive and see her (take her home if she wants). 

They continued painting the bottom of the table. It's looking good. [[5c0ut]] chilled some with us. Talked some shop on our projects. They tested out [[The Bootable USB Thumbdrive]] and thought it quite useful. Noice. Walked them through everything in it. Huge discussion of jails, sandboxing, virtualization, and Qubes. This got us into unikernels, FPGA, embedded, (Arduino clones of the Rubber Ducky), and [[Rust]]'s place in a very special land, etc. Covered RAID concepts, backup vs redundancy, and why I like Unraid. Looked at my old switchblade/hacksaw. Rubber Ducky came up again. Talked about the flaws and beauty of that much privilege.

//The Walk// with my offspring was excellent. School was whatever. They made minimal progress on our projects, but non-zero. We talked about botnets, advanced topologies, and building our own toys. Talked about some greyhats that snowballed edged-router botnets. My scanning of the interwebs with zmap on a 7 dollar budget in less than 10 hours (port 22, ofc). Rubber Ducky discussion again. Selection rather than dropping so that 48% do the deed for you. They're considering it. Seems like such a leet project.

A flash! I'm excited. 

[[TTTOTW]].

Chatted with [[JRE]] about the table, looking for advice. He suggested going small, but he's right that it's probably a bad idea (and we aren't doing it correctly in the end). I'll think some more about it. Doesn't really need to be amazing. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Pizza center did not hold up. Wet. Ugh. We ate around.

[[Dune]]. I don't know what this film means to someone who has not [[Straussian]]ly read the book, and the three oldest were unsure how anyone else would see this as well (we were all asking ourselves if this movie would call out to anyone who didn't practically worship the book). `/wave` to you, dear wanderer (I'm a dork too, obviously :P). Hi, I'm [[h0p3]], as I said. Only 5 people in the entire theater. No staff anywhere, fully automated, I vaped openly as they hit the spice, we brought our snacks, shuffled around, reclined in these electronically controlled recliners (extremely fancy), my son eventually was bored (what?) and played on his phone(!), my daughter had over 30 (yes, 30) small conversations with me before we were halfway through, I cried at least 6 times. The movie is overwhelming for me. See [[Film: Exploration]].

My wife parked the car within 1 inch of the garage door (just barely over the edge), as Dev's car was still in the spot (we're gonna need to find an option...maybe the house that is unused would work?). We came home, and bro + Dev were downstairs. Offspring and I shot the shit upstairs in my daughter's room. More thinking about the movie, of course. They still had some writing to do. We all do.
