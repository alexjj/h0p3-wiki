title: 2020.10.26 - Prompted Introspection: Yet Again

!! Write about a good discovery you have made (big or small).

Why, [[masturbation]], of course!<<ref "a">> To be clear, I discovered something quite small (adequate maybe), but the effect was big for me. I had no one I could speak about it with, at all, unless I was to be damned to hell and ostracized even further. I didn't grow up in a house that celebrated sexuality: no, it was deeply shamed, controlled, gaslit, and so forth. The sexual education we received never even mentioned masturbation. Releasing myself of such a prison has not been easy, [[WINTCIS]]. Porn and the rare biology book (we were taught intelligent design, at best) were my teachers for a long time. 

Eventually, it was explained to us how much of a sin it really was (I was 16, I could drive by then, I had a job, I was 2 years into college). Masturbation has been a symbol and an example used to deconstruct the illusions and delusions of my life; it also spurred plenty of imaginative explorations (y u m). I credit it with providing me some openness, to accepting darkness (and realizing [[ridtyawtr]]),  enabling me to empathize with a wide variety of people, and clarifying for me who my enemies are too. There is dignity to getting off. `/salute` What a surprising teacher!? I [[hope]] to answer Sir Schopenhauer on the matter.

<<footnotes "a" "And, of course, writing about masturbation is also masturbatory. I've decided that every single time I can answer with [[masturbation]], I'm going to. Let's do it! Slurp it up, Lady Melisandre. I adore your questions.">>
