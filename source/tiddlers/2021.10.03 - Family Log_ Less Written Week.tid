* 1uxb0x
** I fixed my sister's computer.
** Thank you for setting up the car (tires and fluid) for me again. Also, I think it's cool that you noticed the different types of tires on the car - it's an odd detail.
** You've had an excellent attitude and approach to taking your public-facing responsibilities seriously. 
** I've enjoyed playing with text editors with you this week. Keep it up, sir! I hope your text editor is something you come to enjoy mastering, and that you'd have a hard time imagining life without.
** I've enjoyed trading music with you. Keep looking for stuff you like! :)

* j3d1h
** I think I'm getting better at getting back to people (in a timely manner, anyway).
** You did a good job helping your dad with the Beast after it broke down. Thank you for being a good helper!
*** You reacted calmly and effectively in what was a relatively stressful situation. Thank you!
**I had fun shopping for art supplies with you. I think you made good choices!
** You did a fine job reasoning about what we needed at Home Depot. You asked good questions. I'm glad we went together.
** Thank you for trying to help me talk to other people.

* k0sh3k
** I did great with Greek. Also with whipping up a policy and training document very quickly.
** Thank you for doing my nails for skintime. I feel like I should collect fleas on my body just so you can pick them out and eat them. Groom me, girl. <3.
** Thanks for helping me pick out art supplies, I would've had no idea what to buy.
** Thank you for having us try out Sunday school, it was worth it to try.

* h0p3
** I'm taking a break. Good on you, loser. I'm glad you listened to her.
** Thank you for the fridge.
**I guess thank you for helping me clean my room too.
** Your artsy friends are pretty cool, thanks for helping me get in contact with them.
** Thank you for giving us breaks from family time on fridays.
