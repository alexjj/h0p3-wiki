title: 2021.03.15 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Letters

[[TTTOTW]]. Tank isn't working because the membrane can't deal with the viscosity. Might have to mix to make it work. Back to Sai. 

Up very late thinking about [[MJos]]'s letter. 

Woke very late, Fireman Time! [[Morning Routine]].<<ref "i">> Hugs'n'bugs. My offspring were underwhelmed with their work. Tasks assigned. 

Shopping @ Aldi. We bought two carts worth of food, TP, and what not. My brother is always walking up to people and telling them how much he loves their hair. It's hilarious. I would get in trouble for it; it would come off too creepy and threatening. Lulz. I ate popcorn and dreamed of sushi. We ended up not going to the W-Entity, and that means I didn't get her eggs, deo, and pie. =/. Tomorrow looks busy.

Oh, almost got into a car accident. Guy gave me the evil eye and fingerguns as he raced around more vehicles. I should be more careful. Fightened my brother.

My wife is feeling very off today. Vitamin D is part of my bet. Her levels are always too low. The weather changes, probably part of it too (my reliable indicator). Held her, tried to find a way to be helpful. She's done everything she can. Her shoulder is extra tight, in pain, but she doesn't want a massage. Motherfuckin' Kevin. I swear to god, this person drives me insane. I hope we aren't be led around here on the timeline. The sooner the better. She was pitiful, though she's still promising to bang me (and, the temptation is as high as it gets). A night of sleep. I hope it works for her. I am slightly reminded of JC here. 

Kitchen/Basement-Pantry organization is being redone. It's slowly growing into what a real chef would want. 

[[TTTOTW]], Vapelyfe, hugs. Too many cooks in the kitchen, but it was a pleasant at the same time. I think that as we age, my wife becomes even more averse to a full kitchen. 

//Wizards// with my offspring and Scout. We gathered around [[monster-16]], and [[MJos]] sent another message to me (dope, btw). Presumably, I do not inspire much [[hope]]. hehe. We talked a lot through it. We really need a couch. Been a while we watched something together.
