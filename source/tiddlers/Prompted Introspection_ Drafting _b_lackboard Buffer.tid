//Paid my trust and objectivity dues, now I'm going to [[change]] how I do it to go with the flow.//

!! What were the 10 biggest things that happened to you this month?








!! In as much detail as possible, capture one favorite memory you've created with your loved ones.

That's not how I tend to remember events with my loves ones. I remember what is bad and wrong with far more clarity and urgency. They weigh more to me in a lot of respects, especially when compared to what I think is most important in the world (which, while related [especially as a generalization of social relations I respect], doesn't tend to include moments with my loved ones).






!! Describe your perfect day---beginning with breakfast and ending with dinner.








!! Write a letter to your teenage self, giving advice and revealing what the future holds.








!! Write a letter to your future self, outlining your expectations for the years to come.








!! List 10 fun things you like to do.








!! What is your most prized possession and how did you come to own it?

My [[monster]] would fit the standard interpretation of the question, and it's a very long story (of which I only know parts). However, possession is something I take seriously. You mean property rights over something material, right? My stake in [[Humanity]] is a moral Hohfeldian rights structure, and I came to own my [[dok]] of it qua being a person, perhaps even just possibly a person, and perhaps qualified in virtue of how I've chosen to exercise my personhood given what I've had in my context.






!! What can you do---as an individual, parent, or community member---to help break a cycle of fear and failure?









!! If you could travel anywhere, where would you go and what would you do?








!! Think back to your childhood when you would visit grandparents or other elders. Capture one specific memory from those visits in the fullest detail possible, including the sights, sounds, and smells.








!! How have those elders left a mark on you?








!! List 10 favorite vegetables and how you like to prepare them.








!! How does nature nourish you?

What is not natural? I submit that even metaphysics count as natural on many definitions we'd be tempted to give. Any time I am nourished, it may be nature that does it. Are you asking me to draw up a list of the ways in which I am nourished? What is nourishment? It almost seems like anything that causes may be said to be dialectically nourishing the consequence in a non-trivial sense. I think your question sucks.

I like green trees, pretty flowers, delicious food, clear water, summer rainstorms, etc. These are important to my health and happiness, though wildly insufficient.






!! How do you celebrate the holidays? What traditions does your family hold dear?

I generally don't care about any holidays, but I do my best to not be a spoilsport for those who are celebrating. Traditions may be different. It depends. I don't care for appealing to tradition as though tradition is the reason something is worthy in almost all cases. There are traditions I hold dear, however, I think that word is quite inclusive. Giving a shit about each other is a tradition to my eyes (and one I hold dear), though I don't think most would consider it the sort of family tradition the question aims to pick out. There are few things in the past that I quasi-worship, and I'm pretty skeptical of exhortations and social pressures to do so (now //that// is a long story).






!! Describe a memorable holiday---whether recently or in the past. Where were you? Who was there? What food was served?








!! When were you last flung into new or uncomfortable terrain? How did this sudden change affect you? What value did it bring to your life?








!! List 5 people who invested in you when you were a child.

Invest need not be a dirty word, but I've some kneejerk to distaste for it. I agree that one can use me as means but not as mere means, and therefore even investment can be toward [[The Telos]] [[irwartfrr]]. As such, I'd like to celebrate here:

* Ms. Terry Gabehart
* ~~Mrs. Graham~~
* Saint Laura Holmes
* Mrs. Melissa Williams
* Ms. Mozel
* Mrs. Carol Mae Cox
* ~~Mrs. Smith~~

...

This list is long. I am a very [[lucky]] human being. I wouldn't even know where to begin. 

These are all from ages 9-12. Unfortunately, I can't recall the names of so many people who invested in me, nor do I even know the [[W5H]] of those [[anon]]s (to me) who did. I wish I knew how to thank those who gave for the right reasons. Thank you.

Of note, it's kinda shocking how few men actually invested anything in me, at all. 




!! Choose one person from the list and describe how his or her support manifested in your accomplishments today.








!! Who was the most influential teacher when you were little? How did this person leave such an impression?








!! What has been your greatest sacrifice?

I [[aim]] to sacrifice my [[4DID]]. I'm a driven person (though some would glance and think I'm a bum). 






!! List 3 people who contribute to your circle of strength. Next to each person's name, describe why he or she is so dependable.

* [[Saint Plato]]
* Saint Jesus
* Saint Kant







!! Create a playlist of 10 songs that you could listen to on repeat.

I've essentially worked on this problem in [[Music: Library]]. Narrowing it down to 10:

‚ñà‚ñì‚ñí‚ñí‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë ''__Awe, Blinding Godsound, Subjugating, The Sublime__''<<ref "ly">> ‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñí‚ñí‚ñì‚ñà

!! Describe a recent conversation you had with someone who did not share your history or perspective. How did you navigate the conversation?

That's all conversations to some [[dok]], and it tends to be quite pronounced. I do my best to avoid most conversations at this point. I step in when I think I am obligated. 






!! What kind of childhood did your parents or grandparents have? How was it different from and similar to your own?








!! List one struggle, one failure, and one success you've encountered in your life. What did you learn from each?








!! Have you spent time in the military, or know someone who has? What does it mean for you to serve your country?








!! How would you describe yourself to someone who does not know you?

It depends. I could just point them at the ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±. I could say nothing. I often dislike trying to figure out what someone else finds [[salient]] about me. I generally have to customize the description for the context. I [[aim]] for my descriptions to be fittingly useful to them and sufficiently fair to me. I think [[h0p3]] does an alright job of giving an elevator speech.

{{h0p3}}





!! Describe a time when patience and rigor contributed to your own self-love and growth.








!! Write about a specific experience when someone dislodged a dream of yours by trying to lower your expectations. How did it make you feel? How did you try to overcome that obstacle? 








!! List 5 ways that person was wrong.








!! When was your last good cry, and how did you feel afterward?








!! How do you look after yourself after you've had a bad day?

It depends on how bad the day was and why it was a bad day. I also have to fight the urge to allow negative aspects of my day to overshadow the positive aspects of it.

The 3(?) week vacation to the West Coast and back. 






!! What would make your neighborhood a better place?

That's an infinitely long list. I'll try to answer the spirit of the question without diving into what that consists in, and save us both some trouble. Better neighbors as better persons, ofc. I live in a rare Red patch of CT. 






!! How do you make the children in your life feel valued?

I do not connect well with humans, and children are no exception. My valuing of a person, the dignity of their personhood and an appreciation for what they've done with it, is often not something they are going to understand. Most have no idea how much energy I sink into trying to socialize [[irwartfrr]]. But, I do think children can know that I do value them. Hundreds have. I look them in the eye and talk to them as a person; we have crossed paths in the desert. Young [[nomad]], how can I serve you? Yes, let us talk about that. Have you considered this? Oh, no, child, you could not be more wrong about that; let us [[wrestle]]. Where are you going? Why? Tell me about your day. Do you know why we are here? Yeah. I hear that. I'll be here tomorrow. 






!! What keeps you up at night?

I can't list them all, for many reasons. I'm often up, doin' philosophy, as I would say. I'm a nightowl, and I don't keep a standard sleep schedule at all. I get to sleep when I do. I've gotten a lot more lately than usual. 






!! How has this year been different from last year?








!! What five things do you want to have accomplished by the end of the month?








!! Close this journal, shut your eyes, and take ten deep breaths. Write down how you feel.

High, cold toes, eyes are dragging from so much debt, work, work ninja, fingers nimble, the [[music]] pushes me through the flow like a deceptively fast-moving stream, the surface does not reveal what lies below, gumpinatin', as you know, the world is shrinking, definitely been depressed lately, isolation and a lack of trust, the desert is real. It always was. I am glad to be here. Indeed. [[I am h0p3]]. May I continue to be so for at least another 13 years. Oh, I feel like doing something other than writing this...






!! Think of a time when you gave away something you loved. What did you give away and why?








!! When was the last time you saw the sunset? What were you doing at the time?








!! What does the idea of "becoming" mean to you?

[[Change]] is real.

I believe local time is sufficiently real for me to think becoming is real as well. Call that a Transcendental Deduction if you must. I take the world I live in to be a possible world, with the past, present, and future all being at least close to equally real. I assume the future is more problematic to any Daseinic perception of ontology. I do not take my immediate, present [[phenomenology]] to have primacy; though it must weigh on me differently. I am not the center of the universe, and neither do I merely move things around on the surface of the planet. I have strong sympathies with presentism, possibilism, and eternalism; but I take the eternal to have primacy, and possibilism secondary, etc. Where ought I {[[Focus]]}? That I never know well enough. Weights and probabilities are sometimes the only guiding force left. 

Obviously, I deny that "all that occurs objectively can be described in science." I admit the roots of analytic have been defeated, like any reasonable metamodern. I am also okay with the claim there [[The Dialetheia]] is central to Becomingness (hard to imagine how to resolve so many [[infinigress]]es as well). We're at place where we must accept absurdity and charge through (at the that one French philosopher got that part right). 

I simple don't know what the idea means to me well enough. I am a process theologist of some kind. I agree that [[The Good]] is greater than [[The Right]], but I know what must consume my compute.
