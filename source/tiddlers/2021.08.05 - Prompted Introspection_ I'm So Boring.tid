title: 2021.08.05 - Prompted Introspection: I'm So Boring

!! How boring are you?

Regarding? To whom? From what perspectives? I don't find my own life boring. It's not that I never experience boredom, but I think it's rarer and weaker in some respects than what most people I encounter experience. I stand in the pocket, stay in the zone, embrace the grind, flit from activity to activity in constant metaframing, and [[masturbate]] a lot. That can be boring to many [[other]] people though. If you don't [[share]] my interests, I'm tedious at best. I also try to make myself boring in some contexts; I have to bypass dark-triadic vampires often enough. 

I don't know how to gauge the [[dok]] to which I'm boring to people. I think I'm probably more crazy, absurd, retarded, or useless to them, and I become boring to them in virtue of that. What's the point of trying to engage me when I'm not low-hanging fruit for them? I think I'm boring to lazy and low-empathy people. That's probably worth maintaining as a shield. Almost no one finds me worth their time in the end; it may be fair to say I'm generally boring, in some sense, according to my species.
