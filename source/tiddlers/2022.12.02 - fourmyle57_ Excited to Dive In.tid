title: 2022.12.02 - fourmyle57: Excited to Dive In

Thanks for the link. These notes are very interesting, not too schizo ha. Going to take me some time to work through this and get up to speed. I need to play with dark web stuff a bit and read. I am also currently working through "Coding the Matrix" to finally learn linear algebra. I hate not really knowing how cryptography works fully and trying to change that. 

I am fairly strong in distributed systems and networking from my day job.. Hoping to contribute the most there. 

From my first pass at the notes, could wireguard be a good base to build on for the edge layer? I'm imagining we could build VLANs entirely with wireguard and it could be made seamless to the user.  

I used to do some mobile dev early in my career.  The problem will be the phone can't use the radio 24/7. Mobile to Outopos will need to use some sort of message passing.  Not sure push messages will be private enough. That will be the hard part. 

Fascinating stuff. Excited to dive into this.  Think this is the kind of project I have been looking for.

Can I post on the site with comments etc? Not sure what's appropriate.

Protonmail is probably fine while I ramp up, but do you have preferred real time comms?
