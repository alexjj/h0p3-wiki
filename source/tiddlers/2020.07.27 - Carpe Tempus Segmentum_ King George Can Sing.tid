title: 2020.07.27 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: King George Can Sing

* Woke at 11:30
** to the sound of my wife attempting to convince my offspring to give a shit about their schoolwork. 
*** As much as I am grateful that she gets to see their choices here (relieves me of a great deal of pressure), I'm also ready for her to not have to deal with it. Whether they sink or swim at this point isn't up to her; she has met her obligations to them.
** Also, feels like I'm missing 1-2 cycles. Ugh.
* [[Morning Routine]]
** Fireman Time! x2 
* //The Coming War on China//
** Poorly argued. I think we are already at war though; it's simply difficult to define war in a way that most people will appreciate.
* Discussion of further restrictions. I will go for the custom [[Whitelist Machines]]. 
** I'm going to need to head down some rabbitholes to lock my daughter out at this point.
** Correct answer might be moving completely offline and just pushing siterips.
** They are paying for it now. 
* Read+Write+Walk+Talk
* The Walk
** Met Alex, the audiophile photographer on the way back to his home. Same spot. 
** I know the distance is even longer, but it felt so short today. 
** Tried to avoid work, talked about our offspring a good bit. 
** My initial strategy of going for high amounts of RAM so they can engage in the same kind of work I do on [[m16]] was overridden by her idea to try 2-in-1. I've tried some Surfaces before, but I find touchscreens to be something I use only when I have to (though we often put fingerprints on my screen while pointing). 
** A few miles a day seems to do well for us.
* Messaged Alex. He asked for more information, so I gave it. 
** `/wave`
* [[Family Gathering]]
** //Hamilton//, A1
** It's that Alfie feller. 
** Very pretty, and I enjoyed when the king sang. It was hilarious.

* Fireman Time!
* Sleep by 3:30
