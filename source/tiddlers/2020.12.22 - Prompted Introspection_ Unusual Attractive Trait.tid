title: 2020.12.22 - Prompted Introspection: Unusual Attractive Trait

!! What unusual trait do you find attractive in a romantic partner?

I'm not sure what you mean by //romantic//, Samwise. Pussy is pussy. If we're talking about significant [[others]] (regardless of benefits), then we're talking about character traits and behaviors that attract me to being around, with, or even regarding them, right? Here's a question I've asked (though not always explicitly or clearly enough) since I was young:<<ref "i">>

<<<
Do they engage in effective philosophical reasoning on a consistent basis?
<<<

That really isn't just for romantic attractions though (even if ideas having sex is sexy). This is fundamental to [[Plato|Saint Plato]]nic^^tm^^ relationships too. Attraction is qua at least some part of [[The Good]].<<ref "b">> All else being equal, I consider any relationship radically incomplete and a failure without this intersubjective pursuit (even if only indirectly or instrumentally in some contexts). Generally, I don't want to be around anyone who doesn't want to do philosophy.<<ref "u">> Hence, I find most adults repulsive. I do, of course, find [[salient]] competence attractive: "effective" and "consistent" for whom? It takes many kinds, with varying abilities, and so forth. Not all fit me, and I don't know what is fitting well enough (I wish to be open). I've met people with Down's Syndrome who were fittingly curious, and I don't find them draining to be around; however, asymmetry means our wrestling is limited. At the end of the day, I want to openly wrestle full-throttle (some things can only be learned inside the real octagon), and it helps if we have some compatibility and [[shared]] reference (or the ability to construct that quickly<<ref "h">>). I should add that I [[aim]] for broad definitions of [[philosophy]] here, one that even the anti-codificationists among the virtue-theorists could admire.<<ref "a">> On that scale, we might be tempted to think that isn't such an unusual trait, but, in my experience, it is.<<ref "n">>

I feel like I've answered with particularism, like I tend to find people attractive who have the unusual trait of being someone that could share mutual attraction with me (though [[uni-directional|FTO Mode: Unidirectional]] is real too).
