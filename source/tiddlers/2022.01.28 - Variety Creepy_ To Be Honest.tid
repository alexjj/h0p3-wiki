>I won't claim it's impossible. I think it is quite likely if one aims to do so. What makes a person worth avoiding?

Just a general disgust. A have a lot of history and just thinking about them makes me go ugh

>Seems dope AF, homie. Those are excellent topics. I think your brother would like my uncle Charlie, and maybe we would get along too. I could imagine you'd have a lot of shop to talk with your bro.

Maybe he would.

>That must be painful. I know it's not easy going so long without seeing those we love. Will you be working to regularly communicate with him remotely? I assume he's going to be insanely busy, but I hope he'll appreciate the effort you put into the relationship with him. There are very few people who know our stories as well as our brothers.

Not that painful. I will be joining him in 4 years. I hope we could meet when I'm in the US. Yes, I will be communicating with him regularly.

Mostly we would do a family Zoom call or a FaceTime everyday or something like that

>That's a significant topic. In terms of electrical engineering, some of the most crucial chip fab monopolies in the world aren't in the US and are largely owned by non-US citizens. What are your thoughts on China?

The chip-fab monopolies may not be owned by US citizens, but their monopoly is just manufacturing those chips and supplying them. Their only scope in that field is to take the orders from companies that require chips, manufacture them and deliver. They aren't doing much R&D either.

My thoughts on China are that it has already beaten the US in many aspects. I'm just saying this based on the stuff they keep releasing. But China also cannot be trusted, so I don't know whether they are using lying as a scare tactic or actually have surpassed the US technologically. Also, China is known for its secrecy. Who knows what the reality is and what technology they have. Whatever they have, they sure as hell don't want to share it with anyone. Especially Indians and Americans.

>Yes, sir. Me too. Just remember that almost nobody knows how to write requirements correctly: that's the engineer's real semi-hidden job, even if none of the paperwork and none of the project managers would ever agree to that. Mastery of that problem with good connections to a place like SV might take you far.

I totally agree.

>How often have you gotten to travel by night train? It's an interesting experience, imho.

Multiple times. Mostly when I was a toddler, but not so much these days. The last time I travelled in a night train was in 10th grade. India has a nice railway system. It's the world's biggest employer and many people use it. These days, time is short and aeroplanes have replaced the trains. People want to save time. But I have to admit, trains are still fascinating and I prefer them over aeroplanes. The night trains are nice.

Many people are there to provide food. Nice options, sometimes. The compartment has a nice and cushiony seat on which we would have to sleep. They give you a nice blanket and a pillow or you would have to carry them depending on the class of ticket you have chosen. It's nice, to be honest.

>I'd say I'm fairly cautious about where I use my names. Everywhere is too strong a claim for my taste. It's a fine question though!

> I lurked from the beginning of that site (and 4chan too). Eventually, I made an account. It's the one I made. It predates the existence of my h0p3ful self-naming. I see no reason to change it. I'm still a 4eak, no doubt.

That's really interesting. I'm glad you told me.

>I recall living in Thailand, population density was so high and labor was so cheap that, in some respects, it was rarely worth my own time during the day to prepare my own food. It was quite a privilege I will never forget. Perhaps I share some of your mother's opinions (though, I do not mean to berate). What do you enjoy preparing for yourself and others?

I think you've got it wrong. It's the other way around. I don't like cooking for myself or I downloaded the app to get to know the days when I shouldn't eat meat when I eating at a restaurant or in the college cafeteria. My mum is the one who doesn't want me to eat out because it's unhealthy in the long run and according to her, eating too much meat isn't good either.

>I don't see why it wouldn't be nice. Also, I make a distinction between nice and kind. That may be valuable here.

Well it was really kind of you to offer and it really was a nice gesture. I don't use things that belong to others unless it's absolutely important like a do or die situation. I think I can be trying out other VPNs and if they don't work, I will think of using yours. Let's see.
