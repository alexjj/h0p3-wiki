title: 2021.09.06 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: A Couch

<<<
Cleaning. Footbath + Wine + [[TTTOTW]]. Been thinking about deeper grafting. I don't have much, and I don't think what I can find is all that valuable. Who cares about what I had to say about [[MTG]] cards? I barely do, except that I have fond memories and it provides some context. It was for pleasure.

LCK Regionals. I'm trying to think of some very clever racist (I will never be talented enough) thing to say about the amazing Korean players I'm watching (may you dine on all the genitalia tonight, bros).<<ref "b">> I predict that China and Korea will destroy most of the retards from all other regions (so brave a prediction). You should see their magic though. It's ace, major, extra, fire, dope, etc., and so forth, and so on. They might be gods. Taiwan, please be careful. This is just a game; who knows what that CCCP<<ref "c">> damage look like, yo. (and whatever curtain is being drawn doesn't look so great for many nations, I regret to admit). 

Have I mentioned that I'm drunk? Two quesadillas, 5 Kirkland water bottles mostly filled with wine (it's a very special kind from a very special box, I think it might be a white wine of some kind, very yummy). God rest my fucking liver. I'm sorry, you poor bastard. Apparently, it psyches me up enough to do my [[Link Log]]...which, imho, requires substances to survive (assuming you are intelligent enough). Even my own wife doesn't look at the nasty hard parts (and, she knows the awful truth well enough already). I have a dark hand.<<ref "n">>

Oh, /r/TopExpert5455 is every bit as paranoid-retarded as I am. Look at that 24h shreddit. `/wave`. You have my attention, sir. I was constructing my response in buffer for you (an uncommon occurrence). Even [[benhylau]] has changed accounts, so I don't mind so much. I [[like]] that you know it's that serious. You know hao 2 reach me, if you ever feel compelled.

Found out she got a raise twice adjusted for being [[Leet]] rated. That shit adds up. 

[[Family Time]]. [[TTP]] discussions and dialectures. My son's arguments about [[Dune]] boiled over into a discussion (surprised my daughter wasn't so interested in it). Offered the same deal to my son, in case he wants out as well. My daughter did end up reading some of my work anyway. Who could pass up that many juicy maymays and [[vidya]]s, after all? Today wasn't fast for my wife; she had a lot to digest. I think my favorite part of hearing about my son's friend, Peter.

We had an interesting Bob meltdown. Ended up rolling back to a daily backup. I think working remotely has some limitations. My daughter was quick to pick the fix.

Made a veggie medley thing for my wife. Gave the rest of my dark chocolate to my offspring. It was a pleasant evening.

By 8:30, we went down to watch //Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan//. My wife continues to flesh out the details. My headache and my eye pain were too much, so I dozed instead.
<<<

Woke at 1:30. Meditation. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Cleaning. [[Morning Routine]]. Footbath + Watermelon + Noodles + LCK Regionals<<ref "l">> + [[TTTOTW]]. Sleep by 7?

Woke at noonish. [[TTTOTW]]. Hugs'n'bugs. My wife is distraught with our offspring.<<ref "s">> 

//Project Runway//. Unconventional materials challenge, the real test. ;P. Yet again, production and the judges are shockingly wrong. That's gotta be one the lessons of the show. //Inform the Men!// Shower of the gods!

//The Walk// with my offspring. It was a rocky start for my son. They did their work, but only after having been hassled for it. My primary argument was the value of sustained work in mathematics (a tired argument I will continue to make until it is not fitting to make it). My wife's standard is purposely as low as it gets for them (concentrated effort, my estimation is 45 minutes to complete her tasks at a level that she would accept [obviously, she would prefer vastly more]). It got better though. My daughter's critical language book chapter was on rhetoric. No better topic to get me to act a fool. By the end, people were happy and joking. 

Vapelyfe. [[TTTOTW]]. Scott the Possible Bootlicker was generous with his dollies. We were speaking with his daughter who is learning to ride her bike, and she asked if we were going to skate with our ripsticks. I explained that we were going to move an abandoned couch from the curb. The girl clearly has lots of practice with authority figures, so it was easy to hold a conversation with her. Scott overheard and lent us the correct tools (he's right, we will have to pick up some eventually, as neither our ripsticks nor our handtrucks were fitting). My offspring hate physically struggling, and this was yet another opportunity to provide motivational reasons to kick ass in school (I shall be the most hated broken record of all time with them).<<ref "ia">> Maybe tooling is a place that we can talk about (as usual, I have very little I can speak about with Scott - until I have evidence otherwise, he still may be a danger). We now are a proud owner of a couch that sits in our garage (my wife is worried about lice again), and I eventually, it will line part of [[The Den]]geon (I need to find a surface for her, next to her chair, when we do).

Shopping @ W-Entity con mi amor. We grabbed caulking to seal both leaky spots and a tub of gel drain clog remover (so that next time I'll have it in addition to our tooling, as [[5c0ut]] and the females push our bathroom drains to the limit, even with catches). Minimalist shopping just to make it an easy week. Big shopping on Saturday, perhaps. Despite my argument against supply chain reasons as the primary cause of inflation, it is clear that supply chain problems are still alive and kicking. I've been a "loyal" customer<<ref "cu">> of this chain for decades, and I can't say I've seen their inventories consistently disrupted over sustained periods of time like this (and, like Amazon, the heart of their competitive advantage is logistics to middleman between vendors and consumers). 

The offspring and I made dinner. My daughter was speaking with me, only partially joking, that one of the reasons she's so depressed is that she's grown up knowing what it means to face capitalism. [[TTTOTW]].

[[Family Gathering]] was dope. We had pizza rolls (turns out the W-Entity generics, this time around, are among the best I've ever had) with tater tots, watermelon, pickles, and water. Junk it up. It was delicious white trash food. //House//. A tough episode, the one in which we learn of Watson's [[homeless brother|5c0ut]]. //Skintime//. I'm like an octopus swallowing and squeezing her. 

Sleep by 9:30.
