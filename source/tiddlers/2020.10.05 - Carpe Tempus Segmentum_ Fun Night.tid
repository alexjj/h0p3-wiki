title: 2020.10.05 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Fun Night

Been thinking a lot about [[Tapeda]]'s messages. I'm not used to someone speaking like [[Tapeda]] does with me. I do my best not to argue with or about poetry (though, of course, I cannot help myself). Rapidfire, loose, and I hesitate to pin it down for fear that it would lose something inherent to it that shouldn't be lost (especially because I'm mean AF). I like [[Tapeda]] probably already knows what I'm thinking there. It's the blessing of being the blind [[naked]] one listening to the [[other]] speak.

*** Maybe we'll get the ashes and sackcloth out.
* Cleaning

*** I fucked the beans up, but everything was awesome otherwise.
** //Community//
*** It's so sexually charged that I'm given an opportunity every minute to say or do something similar. 
** A quiet night with no offspring or worries. Dope AF.
** I received a rare "I had a lot of fun tonight, thanks." lol

I can't tell the difference between him on or off the dexamethasone. I wanted to see that rare side-effects turn it up to 11. Looks sick AF to me though, and this is just a few days into it.

Also, [[Antipleonasm Analysis]] is not coming back. Fuck it.
