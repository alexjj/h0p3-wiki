!! Write a paragraph summarizing each person's week given the wikis:

*** My Prompted Introspection for the 17th is hard to understand but an important problem. I don't know my neighbors very well, I remember seeing one with a nerf gun :). I've had a lot of fun online. I got the game, I'll call it disco, working. It's an amazing game. I have also been playing another game, scp secret laboratory.
** j3d1h
*** Your timelines going out of order is still very interesting. You need to clean your wiki more often. Try using h0p3's bob server for cleanup, if it helps. Prompted introspection for the 21st took a dark turn, but it's pretty good. Your titles are absolutely hilarious sometimes, but describe the tiddlers decently.

*** While your spelling and punctuation are not perfect, they have improved quite a bit! Regarding [[2020.05.20 – Antipleonasm Analysis: Well, ignore that.]] - always be careful interpreting Mark Twain; he was snarky as hell, and half or more of what he says is sarcastic. In the quote you chose here, he was making a snarky cultural critique, for instance. When you're doing your TDLs, such as [[2020.05.20 – Carpe Diem: starting up.]], please remember you only have one Mom, so it should be Mom's work, not Moms work. Remember to tell me what style of meditation you use, and what program you're using as a guide.
** h0p3
*** [[1uxb0x]] came back to school without too many hiccups. That is a good sign. He should be trusted with more. He struggled with his computer this week, but it was worth it. He's been playing [[Disco Elysium]] with the family. He cut his dad's hair. He's meeting people on the walking trail; it's kinda becoming his neighborhood here again. He's not happy about how Friday and Saturday played out, but he had a good week (even those days had plenty of fun).

** 1uxb0x
*** My sister has been taking a liking to Disco Elysium. It was smoother for her than it was for me. I don't think you worked on the Science of Well Being. I think you have made a lot of code this week, you still need to make the code for shifting the calendar though. Overall this week, good.
** j3d1h
*** My project-based writing is going much better. It's quite the contrast to 2019. Disco Elysium has been very, very fun so far. I'm glad h0p3 asked us to try it - this could be a great influence on how I RP, even! I should draw more frequently.
** k0sh3k
*** I'm still seeing a lot of empty/redundant tiddlers? Look up Observer Effect; it's a thing. It's quantum. I would like to see you more intentionally filling out the well-being list. I am sad I didn't see notes for Week Six of Science of Well-Being. I hope you remember it well enough for Monday's assignment.
** h0p3
*** [[j3d1h]] did well in school this week, and she picked it back up without skipping a beat. She was the primary developer of the [[Backlinks Button]]; with resistance, she's coming to better understand how to build tools for researching her own research. She's been generous in allowing her brother to shadow her. She's enjoyed [[Disco Elysium]], which seems to be a more rigid version of her RPing. She's been talking to her friends a lot and being more sociable; may that blossom.

** 1uxb0x
*** My mother hurt her leg, which sucks. I will want to forgive that biker, they hit someone, it's not broken, so it's okay. The biker just needs to be more cautius. I'd like more GISH. Thank you for lowering the bar for having a good score.
** j3d1h
*** I'm very glad you make rosaries. It seems fun for you, and you're even making connections through it. I'm sorry you were hit by that biker, and that Ranga keeps bringing in chipmunks. I cannot help either of these things. I love that your prompted introspections seem to be getting more consistent and longer.
** k0sh3k
*** I made a looooooot of rosaries and chaplets this week. No more nice coffee for h0p3! I cannot do a barrel knot to save my life; I think I'll stick to beads. I have a feeling I'm going to be relying on the kids for help with GISH - stupid sprained ankle. I hate having a sprained ankle. 
** h0p3
*** [[k0sh3k]]'s been instrumental in getting our offspring back up on the horse after break; she jumpstarts their day. Her leg injury sucks. =/. She's been pitiful, and I have felt the lack of walking with her. She's hanging in there, and hopefully it will be alright in a week or two. It appears she makes rosaries in the way that Jan from The Office makes mid-life crisis candles. Work seemed easier this week from the outside, for which I am grateful.

** 1uxb0x
*** You haven't posted a link log in a while. if you like disco elysium you might like another game I have on my computer. You need to sleep better. You have been more forgiving this week about our failures. You should get a thing to help you and your link hoards.
** j3d1h
*** I'm quite surprised you like Disco Elysium. While it does have some interesting themes - talking to yourself, law enforcement, etc. - I wouldn't expect you to like such a narrative-based game. The modifications you want in your wiki are incredibly out-there. Who the hell wants half these things, in the way you want them, and asks their daughter of all people?
** k0sh3k
*** I think you did a great job describing 1uxb0x. :) There must have been a lot of thinking/talking going on - there are several blank spots in Wiki Reviews. I looked in vain for Cratylus on your list of philosophers. You're still having trouble normalizing your sleep schedule, aren't you? I HATE THE GIVING TREE! SO!! MUCH!!! I miss our walks, too. I think you had a very intensely thoughtful week; there was a lot of new philosophical structuring going on. 
** h0p3
*** [[h0p3]] got some decent work done in his wiki (with some new projects too), but he didn't complete his [[review]]s. [[BL]] + [[APonting]] both need to be completed. Tabs pile up in his browser windows, and his eyes bleed as he watches the world. School went okay, although he failed more than his students. [[Disco Elysium]] was a [[vidya]] vortex. He's sleeping like he's mildly depressed, but he had a lot of fun this week.
