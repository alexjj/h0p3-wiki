Yeah your fun text is awesome! There's someone I know who you should meet about that.

You're right, having capital / property to start a self-sustaining vertically-integrated colony would be the most robust way to do it, but I think it's also possible to accumulate towards that without having a central meeting place or in-person contact. It would be possible if there were a group of people willing to voluntarily adopt rules about how they would distribute aid so as to remain solvent on the way to accumulating the capital to get a commune or some other longer-term sustainable way of doing it together.

I am not claiming that one requires a significant amount of standard capital to begin such an endeavor. We began while renting our place to live (and, I suggest even those with a mortgage are renting with a better deal). I agree that cooperation can be fully remote, and, indeed, I work quite hard to demonstrate what it means to build [[trust]] over the net, and fully [[anonymized|Anonymous]] at that. Doing it remote requires enormous dedication just to [[PSM]]ing for a foundation, let alone the rest of what is built on top. I suggest that the problem you have with morality is in no small part a problem of the criterion of authority.

>> :D Thank you!!!

> Thank you for one of the most important online communities in my life. I respect your work, sir. `/salute`.

I was 2+ years behind on modmail. I sort of ignored it when they rolled it out because the interface was hard to use.

If your post was removed and you messaged the moderators and didn't receive a response, I am very very sorry and that was not the intention.

I went through modmail and replied to most of them, and also went back through more recent automoderator actions and re-approved a few posts.

I thought other moderators were handling modmail but I am not sure this has been happening for a while. My bad.

We do use the automoderator, so it's supposed to be my job to stay the hand of the overzealous automoderator and redditors reporting posts.

I will try to check modmail frequently now, but please send me a message directly if you want to make sure I see something or see it quicker.

Complain away in this thread, I am listening.

Also, any thoughts on this: Has the alt-right taken over this subreddit or have they just been trying to pretend that's the case to gaslight us? Personally I can't see how it's the case seeing as how the [right doesn't exist](https://www.reddit.com/r/SotSmeme/comments/sh4fde/the_right_doesnt_even_exist_at_all/).

So just a reminder that media criticism and self-examination are associated with the left, not the right, and this is a pretty leftist subreddit overall imo. And if I have to read a bunch of modmail to actively avoid censoring posts, that's what I'll have to do, because censorship sucks, but you all also deserve to be able to veto the total shitposts and low-quality off-topic manic ego-stroking posts.

It's my honor and pleasure, sir. The respect you to pay to persons is something I hold in the highest regard. You let me know if you need something from me. We're not going to give up. Keep going. We are [[lucky]] to have you lead us in the desert.

I agree with all this. I think there are genuine adult people out there who are trying to actually make things better, but they are relatively rare. To count amongst one of these people, one would have to diligently hold on to hope and keep working even when you can't see others working hopefully nearby, right? Otherwise, we would never be able to see these people from a distance and find them, if they only picked up the shovel when another one was nearby. So I think dogged hope is a commitment, a personal commitment to the character of the ones who keep trying, even when there is no encouraging feedback. That very lack of other hopeful voices out in the world means that they are badly needed; even if there is no reason to hope, a hopeful voice does good and creates a reason to hope, and anyone can do it (say hopeful things and act according to hope), even when they don't feel like it, producing this hopeful future. â€‹

It's been a long time since we've talked. I've been walking through your account again. I think we still would have a great deal to say to each [[other]] about [["|https://www.reddit.com/r/sorceryofthespectacle/comments/88orys/this_is_extremely_dangerous/dwmitpb/]]peer-to-peer [[canvassing]] ethics" despite what may be an allergy to [["|https://www.reddit.com/r/sorceryofthespectacle/comments/8aohya/hopeful_updates/dx3bl7k/]]acknowledging duties or rights or other trappings of governance.[["|https://www.reddit.com/r/sorceryofthespectacle/comments/8b1h1f/primer_on_tribal_politics_the_oedipal_complex/dx3fcd0/]] I'm sure we could have plenty to say about [[censorship|https://www.reddit.com/r/sorceryofthespectacle/comments/8aohya/hopeful_updates/dx3i4sf/]] together. I'm surprised that you might continue to use Telegram significantly despite your [[excellent criticism|https://www.reddit.com/r/ideasfortelegram/comments/dhywj3/remove_necessity_to_compromise_your_identity_by/f3vog87/]]. Among the many services you offer to [[Humanity]], I'm especially [[grateful]] that you maintain SoTS, a [[beautiful]] place unlike any other on the web. [[Hope]] is rare to find in the wild. You got it.
