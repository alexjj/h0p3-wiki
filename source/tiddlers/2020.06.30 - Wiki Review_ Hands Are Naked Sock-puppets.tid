title: 2020.06.30 - Wiki Review: Hands Are Naked Sock-puppets

//My daughter claims they are "skinned" sock-puppets instead.//

** The idea of just making my own language sounds even more fun. I think it would be a chance to address the empiricists, to wield what they know to optimize the philosophical argument on a number of fronts.
*** I don't claim I could build a better one either, but I would learn something few people might while engaging in the practice. Maybe there is gold in them thar hills.
*** Anti-language is something I have studied in some places so carefully, but I am woefully ignorant in this sphere.

** I still don't know for this. I say "park it," and see if it comes back.

** After thinking about it, I'm convinced this is not worth my time.

** It would probably have to be offline first. I highly doubt it will ever occur. I still lurkstalkcheck on them every year or so.

** I'm enjoying //ATLA//. It's been far too long. I don't like my copies, but they are reasonable enough. This may have been the last gift from Nickelodeon I'll ever receive.

** I [[hope]] that they both inherit the opportunity to build the most epic exobrains, raised to speak the language and practice it. It's just a {[[dream]]}. Of course, they may decide it was dumb or worse. Not up to me.

** He did it! He is maintaining that record. Good. I'm hoping that when college arrives, assuming he is willing and able to go, I'll be able to help him reason about structuring it for lifelong usage ([[WINTCIS]], ofc).
