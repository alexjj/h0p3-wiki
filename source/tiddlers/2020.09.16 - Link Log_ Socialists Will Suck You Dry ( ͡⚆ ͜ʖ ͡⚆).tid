*** It's a step closer.

*** The Year of the Linux Desktop might eventually come (obviously, I'm bullish on virtualization stacks even in consumer markets). It would be Microsoft that ignites and extinguishes it. W10 continues to look hotter (and I hate that I would even consider my ex).

* Fishy

*** Lmao. No. Something else is happening here. It's Sandvine.

*** That's what it feels like when I'm arguing with Democrats too (just somewhat saner). 
*** I don't agree to the grey-team's claim that politics is the mind-killer. Reason is the only out, even if [[hope]] is short.

*** Extremely pretty

*** I am happy to see the workers closer to owning the means of production. This shit is something I want my taxes to pay for.
