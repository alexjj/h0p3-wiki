[16:21:46] [[ASmith]]: The breaking news to those that are not watching any news, nor reading newspapers on the conflict in EuroAsia today is that Russian President Putin has ordered his Nuclear Forces to high alert. Any thoughts on this?
[19:22:35] [[h0p3]]: [[Unorthodox Savings]] (you're tagged) was made before it happened, and now I'm taking it even more seriously.
[19:23:47] [[h0p3]]: I am concerned that an autocrat has that much power. I don't see the point to going to war beyond fame for him (as, it is possible he is already among the wealthiest people on the planet, if not the*, depending on how you want to guess on dark money here). 
[19:24:05] [[h0p3]]: I don't think he's cornered though, so I'm hoping it's just posturing.
[19:24:22] [[ASmith]]: ok, only about 3-4 min to spare here, but who would think (assuming that aren't insane or a madman) that the West could freeze and steal 640 Billion in Russian National Central Bank funds?
[19:25:04] [[h0p3]]: It's not clear they will be able to fully freeze or steal those assets. 
[19:25:08] [[ASmith]]: previously the Zionists did that to Iraq, Libya, Iran
[19:25:30] [[h0p3]]: I think they can make it so he'll be taxed heavily by those who would deal with him. 
[19:25:43] [[ASmith]]: that's a WW3 move to steal Russias Central Bank National Funds
[19:26:01] [[h0p3]]: That would be non-trivial pressure.
[19:26:33] [[ASmith]]: ah, 300 Billion in yearly exports to Russia going away and that wouldn't bankrupt many, many across Europe?
[19:27:00] [[ASmith]]: no way would European citizens want that, certainly not mercedes benz
[19:27:09] [[h0p3]]: Some could not accept the blow. 
[19:27:22] [[ASmith]]: fuel costs is already 300% more and this move would double that quickly
[19:27:34] [[ASmith]]: that means 6x more than last year, imagine that
[19:28:11] [[h0p3]]: There is a non-trivial possibility this will continue to escalate beyond proxy warfare and sanctions. I have no guess on the likelihood.
[19:28:22] [[ASmith]]: Eu Parliment looks like its been ZOG's, Zionist Occupied and that translates to steering European Nations into a WW3 abyss despite EU citizens totally rejecting that
[19:28:54] [[ASmith]]: there's far more redlines to ignite regional, global wars now than I've seen in the past 69 years
[19:29:18] [[ASmith]]: people watching the dirt at their feet and living paycheck to paycheck are in for a shock
[19:29:44] [[ASmith]]: anyway, I've been warning of this for sometime so no sense in noticing now... ;)
[19:30:31] [[ASmith]]: ok, I'm up against my time to run some chores then prep dinner here
[19:30:32] [[h0p3]]:  I can imagine you've had a lot of wires tripped lately.
[19:30:37] [[h0p3]]: `/salute`. Yes, sir.
[19:30:51] [[ASmith]]: cya, be safe
[19:30:54] [[ASmith]]: u2
