>> I suppose it depends on the project. Perhaps you are only speaking about this one particular. Dogfooding doesn't seem valuable if development is halted (and perhaps dead, but I [[hope]] not). I'm not advocating for [[Session|2021.09.25 - Computer Musings: Session Fucked]] here, but there's plenty of reasons to use it or other tooling. [[Anonymity]], [[privacy]], real-time chat (sometimes this network is quite slow), a lack of control over presentations of more complex sets of documents, perhaps lower-friction in getting others to join or use a different tool (ironically), and, finally, ephemerality eliminates some of the value we might prefer in highly constructive, accountable, or informative conversations.
