[[Tagging Theory]]: Dynamically render sub-directories given selected tags. `/foo/bar` contains the intersection of foo and bar tags. If another sub-directory exists underneath, e.g. `/foo/bar/example`, it's because one of the files in the intersection between `foo` and `bar` is also tagged `example`.

It's pretty god damn easy to trigger my [[Gradual]]ization. Most don't even consider what counts as defection (and, that too is part of defection: evil is often merely indifference).

Chesterton's Fence still butts up against the problem of justification like all the rest. What does it mean to know the state of affairs before we would attempt to reform? To some non-trivial [[dok]], it is only through the dialectics of reformation that we can even come to know what was unknown about the previous state of affairs.

[[ITS]], the universe and everything in it (into all modalities) are tagged. Not only are we tags with passwords, but perhaps all things are to some [[dok]].
