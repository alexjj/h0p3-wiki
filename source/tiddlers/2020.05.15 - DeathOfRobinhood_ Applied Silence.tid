Humm.. What's your interest in that book? Pedagogy?
May 13 6:42pm
I stumbled across it while looking up some quotes. I kept finding more in it that was interesting.
May 13 7:31pm
Cool. While I appreciate the aesthetic utility of quietness, I'm curious as to what its conscious application into a life (disposition? practice?) would look like? I'd be inclined to rhyme it with humility. Not emptiness. Unlike a vacuum, I do not think it would be prone to drawing attention to itself. Maybe it's a space left open for potential, in which case a silence, to be useful, would need to be accompanied by an appropriate key.
May 13 9:48pm
Was that coherent?
Also, we met with Selah's brother and he taught us both to play mtg. I had a neat loop going cycling between engulf the shore and this scavenge treasure card that let me take out a used instant from my graveyard. It was fun.
May 13 9:50pm
Oh, the key is necessary to discern the right notes, because not all actions are equal and a worthy silence would only be inviting to righteous deeds.
May 13 9:51pm

I do not know the answer to your question. It's one I need to think more about. Your answer seems very reasonable to me. It's a wide open space.
May 15 8:03am
MTG is a wonderland of interactions. I like to think its chess+poker, but with 10,000 different pieces.
May 15 8:09am
I don't think I've found a game quite like it again.
May 15 8:09am
You having a good week?
May 15 8:10am
Yesterday was wonderful. It was warm so Selah and I took a long field trip of a walk right in the middle of the day.
May 15 8:31am
Then she made grape pie
May 15 8:31am
I've only had it once before. Shortly after my dad died an acquaintance made it for me and my mom and I never forgot how delightful it was
May 15 8:33am

I've never had one before. Never even heard of grape pie.
May 15 8:34am
That sounds good though.
May 15 8:34am
I think it's an old person thing
May 15 8:35am
It was made by the wife of an old librarian I know
May 15 8:35am
Their son is deeply introverted. Really passionate about the Celts he is.
May 15 8:36am
The librarian is a guy I like to talk to. He takes forever to formulate his thoughts, but we have discussions subject and flavour quite unlike I have with anyone else
May 15 8:37am
What's been your experience this week?
May 15 8:38am
I bet he's seen some things as a librarian, lol.
May 15 8:40am
Celtic culture was a mystical peripheral thing for me growing up (not that I know anything about it). Runs in the family.
May 15 8:41am
My week has been okay. No school, sleep schedule has been even more out of whack. Chill though.
May 15 8:41am
Have you been dreaming / remembering?
May 15 8:55am
I have been dreaming. I've had long stretches of sleep I've not had in many months. I can't remember anything except that the dreams were chaos.
May 15 9:00am
My motor and sensory strip area has been on pressure-fire a couple times when I wake up.
May 15 9:02am
Chaos. Movement.
May 15 9:18am
Aye. I assume that whatever phenomenology was being simulated was extra taxing.
May 15 9:19am
I don't have strong opinions as to what your dream life could suggest. But I hope your brain can do whatever nightly filing it needs to without subjecting you to unnecessary distress.
May 15 9:21am
My closed-eye hallucinations right before sleep, where I still feel like I've got a waking awareness of what I'm seeing, have been stronger lately too. I have no idea what it means. I'm grateful to have had such long stretches of sleep though.
May 15 9:22am
Nothing ever comes close to what it was like to sleep as a child. Real abandon, feeling totally refreshed, wide-eyed.
May 15 9:24am
On the subject of applied silence... Do you fast?
May 15 9:24am
I have before. I've not in a while. It also arises naturally in some of my manic states where it just didn't register that I needed to eat.
May 15 9:26am
Think I should take it up again?
May 15 9:26am
Depends what your aim is. I wouldn't just suggest it for the sake of 'wellness'.
May 15 9:28am
It's not be my place to say, but it may be your mind that's in greater need to digest
May 15 9:29am
Anyway, I'm gonna go stare at a screen for eight hours to give kids a few minutes of reprieve from thinking about death.
May 15 9:30am
Up to chat anytime of course
May 15 9:31am
lmao, `/salute`
