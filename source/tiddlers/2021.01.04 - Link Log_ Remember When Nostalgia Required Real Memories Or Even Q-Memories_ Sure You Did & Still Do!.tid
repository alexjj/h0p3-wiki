*** There's a non-trivial possibility that even 50% will be printed by the end of 2021. They are only more aggressive than ever about this. The effects should be profound even if they take years to hit. I don't know enough about the relationship between consumer inflation and inflation in the vehicles of capitalism; it can't be zero. Dollar should continue to weaken, right? Where to find growth? Seems like China still.

*** Not that the US doesn't have a fuckton of ground to make up, nor can it make up for its evil. Seems like an odd time too. The continuation of the cold war seems a fair claim.

*** DNC/Neolibs are going to run the IdPol diversion play. It is only the appearance of giving a fuck about persons.

*** Plenty of great moves in here. Authoritarianism is the problem: capitalist control. They still need ICU beds to be open, and they still have to tell a story that is semi-believable. Many have already died from simple greed. The answer required redistribution at the very least, obviously.
