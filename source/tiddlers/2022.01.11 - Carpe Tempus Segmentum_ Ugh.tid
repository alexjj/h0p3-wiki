title: 2022.01.11 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Ugh

[[TTTOTW]]. SC2. Tried sleeping at 3. Don't think I did. Stomach turned, sweats, rumination. 

//Skintime// with [[ASK]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Offspring appeared on task and had divided up the tool chain. He's working on the RSS front piece, and she the magnet link resolver. Her room is a wreck. They began cleaning it. I started on living room and kitchen. Laundry. Trash and recycling. [[k0sh3k]]'s room. Prep for dinner. Basement organization.

[[TTTOTW]]. Ranga has puked twice today. =/.

[[JRE]] called me to make sure he was safe in traffic (good). Doctor's visit for both his offspring, ear infections that only the doctor could find. Antibiotics and perhaps more. We'll see. [[Rb]] dropped from her program as it was revealed that working the MRI machine required years more than they said it would (and the school outright sucked). She's relieved, in part, because working at home on anything while taking care of kids is damned hard. My brother says that for the first time (in ~8 years, IIRC), he is starting to see the "frayed edges" of her. She never snaps and breaks, but she is now. My brother does well to cede [[power]] over the household to her. [[Q]] is biting and learning about the corner. The boys have been tearing parts of the house up, as they do. Asked about [[1uxb0x]]'s acne. Giving $ to [[5c0ut]], hiding poverty from the bosses. We thought a lot about [[5c0ut]]'s year and stories. Asked me about the curl-up and [[Reply Mode]]. Job is cold AF at night, but at least it won't be hot AF in the summer. He's disheartened that he's put substantial effort into compiling and distributing ideas for the union and people won't even bother to read it. `/nod`. Also, again, his co-workers have recommended a bucket to shit in (they all piss in public, nature of the job) emergencies, but I think wet wipes are more important (easy to find places to shit, not easy to clean the peanut butter off our hairy asses).

[[TTTOTW]]. 

Sous chef to [[ASK]]. We used up the leftovers and made focaccia, planned a bit future dinners. She is filled with practical and theoretical information about baking. A peasant gastronomist. 

[[Family Gathering]] sans [[k0sh3k]]. Considered ranged voting, narrowed down to animation, and //Aggretsuko// is what we're going for. New season anyway. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Pushing hard. I've only have 2.2k browser tabs left to go. 

//The Walk// with [[ASK]]. 5 degrees out. Took just the short U (15 minutes at most), and I had ice forming on my face and inside my nose; my glasses had a thick layer of frost.
