title: 2022.07.08 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: My peeps

[[TTTOTW]]. Sleep by 2:30.

Woke at 6:15. Power flickering in the house, my UPS beeping at me over and over. Mi amor is up. Okay sleep, but her head is still hurting. I eventually tried to fall asleep again, but no go. Stump the Gump. Rumination. Fireman Time!

A wild [[user3]] appears...

[[TTTOTW]].

Practiced tattooing + //Ender's Shadow// @D4T09:00:00 with my sympaticon. Leftover brat casserole. First time for both of us, and I think we did alright. I hate to say it, but my results are worse than I thought they would be. I have a very long way to go to get it to look crisp. Getting bright, clean, thin lines in poke and stick isn't easy. I can't seem to stretch the practice material as well as I can skin, so maybe there is some [[hope]] there. I'm also glad we are going for the black light stuff, as it gives us chances to make mistakes that aren't //as// costly. We're going to continue to hunt for authoritative information on this. I can see why the gun is better. This also doesn't remind me of welding as much as I thought it might. Son talked with me about steadying our hands.

Offspring came down to grind. Slow progress, but it's non-zero, and they are engaged.

//The Walk// with mi amor. She's having an allergic reaction to something, and we don't know what. Minor change to her breathing, affecting her esophagus and stomach significantly though. Headache too. She's been solving problems meant for a director, handling some workload for SZ, dealing with security and M's vindictive attempt to slip books back into circulation (gonna fail the report, and she should know better). 

Son chilled with me a bit. He has been avoiding gaming and trying to gamify math instead. `/thumbs-up`. He's got a letter he's writing on the mind. Says our relationship and perception of me is fluid, and that makes the letter difficult to write. `/nod`. 

Leftover tom yum and cowpot.<<ref "s">> //Skintime// + //Party Down// with my sympaticon.

[[D2]] + //Ender's Shadow// @D5T12:03:45 with my sympaticon. Put mi amor to bed. Put my sympaticon to bed. I really do identify with Bean a fuckton, and it's been a long time since I've read it. There are some lines that pop out since I've started writing this ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±, more commonalities (though some key differences too*).

Art group. Vapelyfe. [[dziggetai]] showing us some pretty dope black'n'white fractals. Sportsball commentary. Dane, sportball value creation, redundancy, what makes something valuable? Discourse, habituation, training, spaced repetition, iterative exploration, [[wrestling]]. Autism puzzle pieces. Oreos. Cluster of [[bias]]es surrounding noticing things already primed in memory or repeated often. Syncope and not knowing what the abbreviation "vs." stands for. A sense of [[hope]]lessness and [[power]]lessness over recent shootings. Infinite depth or perimeter measurement of self-similar fractal shapes, excessive dimension. Hunting for software. [[The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum]] on the brain. A runic, densely waved, semi-stochastic sun tribal mondala turned layered graffiti pattern.
