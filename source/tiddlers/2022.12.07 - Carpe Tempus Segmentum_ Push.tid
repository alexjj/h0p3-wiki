title: 2022.12.07 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Push

Woke at 2:30. Gumpination. Meditation. //Skintime// with my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]]. [[DarkMX]] up and running again, and the rare encounter with Kevin Hearn (my post was modified on the site, and I can see reasons for that). Checkin with [[Ignota]]. Thought about [[DarkMX]] with my sympaticon. Brix. Quesadillas. [[TTTOTW]] + //The Fog of War// (made it a bit over halfway).

Mi amor is up. 8D9 + Clarinet + Coffee. Made enough for [[1uxb0x]] as well. Got all the time and skish I could, as that was basically all the physical time I would have with her today (and I knew I might not be awake on her way back). Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

Made plans to visit the housing authority. Sammich + //Skintime// + //Ocean's Eleven// with my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]].

The offspring came down to grind. Read and talked about [[this|https://www.palladiummag.com/2022/11/04/i-do-not-want-to-be-an-internet-person/]]. Proxy SMS to Ginevra Davis. It's rare that I find those in the for-profit publishing industry will speak with me about their work, ofc. They programmed, I [[TTTOTW]]. Exploring [[Herr 亚当]], then the [[yvyfyf]] encounter with GPT-3, which had no major predictions for their parts of the discussion (eliminating line by line).

Read mi amor's sermon. Also used GPT-3 to reason about it (ended up being not useful at all, imho). It's not an easy one to construct an antipleonasmic argument for, imho.

[[TTTOTW]]. Sleep by unknown time, maybe 6?

[[Family Gathering]] sans [[k0sh3k]] at 7? Pork chops, a cheesy pasta, and green beans. I smashed them. I've a French copy of Babel, no good. //The Venture Bros.// S01E00 (been a long time since my offspring really examined). I fell asleep-ish. Mi amor called. Barely awake. Her day was hardcore, and she was barely awake too. Hugs'n'bugs. Sleep by 9?
