title: 2021.10.07 - Prompted Introspection: So Judgy

!! What is a group or community you are judged for being a member of?

What is judgment? I am convinced Dasein is constantly judging the value of everything and especially anything in their ray of intentional (however poorly). As usual, the way people wield word "judge" reveals their judgment non-trivially to me. Most are ignorant, at best, and those above the age of 25, tend to simply be evil in the matter, [[WINTCIS]]. My opening answer to this keeper is this then: we are each members of an enormous number of communities, both recognized by Dasein and otherwise, both consciously and otherwise, and in fact, we are all judgable on all accounts (and there are objective truths to these matter, even if we never access them), and likely judged by any instance of Dasein that recognizes the existence of [[the other]], even within themselves as individuals or corporate bodies.
