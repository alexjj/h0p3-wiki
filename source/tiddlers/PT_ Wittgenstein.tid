; 1889-1951: Wittgenstein

* We cannot even talk about the part of reality beyond our experience - that talk becomes nonsense.
* We can talk about and try to understand the phenomenal world of experience.
* Our understanding of the world is based on language.
* The limits of language define the limits of our conception - what we can understand about the world.
* Language is like a picture, describing reality by having the same logical form with it.
* Language is a multifunctional tool; meaning it is not static, it depends on the context and the function being served.
* Language is a public, social thing, getting its meanings from language-games; there can be no private language.
* Objective truth is not the privileged achievement of any one language-game, such as the natural sciences.
* I have insufficient distance with my sensations to doubt them, so talk of knowledge about sensations makes no sense.
* Our talk of sensations and other mental states is expressive, not descriptive.
* Philosophy has nothing to contribute at the level of empirical problems; they are to be solved by empirical methods.
* Much of philosophy consists of confusions created by a misuse of language.
* The philosopher's job should be to eliminate the conceptual confusions by an analysis of language.
* Our common-sense understanding provides the context within which doubts are possible; scepticism is self-undermining.
