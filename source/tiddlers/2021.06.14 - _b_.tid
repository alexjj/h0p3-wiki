I suggest that we can indirectly shape our hyperbolic discounting, including by practicing identifying with our [[4DID]]s in various respects. Our messy slates are plastic enough that we can radically improve the odds we'll make choices that benefit distant and distant future people too. Choosing integrity in one's identity qua living a {[[Principled|Axioms]]} life can perhaps counteract present-[[bias]] and the myriad of inconsistencies found in choosing to live in the present moment (that itself being a principle to be questioned and altered considerably). There's also evolutionary pressures to become consistent and more accurate in our predictions, as well as lower energy requirements to highly-patterned living, including for principles of discounting. It's a Golden Rule problem.

`/squint`. Is true knowledge qua knowledge of nothing(ness)? Smacks of a dialetheia.

Pre-written. You are written into my art, you are the reason I respect (as ends unto themselves, Saint Aristotle) that places me here and there, [[WINTCIS]]. Leverage me as you need, please. Let's climb it together.

I aim to provide news links that benefit the proletariat. Of course, we face the standard principal-agent moral worries in memetics: you aren't being genuinely represented, you are being marketed to (i.e. represented for the sake of a third-party purchasing your autonomy).

X for the sake of X is the ideology of Y. Surely, but, of course, the only evil is believing that anyone really is evil enough not to merit existence. We intervene.

I adore this realpolitik "bereave in freewilly because its useful" ~~argumentation~~ rhetoric. Sublate, my ninjas. Hope of the Ethers, Gandalf.

Sometimes I'm as good as you know how to make me be. Name me.

Christians who only read Christians are not Christians. But, no education could possibly be complete (as it were, my lads) without having deeply studied Christianity in [[Straussian]] charity, a bias of paranoid positivity. When you seek gold in people, make sure it's not material gold (but rather the transcendent kind). I'd be interested to speak with any expert (self-proclaimed or otherwise) on the topic of the heavens. HMU, push my buttons, let's do it.

I believe in you, into ideality and material entwined all the way down. You help me know when to negate myself. I love the story (as sharing our essence in hope of whatever is emergently justified, qualia-data-driven approach), and mechanics too. The hunt for salient knowledge is always fundamentally a hunt for the knowledge of good and evil. There can be no wisdom or even perceived wisdom without studying it as one's assumption. Always was, and always will be. Amen.
