title: 2021.08.04 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Crawling

Woke at 12:15. Meditation. Cleaning. Sent both offspring to bed. =/. Leftovers. Lightning! [[TTTOTW]] + Footbath. Way into daylight speaking with [[5t3v3]]. Hugs before she left. Atttempted sleep by 8:30

Woke at 2:30? Gay dreams. Meditation. [[TTTOTW]]. [[Morning Routine]].

//The Walk// with my offspring. We had Arizona dranks (it was dope). Lit up for doing nothing. Met Bill (right before inside of the U's curve). Talked about his roof, factory work, wife's funeral job, retired, flexibility, he's interested in becoming an extra in film. Also, we saw 45yo Joe, doing odd jobs, talked to us about an abandoned house, he's been trying to convince his parents to sell (his neighbor's house went for 35k above asking). Didn't talk about much that was deep today. Shootin' the shit really. It got silly. Vapyelyfe. We growled a lot.

//Foundation// @ 4:55:18 - Hardin's story is over. `/tears`. [[TTTOTW]].

She was quite frustrated. With SL on vacay it's been a madhouse of non-stop action, PT fucked up on scheduling (worried about being charged for their mistake), library holds released, closed early. Lots of little things. Held her and walked through the day. She's got 25 130+ IQers with respectable intentions who are historically obsessed with libraries (some of these fuckers even have their own MLIS's already) for 5 positions. She's freaking out because she has to say "no." There aren't bad choices here for her. Shouldn't've skipped lunch. I keep begging for her to maintain her supplies at the office, just in case (but, snack is mood). She keeps turning me down for massages, despite her pain, because she'd rather maintain her hair. Mmhmm. Inform the Men! Meditation. Shower of the gods!

Assignments. [[TTTOTW]]. Took a shit. [[5t3v3]] verified. He's alive. =). She chilled downstairs with me, reading a terrible book that she has already completely predicted but is reading anyhow to prove to herself that she's really smart. We know she's smart. She knows she smart. I don't understand how this is better than sex for her. But it is. I am really bad at it, I guess.<<ref "a">>

[[Family Gathering]] sans [[5c0ut]]. Steak (they did not follow instructions, =/), baked potatoes, gravy (!), sprouts, watermelon, water, dark chocolate. //Arrested Development//. Talked with [[5t3v3]] as we watched. She felt much better, less hangry even, after the meal.

I decided to leave her alone. She need time all by herself. My skin is crawling to leap on her and skish, but no. Bad [[h0p3]]. 

Drug the offspring out to finish the job. I was summarily pushed out of the kitchen by my daughter, as she usually does. 

Tested the car out per her request. Gave it 15 minutes of driving around. I can't say it's worse yet. It might get worse.

<<footnotes "a" "Only copious amounts of alochol can make me that attractive. And, it may be evidence that someone isn't very smart if they've made the huge mistake of doing me. I get it. I have sex with myself not out of self-attraction, but more out of pity than anything else.">>
