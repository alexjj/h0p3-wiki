> I should have known to check the wiki first 

It's where I speak from 99% of the time these days.<<ref "a">> Seems the wisest option at this point.

> I have gone under the knife around March of last year for bariatric surgery. Gastric sleeve. I have lost a confirmed 100lbs - most likely more as it has been months and months since I have weighed myself.

Congratulations, sir. That is excellent. May you outlive us all.

> I have to keep an eye on my oldest as that apple has not fallen far from the tree. She is now as tall as her mother. 

I know that feeling. Pretty similar here. May they all be healthier than we are.

> The freedom of movement improvements alone are marvelous. Much more so fun time in the sack - I have it on good authority from both parties involved.

`/nod`.

[-c°▥°]-c (‿ˠ‿)

Makes perfect sense to me, sir. I'm glad to hear it.

> We have also recently moved into our new home (as of November) and are quite happy. We have been blessed immeasurably. Three bathrooms, up from the single one, in our old home. No more bathroom occupancy issues and pissing in the tub.

XD. 

> The home was/is very much a fixxer upper and the newfound mobility has come in quite handy in trying to make it a home. 

Very cool. Hank Hill territory even.

> the original structure has terrazzo floors throughout. 

I bet that looks good. I like those kinds of floors.

> Coming back to the topic of health we have all had Covid.

[[Hope]]fully, you all didn't have it at the same time. I know that can be [[quite unfun|https://i.redd.it/5d1bqqu3vid81.jpg]]. 

> My brother is married and they are having issues conceiving...They are a couple of DINKs and took the kids to Disney before the 'Vid hit. 

Life is easier without them. I'm sure your own offspring have played a role in their desire.

> The wife, kids, and I lived with my dad for about a month last year as our old house sold well before we could find the house to buy. It was a very scary time. 

I know that feel. A month is doable, thankfully. I could imagine it was surreal even.

> Our grandmother from KY also was there for several weeks during that time. It was "quite" the experience.

How'd your daughters think and feel about it?

> Day to day I have worked at home from the real onset of Covid and the wife is in and out of the pre-school from week to week depending on how their cases of the 'Rona are.

Quite a privilege to be able to work from home. Do you anticipate you will be able to continue that after the pandemic ends (if and when*)?

> Teaching 3 year olds on Zoom is a farce, but one that pays better than expected.

No doubt. That's gotta be pretty heartbreaking. 

> The kids go to the public school

Their peers and teachers are exceptionally [[lucky]] to have them. Has socializing been difficult for them lately or has that smoothed out?

> Hopefully, we have begun to remedy that situation with the assistance of church members who are in the know and have been exposed to the artistic skills of our progeny.

> Also, on the topic of the kids they do read voraciously...

I knew they would. =). I'm elated. It's a blessing to have offspring who like to read so much. I wouldn't be surprised if they branched out on their own into the many worlds of reading, especially since they receive solid encouragement.

> But, it is the crazy year of 2022. And shits just started yo.

Aye. You have any predictions?

> I did get a new case as the old was gunked up so badly and had such poor airflow. I now use a Fractal Meshify C and have a Noctua cooler instead of the default CPU cooler. 

That's a nice case. I'm hoping never to have to seriously clean another case myself. 

> The NVME is on the fritz, or at least that is my current assessment of the situation, so I am running on the old standby of SATA SSD. 

Shit. [[Sorry|https://i.redd.it/jj8raanrhwq51.jpg]]. =/. Nice to have the standby though. `/nod`.

> I did add a video card before the current conflagration an RX 480 I believe. I do not even remember for sure! Can you fathom that?

We're gettin' old. Our memories are getting stripped down. Lol.

> Only here in the very recent past have I come to more and more dislike playing games as they tend to take up my time and have me not do what I should be doing instead. I am not free of that addiction yet - but I am trying.

Not an easy addiction to break. I hear that. Watching people play in the background seems to help with my cravings some.

> My average week is mundane, boring for the most part even, and I am trying to find more meaning. I long for the weekends but they disappear soo quickly.

Yes, sir. There's never enough time. It's not an easy hunt, imho.

> Had a couple from church over this afternoon for lunch. Jop made noodles. The couple is a navy brat American and a Vietnamese lady. They have a 4 month old boy and a few year old girl. They didn't get to stay and visit as long as I had liked. Even so, he is quiet like me and we didn't get beyond the surface pleasantries mostly. This was the first time we had them over.

I can imagine with very young ones they don't have much time or energy. Being able to visit [[other]]s, spending time with adults in particular, might even be rare for them. When do you think you'll see them again?

> In this new home we have so much more room. 

Dope. It's a privilege not to feel packed in like sardines.

> A few weekends ago we had over two families one from church who was a widow with a boy around my kids age and a couple from church/work that has three boys of similar ages to the girls. That was a zoo but was quite fun.

Sounds like a pleasant use of your resources. Do the young ones stay in touch remotely when they can't see each other offline?

> Also, I would very much like to hear your voice again and to catch up. I am sure that would be a day onto itself. I know during these years Jop has asked me why we split up. I don't think I ever had the heart to ask that of myself and always avoided the situation and pushed it from my mind and was similarly curt with her when she would broach the subject. Perhaps, something to try to unravel as she will surely want to be involved in this - but all in due time.

> Also, I have not read all of the footer info in your wiki response so please forgive me that. 

I'm glad to receive your response. I'm sure you'll have a chance to read the [[link]]s and [[footnotes|Footnotes]] later.

> I was trying to resolve an issue with the monster and was waiting for the terminal commands to finish when I stopped by your neck of the woods.

What were you trying to resolve?

> I still run Manjaro Cinnamon btw. I have done some distro hopping but find that I like this distribution and DE the most of all I have tried.

It just werx, bro. I hear that.
