!! What's a superpower would you like to have?

[[2018.06.15 - Prompted Introspection: Superpower]] is accurate enough, and yadda yadda to wish questions, but now I want to have fun with the question. Unfortunately, I don't know how to reason about the implications of a lot of superpowers. Take for instance the ability to translate any language (that might just be metaphysics itself). 

I wish I had the ability to just heal people. That's pure magic right there. It's okay if it wasn't wide-ranging even. I'd like to be a person that made injuries and emergencies not so bad. Plus, I might be able to tranquilize people. Please tell me that getting high counts as healing. That would be dope. `/boop`, ur now high. Congratz. I would be a cool fairy.
