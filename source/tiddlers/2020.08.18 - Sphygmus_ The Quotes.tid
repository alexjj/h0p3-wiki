"""
[2:14 AM] robotic_scarab: can you see if this book is available from your sources? https://books.google.com/books/about/Book_Was_There.html?id=XhWfrh8Ujf4C
[2:32 AM] h0p3: Sadly, only first chapter.
Piper_BookWasThere_2012_WEB.pdf
2.20 MB
[2:33 AM] robotic_scarab: arr sad, thank you for this bit though :agreement:
[6:53 PM] h0p3: Those are some fascinating quotes!

[11:41 AM] robotic_scarab: this is hilarious and wonderful omg

[3:57 PM] h0p3: :smile:
[3:57 PM] h0p3: It was fun.
[3:58 PM] h0p3: Still working my way through the music list you provided. Some [[gem]]s popped out. Thank you.
[4:01 PM] robotic_scarab: I'm glad some have stood out to you! I've definitely only scratched the surface of the list I gathered from that reddit thread
[4:03 PM] h0p3: Also interested to see where you take the nested tabs. I could imagine that growing the sidebar is one of the magical hacks of TW.
[4:03 PM] robotic_scarab: ah yes! an experiment that grew from looking at my server logs, actually
[4:05 PM] robotic_scarab: there appears to be a reader from China, user agent string stays the same and IP is generally from the same region, with a 200 request (so straight to https -> likely typed into browser? though the referrer url is baidu, I think that might just be something their browser app does if I were guessing) and they stop by maybe a couple times a month
[4:06 PM] robotic_scarab: which made me curious what they keep up with, and think about how to surface changes that might be more interesting than just the daily logs
[4:06 PM] robotic_scarab: cause daily logs push the more topical changes down and out of the recents list
[4:07 PM] robotic_scarab: not sure I'm perfectly happy with my solution nor do I know if it's actually something that "every so often" readers would appreciate but, experiment!
[4:08 PM] h0p3: TW makes it fun to experiment. It's high-level enough that it doesn't feel like you have to know requirements in advance.
[4:09 PM] robotic_scarab: (I'm also inclined to think something like your :fire: list would serve a similar purpose.. like, a way to highlight things in a sort of "if you haven't visited in a while, here's what's currently top-of-mind or most interesting to me lately")
[4:14 PM] robotic_scarab:
the nested tabs. I could imagine that growing the sidebar is one of the magical hacks of TW.
definitely an area you've taken further than I have, for sure, with tdls and tmpls and so forth
[4:17 PM] h0p3: Aye, still thinking about what :fire: should be. It's still not where I want it (but I don't really know where I want it). Seems like it serves two purposes for me so far. I wanted [[Family Time]] to be streamlined a bit, and I want to make it so that extended family could just check once a week. I want [[Recent]] things that matter a lot to me, sometimes the older bushes that I'm growing in the garden,  to show up. The problem with [[Recent]] for most people is that it's too damn noisy and big (for me, that's great, and I think for heavy users of TW, that's acceptable); I'm not sure how to cull it well.
[4:20 PM] robotic_scarab: heh, yeah, I agree that Recent can be extremely noisy at times (especially when bulk-editing / tagging / updating...)
[4:21 PM] robotic_scarab: it's basically the only tab I use when reading your wiki, but I'm also.. somewhat diligent about checking every day and still I've gotta like, remember what the last tiddlers I read were, so that I can pick up reading where I left off :P
[4:21 PM] robotic_scarab: ofc wiki reviews are always where I go when I've been away from reading for a month or more
[4:22 PM] robotic_scarab: agree about wanting Recently edited things that are important to show up
[4:22 PM] robotic_scarab: I think all three of us (you, me, chame) feel this, that sometimes it would be nice to have recently edited things in the wiki review
[4:23 PM] h0p3: Like a git commit message.
[4:23 PM] h0p3: It probably has to be picked out by hand.
[4:24 PM] robotic_scarab: yup! altho potentially with a single-use tag as well, now that I think about it
