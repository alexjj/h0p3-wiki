[9:47 AM] h0p3: How's your day going?
[10:17 AM] Ardent_Assailant: Not bad so far. Body is sore from ring fit. Gonna skip it today I think.
[10:17 AM] Ardent_Assailant: How about you? :slight_smile:
[10:27 AM] h0p3: Excellent. Glad you got that sore. Gonna be ripped next I see you.
[10:27 AM] h0p3: I have a lot of work to do, avoiding it as best I can.
[10:38 AM] Ardent_Assailant: haha. I'm just aiming for "healthy" :joy:
[10:38 AM] h0p3: I hear that.
[10:38 AM] Ardent_Assailant: I feel that. How are the chipmunk adventures?
[11:23 AM] h0p3: I am lucky that I don't have to take care of the cats. Not my circus, not my monkeys (or cats, or chipmunks ;P). Chipmunk is still caged in the window area with necessities. Scurries too far to be handled unless we used tongs (ugh, I don't like that).
[11:23 AM] h0p3: It's tiny.
[11:33 AM] Ardent_Assailant: A bat once made its way into my parents' house before. That was an adventure, haha. We are fortunate to have only had a wasp make its way into our apartment before.
[11:34 AM] Ardent_Assailant: I wonder if there's a way you all can put it to sleep without hurting it. :/
[11:34 AM] Ardent_Assailant: Also- I JUST SUBMITTED MY GRAD SCHOOL APPLICATION!
[11:34 AM] h0p3: Yay!!
[11:34 AM] h0p3: Congrats, sir! That is excellent.
[11:34 AM] h0p3: Gonna be a fascinating two years for ya.
[11:35 AM] Ardent_Assailant: I shouldn't have put it off, but I'm still early. The extra time to meditate on the essays will be good (hopefully)
[11:35 AM] Ardent_Assailant: Especially with all the craziness :smile:
[11:35 AM] Ardent_Assailant: I also realized, in putting together a resume within their template, that I probably haven't done enough recent community service, so I had to do some far reaching for that specific field.
[11:36 AM] Ardent_Assailant: When we were in high school, they organized stuff like that all the time
[11:38 AM] h0p3: Makes sense.
[11:38 AM] h0p3: That is something I've been thinking about for [[j3d1h]] and [[1uxb0x]] too.
[11:41 AM] Ardent_Assailant: Part of it is that I'm not really sure where to be connected to things like that, but also I don't want to be part of a glorification project if the organizer is misusing funds, or trying to look good or something like that. It's probably a silly thing to be concerned about now that I'm putting it to words, haha.
[11:41 AM] Ardent_Assailant: Yeah, I bet it would be even harder to be connected to a community service project for them-- being so young.
[11:42 AM] h0p3: I appreciate aiming to not merely virtue signal, and especially to avoid engaging in unjustified deceptive behavior.
[11:43 AM] Ardent_Assailant: For added context, we used to be part of a religious campus organization that ended up becoming really shady. It's the reason why we stopped attending/ being affiliated with them.
[11:43 AM] h0p3: They may be competing with a lot of rich kids who have can afford to effortlessly make themselves look good on applications (and are fine with unjustified deception).
[11:43 AM] Ardent_Assailant: Fuck the rich
[11:43 AM] Ardent_Assailant: :smile:
[11:43 AM] h0p3: :smile:
[11:44 AM] Ardent_Assailant: It's a weird problem though. At the end of the day, is it worth the cost if people who have need see them fulfilled? Probably.
[11:44 AM] Ardent_Assailant: Yes, definitely
[11:45 AM] Ardent_Assailant: I should look into more community service once the virus finishes disposing of most of us lol

[2:47 PM] h0p3: How's it going?
[3:06 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Hey! Pushing through some D&D prep and working out. Made another doctor's appointment to talk more about my health issues too
[3:06 PM] Ardent_Assailant: so I'm kicking ass today :slight_smile:
[3:06 PM] Ardent_Assailant: How are you?
[3:07 PM] h0p3: Noice. Good to kick ass.
[3:07 PM] h0p3: You've been consistently working out. One of the best answers to depression (surprisingly better than SSRIs, etc.).
[3:08 PM] h0p3: I'm not kicking ass yet. Hope to get there. :slight_smile:
[3:08 PM] h0p3: I have a lot of writing to do, and I need to get myself to do it.
[3:09 PM] Ardent_Assailant: I'm thinking about trying wellbutrin since it works a little bit differently. Any experience?
[3:10 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Don't worry, the ass will get kicked haha :smile:
