** Edited. We had fun. My wife didn't care for it. I can appreciate after a day of work that she'd rather just chill. More slideshow presentations is perhaps demoralizing. I'm glad the offspring had the chance though.

** I hope my offspring will take pleasure in such a thing too. I know they have in previous homes, but it would be different for them too. Placeness association, spatial roots for mapping our memories of multiple worlds of thought, and just the fun and safety of it.

** The best powerpoint presentation I've ever presented. 
** It reminds me that I face more rejection than the average person; I agree with [[GClark]]'s excellent schizo-feedback-loop hypothesis. I am like alien in every setting, lol, though I'm lucky enough not experience dissociation from my body in a way that tends to be too negative (as bad as I smell and look, I'm lucky enough to feel comfortable and even happy in my skin in many respects).

** Yup. All I want to think about is laying pipe while surfing the series of tubes. Would be nice to ignore the world further.
