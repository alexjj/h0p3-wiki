title: 2020.12.06 - Family Log: New House

!! Write a paragraph summarizing each person's week:

* [[1uxb0x]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I liked this week more than normal. I need to work more on lifting weights and running. It was notably odd that I had an easier time lifting things in less likeable conditions, like being outside in the cold. There's not much to say about this week for me.
** j3d1h
*** I'm glad you were happy this week. It was eventful, and you did a great job on the move. I guess I should get you more used to RPing soon, and help work out more about your characters! I'm glad that you're helping to think about where things go, like where dishes should be in the kitchen. You don't usually do/enjoy that much.
** k0sh3k
*** Thank you for helping to move us to the new house! I know it wasn't the most fun thing ever, and it was a lot of work, and there's more still to do, but you kept trucking along with a pretty good attitude. You were smart to know when to use the dolly and when to lift things, too.  
** h0p3
*** [[1uxb0x]] had a long week. He helped plan the move, took apart the internals of our old home, packed it up, moved it, and began unpacking at //The Asylum//. He carried his weight and then some this week. He's been honest, and he worked hard with a good attitude. Again and again he was my goto guy for the zillion tasks that needed to be done, big and small. Our landlord was surprised we could move so quickly; we couldn't have done it without him. A week without much of his computer seemed to do him some good, by his own admission. He enjoyed the physical activity, and, as he puts it, he's glad to work on something that doesn't require much skill. We didn't get to do [[h0p3ful Review]], but I'm hoping we will this week (we'll see).

* [[j3d1h]]
** 1uxb0x
*** My sister didn't want to talk as much this week, I would've expected she'd've talk to me more, her being without her devices. She didn't have a great time this week. She doesn't get to talk as much as she wants to with smokey. She met a new friend.
** j3d1h
*** This week wasn't stressful, just kind of all over the place. Physical labour isn't so bad with music, and moving the cats wasn't the worst. Spending time with Ranga is always pretty nice. I talked a bit to Smokey and Pip, as well as making a new friend (JJ is pretty cool). Pretty desperately wanting to draw.
** k0sh3k
*** Thank you for helping to move us to the new house! I know it was frustrating and not your favorite way to spend time, but you worked hard and got a lot of the packing done. You were also extremely helpful with wrangling the cats into the car - thank you! I'm glad you found a new friend to talk to, too; I hope they end up being a good person and a good friend. 
** h0p3
*** [[j3d1h]] has engaged in more physical activity this week than she has in a long time. Her week started off poorly, but it got somewhat better. She seemed happy with the move; once the ball was rolling, she was on board. She felt uneasy not having access to her things (particularly for drawing). The move gelled together with her work, and she was the primary kitchen handler (women's work, ofc [know your role {this is wat god intends}]). Our interactions were imperative, tensely accounted, and serious, but we found some time for to have fun too. She's annoyed that her father never interprets her sarcasm correctly (I just, like, take it too seriously and literally every time). She met an artist who worldbuilds somewhat like she does, and she's excited to see [[j3d1h: Entity]], who may be coming down from his Day-Z binge. 

* [[k0sh3k]]
** 1uxb0x
*** My mother had a lot of things this week, and helped even though it put more pressure on her. Do you never use sarcasm? I haven't heard, nor seen this jar of sparkling liquid from what I know. 
** j3d1h
*** This week wasn't literally the worst for you, which sounds pretty nice. The RCL was great. I didn't really understand all the destruction imagery for a while, but that makes a whole lot of sense. I hope your workplace sorts itself out soon, though I'm glad they're actually acknowledging the whole pandemic situation. Also, yeah, koalas suck.
** k0sh3k
*** This week was pretty crazy, but I did a good job getting the contactless pickup working. I have a workflow down that makes it easy for everyone involved, while keeping the pace high enough to get everyone their items in a timely manner. I finished my management class - //confetti!!//  
** h0p3
*** [[k0sh3k]] has enjoyed Evil in her life, and that is concerning (seems hypocritical given her RCL too). She's had a ridiculous week: fighting over ILL centralization, handling assholes (why not me and mine [spicy], love?), finishing off her first management class (aww yiss), lifting heavy objects, wrangling cats, and being the pants-wearer in the moving process (several times I couldn't be in two places at once, and she handled it). She's been stressed, understandably. We're almost over the hump, and she's going to need that break in two weeks. This week has felt like a microcosm of this year for her. 

* [[h0p3]]
** 1uxb0x
*** Me and my father worked quite a lot this week with eachother. I didn't do any h0p3ful review with you, but that's because A: I didn't have anything, and B: at a part, I had no computers and chargers but a phone. I don't know why you keep thinking it was emotionally tense for me, the only part that was emotionally tense was the packing. 
** j3d1h
*** Living without the internet has been a bit of a pain, and we've barely been here. I'm glad you got a few people to do the packing for us. It would have been hell doing that ourselves. That truck's gas chart sounds really stupid, but I guess I can understand why they wouldn't want the trucks stranded. Also: //shut up about the wiki/s!//
** k0sh3k
*** Thank you for pushing the move so fast! I wouldn't have tried to move so quickly on my own and worried that you were pushing for too much, but you got it done! There are reasons I won't play Minecraft with you anymore, and you know the reasons. I hope you enjoy your basement, troll; maybe one day I'll get you a bridge, instead. 
** h0p3
*** [[h0p3]] is sore, but happy enough. The move was not as smooth as he'd have liked (he screwed up in prepping everyone's personal things for the gap), but it has been livable. May it be the last time he has to move. He's been the taskmaster and workhorse this week. He found time to chill and write some too. It's always surreal to move, but it wasn't traumatic. He's been pressed for time, but there was room for error. It's been a blessing to see the difference in living spaces. //The Asylum// is the nicest place he's ever lived, and it's a pleasant escape to think about how to build his fortress and maximizing his Hiki Dale Gribbility. May our home house many.
