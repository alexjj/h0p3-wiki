I summon the NEETs, The Incels, and The Beatitudinees for council, prease.

Eastern propaganda machines are allowed to operate on Western platforms, but not the other way around. This asymmetry will continue to pay dividends in a world in which every move will be at least partially anticipated, tracked, bought, and sold before it has even happened. 

Word salad, you say? Salad is [[good]] for you pretty often, dumbass.

There is never enough time to be together in a way that feels "truly together" (whatever that means). It must be mediated and prepared for, windows of time. We must endlessly hammer to build heaven on earth.

Why should I think markets are meme-money transducers? For whom? That seems too optimistic. Obviously, we are pumping freshly printed money into perilously complex financial instruments and systems to virtualize liquidity and game monetary metrics. The external pressure is building a bubble of some kind, an illusion, and I don't know the consequences (doesn't seem like anyone does [though my bet is still on some Neo-Marxian prediction]).

We will never escape theories characterized by [[phenomenological]] parameters. Saint Kant is correct about the necessity (and insufficiency) of empiricism. It's our plight. 

I agree that information tends to bias in proximity to power like light curves around massive bodies. 

The anarchist is mistaken in claiming/believing decentralized viral capital-microstates deterritorializing the totalizing state is justified in itself. This was always the case, but whose capital? Whose means of production? Whose [[power]]? [[FTSO]] whom or what? I find most anarchists ultimately deny the reality of justification, quite conveniently. That "the nomad" will attempt to appropriate the state-form, transmute the supposed overcoding essence of the state into a weapon, a virus, with microstates erupting like fungi across the globe, creating islands of striation and walled gardens to impede the action of the total war machine does not imply that they will succeed, let alone that they ought in this manner. Morally justified decentralization is probably the most fundamental problem in [[Justice]], as I see it. Here, the Continentals have failed as well.
