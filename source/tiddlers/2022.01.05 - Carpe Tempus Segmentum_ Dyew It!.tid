title: 2022.01.05 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Dyew It!

Arrived home from //The Walk//. [[TTTOTW]] + those wafers + water + vapelyfe + SC2. 

Dialectic with [[ASK]]. We made food. I had salad and tendies. Finished //China, IL//. [[TTTOTW]]. //Skintime// + //Kushiel's Dart// @ C71:14:00. Sleep by 4?

Woke at 12:30. Amazing sleep. Can't remember my dreams, but I remember the feelings. Mi amor is home! wtf? Dope. There was like a 10 car pile up from the black ice outside our home (they hit the pole too, which makes me a bit sick inside; we have reason to believe, including from our next door neighbor who has owned this house before, that this will continue and that our own vehicles and house will eventually get damaged). Worked just fine remotely (and learned a thing about managing the Voyager account). 

Offspring had not begun the tasks I scheduled with them. =/. ándale, ándale. 

Shopping @ W-Entity with [[ASK]]. Picked up more salt for the sidewalk (most of ours was consumed this morning). De-icer spray for mi amor's purse in case she would get caught out (though, I think I'd rather just chip at it myself). Some missing foodstuffs. ATM. Saw William for a bit. He had no time, and I have no idea how to maintain a conversation with him at this point. He's a Bowie fan. `/nod`. I will be useless to you, probably, sir.

[[5c0ut]] called me up (wasn't able to earlier) for advice. Agreed with him. He's the boss, so he should go with his gut instincts to protect his workers. He can do it quietly and carefully. Not hard to build loyalty from the bottom and eventually trust from the top. Seems to like his boss (not the regional psychopath*). He misses being home. Just a couple more weeks, maybe.

Cleaning up DC++ hubs again. DDNS hubs drop like flies, and I'm not here to join any clubs/crews/guilds/etc., e.g. [Foobar]h0p3. There's a classic federation problem where we are too inclined to join them all. No clean way to deal with PM spam (some hilarious trolls in here crashing clients). Minimalist chatting with soulseekers. I need to continue to curate and organize [[The Library]], as it were. Eventually, I'll have to go for very large drives (still not going VMed passthrough unraid: KISS, as [[Film: Library]] and a well-rounded audiobook library alongside the corpus for [[Links: Library]] will be no joke. VPS seems unavoidable for VPNing/Socks5 proxying, so will look into that tool live C hooks to see if I can proxify those that do not wish to be (I don't fucking get it; seems obvious, but Nir won't handle CGNAT either...which given the centralization isn't hell). Best part is, again, that I've a reasonable opening move on territory that I think is [[salient]] already (and, ofc, I'm happy to give [[anonymous]]ly to [[anon]]s too - the tracking concern is one still worth thinking about); though, I doubt much will come of it (who knows?). Seems like [[Live]] [[chat|Chatlog]] has the highest odds of any serious commitment. Long-term depth is beyond rare. Still considering picking up a 10Gbit seedbox to seed hard AF once more. I can make it sing.

My daughter constructed plastic shims from a broken plastic container, and I had her clean the hardware so I could tighten the nuts connected to the flange (old, dying, and I'm fine [though unhappy] with the the metal dying, but I really don't want to crack the fucking toilet itself), as it's better that I break it than anyone else. She's unhappy, but getting some shit done. 

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. Talking about our days, but eventually, could not stand it. Must fuck, nao. //Inform the Men!// Sweet baby jesus. Meditation. Shower of the gods. 

Sous chef to [[ASK]]. We made muffalettas (sun-dried tomato pesto on toasted ciabatta is cheap and it's good), rice-a-roni, and baked apples (do be kickin'). 

[[Family Gathering]] was delicious. Mi amor, as usual, found a prop-flaw in the dig-up-a-corpse episode of //House//, and we pondered what was forced and incoherent about the storytelling in this episode. As usual, a discussion of religion, as we do. I would 10,000 more of these evenings, please.

Shopping @ Home Depot con mijo. We had fun. Thought about a ice chipper to aid the shovels (big one might be hitting soon). We picked up two cheap yardsticks (squares aint so great for some jobs) and a much better caulking gun, the $10 one instead of the $2 one that broke on us. I'm sure my daughter will thank us, `/nod`. 

[[TTTOTW]]. [[ASK]] is refusing to be discouraged. Very encouraging. Made a mat for my feet since the concrete is still too cold (and I don't like ruining the blanket; still want to wear my shoes...we do not heat the house much, and there is no primary heat source in the basement anyway).
