** [[Memetic Warfare]] has been on the brain a lot. It's going to continue to ramp up over 2020. Fuck.
* [[2020.06.30 - Prompted Introspection: Literacy]]
** Giving up on books for pleasure outside of bathroom reading for 2020. The race is on.

** They got to bed at a more reasonable time tonight. Son snuck away to play vidya games instead of finishing his work. =). I get it. They are a fuckton of fun.

** We still have a very long way to learning how to use our computers. It's weird to see how much will go into being our own librarians.

** You know, you should recommend the KVM route. Dual boot is not going to fix the problem for him (that was what I recommended last too). Doubt he'll want to work on the project though. =/.

** I just noticed that the '‚Ñç' isn't as bold as the lowercase on Windows. That sucks. I like the look so much on [[m16]].
** Not sure where I want to go with it. Meh. That's okay.

** Sometimes I think he's the most inventive of us. I'm curious to see what he will accomplish once he has basic fluency in the primitives.
* [[2020.06.30 - h0p3ful Review: Improving]]
** And, I am right to be worried. Fuck it. It's not up to me.
* [[Lojban: Example Translations]]
** I wonder what the correct equivalence chaining will be.
* [[Lojban: Cheatsheet]]
** I am reminded of how I taught my offspring to read once again. I wonder how reasonable it is to make an expression frequency chart a priori. 
* [[Lojban: Problems & Failures]]
** Being able to transpile to this target would be fine enough. What could be more in the spirit of this than constructing a simplified child (if possible)?
*** I'm far less interested in testing the weak sapir-whorf hypothesis, in some sense, than having something practical to work with.
