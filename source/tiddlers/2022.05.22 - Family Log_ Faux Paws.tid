** Alright, though I need to get more sleep.
* j3d1h
** decent. need to get some hand lotion or somethin, and the fan's making it harder to wake me up, lol.
* k0sh3k
** Sore from hikiing - I'm so out of shape. Tired. But mostly fine. 
* h0p3
** Stomach hasn't been doing well, and my sleep has been flawed. It is acceptable. I've been feeling the pressure of being on my knees this week, and they're sore.
* ASK
** I have been unwell. I'm okay.

!! What was interesting to you last week?

* Being asked by a not-library to give a presentation is super cool! 
* Much needed rain.
* Hiking
* Difficulty in the trip to [[JRE]]'s.
* Heavy dialectics continue
* Labyrinth presentation
* Work on the bathroom continues to stretch. There are more things that have to be done to get it into a shape we'll like. I am [[grateful]] to have a bathroom.
* I talked to three humans, played some extremely good games of MTG, had a wonderful walk, lots of Diablo 2, good food.
* I am once again having a change of mood for games.

!! Outside of our immediate family, who did we have significant social interactions with?

* My original void lurker, my friend in Seattle, and one other who shall remain nameless.

!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family (including ourselves)?

* 1uxb0x
** I got my science logs back up again.
** You're doing a good job working on negotiating [[shared]] work with your sister. That's not easy to do well.
** I'm glad you talked to Biship Curry and Dan - I'm glad you're socializing more, and both men were impressed with you, as a person. Bp. Curry said you ask good questions, and that's always a great skill to develop. 
** i enjoyed chatting about probability with you.
** I think it is sweet how you don't seem to mind being your sister's cat's paw. your friendship is nice to see.
*** Hrm. I can see say this: you are kind and generous to [[others]], son. We are all [[lucky]] to know you.
* j3d1h
** i'm glad i've been reaching out more. it's made me a few friends already. :)
** I appreciate your patience in working on things you don't enjoy. Watching boring [[vidya]]s about economics is not everyone's ideal afternoon.
** I am very glad you are sarky like me. Also, thank you for introducing me to the word 'sarky.' 
***you're very unwelcome (/j), i get the feeling you'll never stop using it.
**** Now there should be a pirate cat named Sarky Jones. That would be a cool graphic novel series for kids. 
** I'm happy that you are working on being more active-such as making a menu.
** Thank you for being so funny when Ranga brings you presents. I am glad so many of them survive.
* k0sh3k
** I'm making good progress on my presentations, and might get them done early - I'm getting better at organizing my time. 
** Thank you for finding the waterfall. It was gorgeous. Hiking is generally unlike you, and I'm glad we got to do it.
** You're doing a good job on your presentation, especially since your interest in it has faded somewhat from the initial explosion.
** Starting a group up for Greek is generous and makes sense. I hope it is one of many more to come. 
** You're kind to folks like the Voynich Manuscript feller. That can be an expensive task. You have a gentle hand.
** Thanks for waiting to leave until I was done asking questions to Bishop Food.
** thank you for the books (and specifically the school guide, i hope it'll be helpful).
* h0p3
** I'm alright at balancing many contradictions, and I [[hope]] to get better. May I catch up to [[Impassasionata]].
** Thanks for helping me set up the hammock stand! And for working so hard on the bathroom; I really appreciate it. 
*** <3
** Thank you for trying.
** thanks for picking up a newer version of clip studio for me.
** I appreciate the offers for help-even though we keep rejecting them. Maybe next time I work on the kitchen alone.
*** You got it. `/salute`.
* ASK
** The chicken parm you just "whipped up" was delicious. Thank you.
** Thank you for so consistently asking me if I need anything to eat or drink. It makes for some pleasant brunches.
** Related: thank you for being generous and offering to help whenever you think of a way to help. 
** You've been practical in working on the basement and attic. It congeals. I'm glad we get to see your process.
** I'm [[grateful]] to understand your kindness, especially in dialectics.
** I've enjoyed our walks, cooking, cleaning, painting, and heading to Home Depot.
*** I hope the strawberries and tomatoes hit the spot.
** thanks for letting us borrow your pathfinder books! :]
** You've been helping-and offering to help-notably more, thank you!
*** I've been helping all along. I am simply not a glory whore. It is kind of sad that you don't notice, but it does explain a few things.
** You help, even when nobody notices or cares. Head pats.
