Most of the ceiling is vault/slanted â€”except the kitchen
Jun 15 5:41pm
So trying to make all the ceiling the same so we can make it one big room
Jun 15 5:42pm
You are doing amazing work. I wish my offspring had the chance to remodel and build with their hands like [[AG]].
Jun 15 5:43pm
They are already so big!
Jun 15 5:43pm
One big room sounds best to me. I like space.
Jun 15 5:43pm
They are getting big pretty quick
Jun 15 5:43pm
They lurv you too.
Jun 15 5:44pm
I would like them big enough to not be pecked by the bigger ones but still small enough to snuggle
Jun 15 5:45pm
How are you folks?
Jun 15 5:46pm
Ah, yeah. I hadn't even thought about the interchicken relationships. I suppose they might be violent to each other.
Jun 15 5:46pm
Mostly Bossy â€”she pecks at the bigger ones too â€”sheâ€™s kinda a bully
Jun 15 5:47pm
How many have names? Lol.
Jun 15 5:47pm
All of them â€”most are related to food
Jun 15 5:48pm
In the big ones there is Bossy, Nugget, Tally (for Italian ckn), Frieda (for fried ckn), Sue (for Southern Fried Chicken)
Jun 15 5:49pm
I can imagine [[UJ]] making a song for them, a limmerick based on their names, lol.
Jun 15 5:50pm
In the little ones...there are Terry (for teriyaki ckn) Mac (for Mcckn) and then Goldie cause she is yellow. The other three are name for gmaâ€™s that have passed
Jun 15 5:51pm
Lois, Mary (loudest most orange chicken) and Gracie
Jun 15 5:51pm
I bet he can hehe
Jun 15 5:52pm
Tally is the sweetest of the big ones
Jun 15 5:53pm
She sits on my lap and lets me pat her
Jun 15 5:54pm
If you went for another set animals, what would they be?
Jun 15 5:56pm
I think maybe goats
Jun 15 6:08pm
Dope
Jun 15 6:08pm
Plus, goat meat is delicious.
