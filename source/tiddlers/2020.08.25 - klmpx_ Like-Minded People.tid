My goodness, you are spittin' straight fucking ùï±ùï¥ùïΩùï∞üî• to the postleft fools (I only watch that sub because I am morally obligated to read my enemies). If you ever need a friend, HMU: https://philosopher.life/

haha thank you comrade I needed that, definitely looking for like-minded people!

 Your 'bottom up' approach and reliance on philosophers has created a clusterfuck in your head, focus on concepts and the pattern not the words, the answer is right infront of you but the words blind you.
"identity and epiphenomenal consciousness emerges from a quadricameral distributed computer network built with some fundamental redundancies"

oh sorry i shouda mentioned i went 'down the rabbithole'!

I agree. It's quite a clusterfuck.
I would study a concept with you, if you wish.
I appreciate that we might not be like-minded people. I aim to think carefully, [[WINTCIS]].

I also appreciate that you kindly aim to give me a model over my percepts.
I only have so much control over my autism.
I do agree that modeling is a profound epistemic weakness in me.

I'm always down for discussion and I don't get to meet many people who even know what dialectics is let alone are aware, I tend to believe that those aware are those on that thin line between wisdom and insanity. I've been chaffing on that line for quite some time, it's always good to reach out to others it provides some necessary balance.

klmpx 11:05 PM
I quoted that line from your writing because that's the basis of the 'model' I use, as in a 'four dimensional' perspective, only someone from the 'ideal' spectrum can come up with something like that, philosophers come from a more '2D' 'material' perspective and are always concerned with naming and categorizing things. We do this too but not in the same way and not for the same purpose. We, as in idealists, tend to compare and contrast things as they are rather than attempting to define and place them into a preconceived notion of division that seeks to eliminate contradiction.
