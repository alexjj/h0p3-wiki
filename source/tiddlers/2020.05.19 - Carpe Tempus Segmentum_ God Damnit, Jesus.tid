** Ranga scared the bejeezus out of me. He made some crazy loud sound (mind you, he is the loudest cat I've ever had, piercing) as the black cat attempted to enter our home. I thought someone was going to die from the sounds of it. I found myself in this shocked blur of partial-awareness, wherein time slowed down but I didn't know my ass from a hole in the ground (which, to be fair, is pretty standard). I'm saying, "what's wrong?! what's wrong!?" Once I gathered my footing, my heart rate cut in half. Once I got to the door, both cats backed away, and I hissed off his opponent. I'm not good at calming Ranga down. =(. He stood there with me until I could find my eye-mask that was thrown off in the flurry.
*** He was so upset he ended up trying to puke. He's super worried. 
**** He's spending more time hanging around us today too. Sitting on his mama's ([[j3d1h]]'s) lap as she does her schoolwork.   
*** Somehow, I'm the only one who woke up to the sound. Wat. It was unholy. 
*** All is well. I got him high AF on le catnips. Drugs solve so many problems. 
** Took me a while to get back to sleep. Thank god for them //Rick & Morty// reruns. Sweet dreams, my retard.

* We performed The Coffee Experiment, again.
** My wife can taste the difference, and she will wretch, sour, and the dramatic ham comes out of her upon barely tasting the pleb-coffee. Poo poo. This coffee tastes like sawdust! 
** I can't really taste a significant difference. Even if I can distinguish them, they taste like coffee. What the fuck are you on about woman? =)

* Wife is making a rosary for a friend and needed a third hole drilled in a bone bead. 
** I was my son's helper. His woodworking vises came in handy. He got it cleanly.

* CS work went poorly, and I ended up giving up my seat to just have them make the VM instead.
** In time, it will be easier for them.
* Walk with wife
** We have noticed that I am far luckier in who passes us by. Female asses are just plain better. Everyone's moving fast, and I get to see all the bounce and squish.
** It's so beautiful. My wife is taking a lot more pictures.

* [[h0p3ful Review]]: My son is having a rough day. =(
* [[vidyas]]: Finished off Ypi, lots of pausing to say it the less diplomatic way (thankfully, there are few places that required correction). She gave a fast high-overview. Sapolsky did his thing too. =)
