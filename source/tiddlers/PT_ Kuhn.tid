title: PT: Kuhn

; 1922-1996: Kuhn

* Logic and observation are not enough to understand how science unfolds; we must look to its history.
* Sciences alternate between periods of "normal science" and periods of "crisis" followed by "revolution".
* It's only when a paradigm is established that empirical underdetermination is solved and normal science is possible.
* The paradigms eventually use up their capacity to solve empirical puzzles, and are replaced by new paradigms.
* A new paradigm is "incommensurable" with the old one; there is no uncontested evidence and shared nomenclature to choose one.
* A procedure of judgement by the scientific community is required for paradigm-choice.
* There is no absolute distinction between the context of discovery and the context of justification.
* We may have to relinquish the notion that paradigm changes carry scientists closer and closer to the truth.
* The development of science is like biological evolution; an increase in articulation and specialization, without an end goal.
