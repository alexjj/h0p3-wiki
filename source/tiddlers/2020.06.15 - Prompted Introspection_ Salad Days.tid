title: 2020.06.15 - Prompted Introspection: Salad Days

!! What is something that made your mother happy?

No, I don't need to be more charitable than I've been to [[SLT]] for her sake, but [[2019.04.02 - Prompted Introspection: Female Donor Happiness]] doesn't cover an important section of my life well enough. I also like having positive things to say about evil people (it's a valuable habit).

Salads made her happy. It needs crunch, fatty dressing, layers of spice, and a variety of veggies. Bacon bits, crushed red pepper flakes, cheeses, and a feeling of eating something healthy go a long way.
