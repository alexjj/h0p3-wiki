title: 2020.11.30 - Prompted Introspection: Expressing Love

!! In what ways are you inhibited from expressing love?

I have my own gibberish-specification of the concept of [[love]]. I meet vanishingly few people who would agree to it, lol. I doubt you initially mean that, Samwise. I take inhibition to be an external force that does not inhibit intention from being intention, but it does modify how that intention can be expressed. This is a [[freedom]] problem concerned with what one would do if em[[power]]ed to do so. I think we likely agree to that, Samwise. Okay, so with Berlin and Hobbes in mind, now this is a Lady Melisandre question. I'm not claiming it's a pointless exercise to {[[dream]]} like that, but I feel like I've done enough of it for now. It is already built into the nature of [[love]] that contingent impediments to expression would be dealt with as lovingly as possible. Be stoic about what is not up to us, including picking out the [[dok]] of impedimentation. There is work to be done here in attempting to overcome impediments; loves expression in the overcoming to enable further expression is not instantaneous either. So, the question is still a good one, though it may imply that I am not loving enough, that I've not stoically isolated what is up to me, or that the process of my intention has not played out yet (and, surely, these are true in many respects in my life). Which do you have in mind?

Let us take the first. I have a very difficult time loving people who don't merit their lives or parts of them that don't merit existence either. This is where I desire to peel apart [[Justice]] from [[The Right]]. You'd think I'd have a great answer by now. I don't. I think empathizing with the world turns me into a kind of monster too, as my immediate reaction is to slit throats. [[Love]] whom? I must hate wisely. Who doesn't want to not feel hate in some sense? It would be great not to have those feelings. So, my paradoxical-seeming answer (at least the first round) is that I'm inhibited from expressing love because I am too selfish to hate [[irwartfrr]] strongly enough.
