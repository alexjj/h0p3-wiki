title: 2020.09.01 - TDL: Accept False-Compromises & Normalize Greater Evil By Voting For The Lesser Of The Apparent Two

* Chops, melons, salad
* [[Monthly Audit]], complete. Close.
* [[MJos]] touch-up?
* Continue transitions away from [[Firmcoding]].
** The commitment.
** Your daughter gets paid for it now that you can. 
* I'd like to see you write something funny and fun!
* Catch her. Make it relaxing. 
* Son needs to try emacs.
** Can't escape this process of trying to find projects worth his time. Just have to limit your willingness to be disappointed: lower your [[hope]]ful expectations to meet predictions in some respects.
