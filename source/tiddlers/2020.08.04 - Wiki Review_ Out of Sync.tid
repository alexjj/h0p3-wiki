title: 2020.08.04 - Wiki Review: Out of Sync

* [[2020.08.03 - /b/]]
** You've had this on the brain a bunch. You are obviously stupidly worried about your offspring. All you can do is increase the odds, and it's not up to you in many respects.
* [[2020.08.03 - Link Log: Apophenically Infer Sexiness Causing Moral Virtue]]
** Yeah, I am the out of sync loser, lol. May I be useful to [[Humanity]].
* [[2020.08.03 - Wiki Review: Toning My Me Down]]
** Completed. I wonder if one day she will use these practices as metaphors. Well, not many would think it sane. 
** I think one of the reasons it can't spread is that it's not conventional enough. 
*** It's also just so goddamn expensive to do. It's not that it's not doable, but it's simply unlikely. 
**** Take [[K]] for instance: it's not really that clear to me that he loves to read and write (even though he majored in it and he's going to teach it).
* [[2020.08.03 - TDL: Decatastraphize]]
** Alright, alright, alright: that's the way you do it. Instead of merely lowering your expectations, remove the element of prediction altogether! Lmao. 
** So proud of you. 
* [[2020.08.03 - Prompted Introspection: Directness]]
** Completed. Unfortunately, I find that eventually, maintaining a relation requires me to not be direct. It is here that I have to work overtime to remap it. If I'm not allowed to speak my mind, then my interlocutor will simply have to lead the blind the entire time, and facing the dual-[[Straussian]] borderline dogwhistle answers sucks (I'm going to interpret best and worst versions, at least).
* [[2020.08.03 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: We Have Food]]
** Completed. Those phase 3 committee meetings are going to kill me. 
*** It's also just way too fucking hot. =(
* [[2020.08.03 - h0p3ful Review: It Could Be Bunnies]]
** Yeah, you do exude it, kiddo. XD. Most people never see it. 
*** I would be willing to bet that will change. 
** This is one she'll have to read again and again, perhaps. 
** It is rare that I put her on the immediate spot so publicly. Escalation.
* [[2020.08.03 - h0p3ful Review: Keep Reading!]]
** I'm so [[grateful]] when we have the chance to see that 2020 is like a quantum leap in the [[Yearly Cross-section]]. Verifiable, clean chain of custody, nails a subset of the subjectivity problematic, and it's fun to see growth.
** Sometimes, my son is the only other person I know who can do that. I don't believe I've ever made that argument to him, and it is shocking to see a 12yo boy go full-blown Saint Kant in such a hard place.
