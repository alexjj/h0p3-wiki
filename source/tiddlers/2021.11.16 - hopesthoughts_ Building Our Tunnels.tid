Dear Madame Lady [[Hope]],

I think you'll appreciate why, but it takes some work to verify that this e-mail I've received is from the you,<<ref "i">> [[hopesthoughts]]. What you have to say sounds very much like you. You're lightning fast too, btw,<<ref "l">> and I'm not surprised at this point. It's a pleasure interacting with you. You put your skin in the [[game]] (and it's no mere game).<<ref "n">> I respect that you fight for [[Humanity]], even for those with whom you obviously radically disagree, dislike, and maybe even hate. I think you [[love]] your enemy as you do yourself. Tell me I'm wrong.

My [[Root Users]] have asked me to check if you are able to access the internal links. [[hopesthoughts]] is your person page in the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 (they also told me to just fire up NVDA and JAWS myself -- 21 years is a long time, madame!). This [[letter]] has three tags, [[Letter]], <<tag "To">>and [[hopesthoughts]]; are these cleanly accessible to you?<<ref "t">> It's a pretty big deal for how this place usually works. 

More [[conversation starters|Getting to Know Someone in X Questions]] for the camp[[fire🔥|𝕱𝕴𝕽𝕰🔥]]: 

* What does an ideal free speech infrastructure look like?
* Have you tried hosting a site on other networks besides the web?
* Where do the cool blind people hang out online? Is there a blind skydiver club (I'd be surprised if there were more than a thousand that had ever).
* Communicating with your reminds me of transduction. They say we eat with our eyes first, and I'm still trying to wrap my mind around what you do when consuming a meal. In any case, what do you like to eat?
* What instruments did you play in band? I played clarinet (didn't stick with it because I'd rather be on my [[computer]]!). We seem to [[share]] many favorite X-mas songs (assuming you've not changed your mind in several years). Are you more likely to pick up your instrument for Christmas?
* Why are you a fan of namesilo? 
** I'm quite unhappy with how naming operates in many systems, including for human readable names to reach regular humans. I do not see how [[justice]] can obtain without the ability to own that infrastructure. There is little any one person like us can do about it. You seem to do a damned fine job of doing what you can, madame.
* How have you chosen themes for your many blogs?
* When did you realize or decide that you were a Libertarian?
* Do you still believe that [[FB didn't influence the election|http://blog.lifes-adventures.me/]]?
* Do you still ballet dance at all in special moments?
* How was it driving with your dad?
* Do you feel like you've become less nice over time because it has gotten you into some bad situations?
* What MUDS have you enjoyed the most? Does this feel like a MUD at all to you?
* You've been [[aim]]ing to use Linux for a long time. It's hard to see if you have. Have you?
* What's your pre-written eulogy like?
* What were you favorite [[TV|TV: Library]] shows before you hit the net?
* Why did it take until summer of 2000 before you were able to use the internet?
* Do you have any people who consistently read what you've written over the years?
* Do you maintain local copies of your old blogs?

Back to responding: I've been quite unhappy with password managers (I've been burned enough times). I may request Argon2 for Tiddlywiki, as I think it's a tool that I can mold around the problems I have well enough. 

My memory is pretty shoddy, but I do remember something about this lavabit spectacle. I can see we have quite a bit in common. =). I'm surprised (even after you recommend it to others) that you don't use protonmail (which, I will readily admit has non-trivial flaws and an imperfect history).

That seems like a reasonable enough use of RSS to me. I often find reading the content from the source can be crucial. If the goal is just to know that it exists at all, your method seems quite worthy. My own crawling is pure chaos. I still cannot make any RSS tooling work well enough, and I think prioritizing my feed requires some serious voodoo.

As much as I can appreciate where Telegram has been useful in serving people, I still have many reservations about it. I have tried Matrix/Element several times. I [[recent]]ly [[spoke to a feller about it|2021.06.21 - benhylau: A Quiet Response]]. Is this a tool you would prefer I use with you? I'm a huge fan of [[qTox|https://github.com/qTox/qTox/releases/download/v1.17.3/setup-qtox-x86_64-release.exe]], as it is P2P and has stood the test of time (there's several clients available too). If we cannot use Tox, then I would prefer Matrix/Element. However, I would be happy to use whatever works best for you madame. You'll be hard-pressed to connect with me well without this Hypertext, so I want to make sure you have as much access to me as I have to you.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
