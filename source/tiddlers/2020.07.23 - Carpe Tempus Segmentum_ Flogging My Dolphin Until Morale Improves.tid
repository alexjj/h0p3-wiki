title: 2020.07.23 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Flogging My Dolphin Until Morale Improves

* Woke at 11:30
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Offspring had planned well enough for the meal. Made sure they prepped in advance.
* [[h0p3ful Review]]
** Both my offspring are feeling the heat. Ugh. 
** It wasn't all bad. They knew what I was going to say before I said it. Glad to see them picking up math again (lawd, they have lost a lot).
* [[JRE]] and I talked
** Pebble shits and drool
** Build frustrations, boot problems
** Talked more about categorizing his media. He's thinking about starting from scratch here.
*** Or, he'll need to use the linux-based file recovery tooling
** Speech therapy
** Doesn't want the RPi plugged in (maybe?), and doesn't want to lend me a VM. 
*** Maybe he means to say something else.
* I am missing my beads! The weight of them, the smoothness, the metallic liquid: it's delicious. I have a small box of stim trinkets at this point, and only the cube has ever competed like that. 
** It's the music that it makes. Same for the cube. 
* Read+Write+Walk+Talk
** Fascinating to see [[saya]]'s gigantic bookmark collection. 
*** Not a lot of people would construct it, let alone share it.
* Offspring and I decided to make some loaves of double chocolate bread. 
** Somewhere between cake and brownies. Pure drugs.
* The Walk
** The Chinese Spy has signaled that she isn't interested in speaking.
*** I get it now. I'm slow. Lol. The usual libertarian boomer arm's length. I hear ya.
** We took an extra long route down where we've never been.
*** Found a nifty spot meant for sitting and praying. 
*** I also found a trail of stairs to a house leading straight onto this nifty spot. If we did ever get a house, it would be so amazing to have one on the trail. 
**** Having one on the beach is cool, but the trail is a special haven. 
** We spent most of the walk thinking about my wife's work.
*** As usual, I'm thinking outloud, guessing, probably delusional. Of course, you fuckin' retard! =)
*** Had to fight to ensure libraries could still have public machines available. 
*** I'm slow, but I now have a stronger model of both of her mentors in relation to the apparatus. 
**** My questions appear to clarify the story for her too. Not a waste.
*** SZ and J have a disagreement, and my wife is having to pick sides wisely.
**** She's going to have to pick the home-team here.
**** My wife has been wise to turn down privileges where she has. She thinks much faster on her feet than I ever could. 
*** IP liability, acquisitions as middlemen, the crisis is leaving power vacuums
**** A is having to go to bat for big things. He's searching blind in some of these places. Nobody has the answer.
***** And S-like predators thrive on that chaos.
*** Continue to see signals from SZ that my wife may be a tech-heavy protege being groomed (which has occurred in the past three libraries, though not all were honest). All the committees and people picked out by hand for her (and reasons given) seem like it. SZ is the highest a librarian gets without becoming more politician than librarian, and I can see why she turned down taking her bosses' job before they offered it to him.
*** B is meeting the entire hierarchy below her, and it doesn't yet appear to be a mere gesture. I don't know if we get another chance at this. It looks like this is a first-impression, one-time exchange of information, and that one must be done correctly. 
**** We are right in her specialty wheelhouse. She must be studied, and that encounter must be prepped.
***** The only thing that appears to take priority is just surviving the open.
**** I want to know what SZ is going to say to this person.
*** Prepping for the yearly review eventually. That's in 5 months. 
**** Accounting appears to be a crucial consideration yet again.
* Fireman Time!
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Offspring made tendies, peas, wedges (with heavy paprika, dope).
** I'm drinking more coffee.
** [[Debatable]]
*** 100x smoother. I wonder what we can do to learn 80% without engaging in the ugly process. 
* Read+Write+Walk+Talk
* Sleep by 5
