"""
How's your week been?
Aug 14 5:13pm
Trying to dig myself out of the stuff that I need to do before Monday when school starts
Aug 14 5:39pm
😊
Aug 14 5:39pm
Oof.
Aug 14 5:39pm
Need shovel 😊
Aug 14 5:39pm
I'm sorry. It's gotta be thoroughly more complex and energy consuming this year. (｡•́︿•̀｡)
Aug 14 5:41pm
Excited to start actually —but wow  lots of stuff
Aug 14 5:41pm
What's in the todo heap?
Aug 14 5:42pm
Trying to set up elearning and in person and ready to move each day/hour
Aug 14 5:43pm
That is exciting. I could imagine it requires planning to be flexible.
Aug 14 8:13pm
Are your students excited about it too you think?
Aug 14 8:13pm
I think so —[[AG]] is bored and ready to be back
Aug 14 8:24pm
How's [[UJ]] doing? Still starting on Monday?
Aug 14 8:25pm
He is starting on the 24 th
Aug 14 8:25pm
Cool.
Aug 14 8:26pm
I assume he's gotta be pretty busy too.
Aug 14 8:26pm
They are doing an A/B schedule
Aug 14 8:26pm
k
Aug 14 8:26pm
Yeah things keep changing
Aug 14 8:27pm
So kids come two days a week and the other days they work at home
Aug 14 8:27pm
I appreciate that approach. It is a difficult position to be in.
Aug 14 8:28pm
Yeah and at least this spreads out the amount of kids
Aug 14 8:28pm
My old employer in TN still messages me. They are doing something similar.
Aug 14 8:29pm
Yeah its hard
Aug 14 8:39pm
So many kids rely on food and services from schools
Aug 14 8:40pm
That is my primary immediate concern.
Aug 14 10:14pm
Mine too —they have continued to serve breakfast and lunch for anyone who needs but I fear there are kids who can’t make it to a school to pick up the food
Aug 14 10:15pm
Correct. =(
Aug 14 10:15pm
And there are many less abuse/neglect reports ....because there is no one to see the kids or listen to them
Aug 14 10:16pm
Aye. Has to be extra hell being trapped at home for them.
Aug 14 10:19pm
Definitely true so I am glad they are headed back even for a few days a week
