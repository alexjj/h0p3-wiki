title: 2020.05.08 - Prompted Introspection: The Hunt

!! You have to invite 5 people to dinner, dead or alive. Who do you invite and why?

[[2018.09.05 - Prompted Introspection: 5 Person Dinner]] is hilarious. Yeah, that was sick. I'll shoot for the living this time. I'm going to functionally name the unnamed in this case. I need to get in a room with 5 people who believe in [[The Golden Rule]], who aren't averse to socialism, and who are willing to sacrifice. [[TOP]] has to be built. I don't even know who best fits to maximize the odds of such a thing. I can pick out particular strains, but it's a systematic issue. I'm still hunting.
