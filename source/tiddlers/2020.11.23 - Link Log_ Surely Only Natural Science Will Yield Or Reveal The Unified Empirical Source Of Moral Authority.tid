*** Fed seems more powerful than the treasury (both can create money ex nihilo, but perhaps both are not equally inflationary [direct stimulus may be higher, but that is evidence of two economies to me]), its use is anticipated by the capitalist's market (i'd suck that corporate bond buying tit too, surely). Finance owns everything, including the political processes that finance is betting on (might be betting that Treasury will be singing a different tune next year too). Nobody acts as though they believe it can fail or fall; this is the only way to convince us their money matters.

*** This seems to be a strong reason to think F2F is the only way to build competing networks in the end.

*** Reminds me of [[kicks]]' presentation. Also F2F model seems preferred here.

* Fishy

*** He gets closer. Glad to see it. Plus, incidentally, I think he does a good job of attacking the neo-Rationalist^^tm^^ position at least for the sake of pacifying some vampires. He plants a backdoor seed of doubt (reminds me of gnostic abuses of method), nebulosity of the narcissist's egoistic sensibilities, it's spoonfed more palatably, seeking metaframing and fluidity to avoid cerebral narcissism from taking full-control. He cannot solve the problem (dooms himself from the outset on purpose maybe), but he does some preventative care work.
