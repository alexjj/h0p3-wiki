title: 2021.07.21 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Coomthinkpilled

Fireman Time! Cleaning. Watermelon. [[TTTOTW]]. Wrote up more for [[SNilsen]], since perhaps he's down to play ball and it's my last shot. Sleep by 2? IDK.

Woke at 8. Hell yes. Meditation. Hugs'n'bugs. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! Whiskey + LoLVod. Feeling meh. Talked with muh losers + Dark Chocolate + [[1010010]]'s recommendation. Then we began. Tears again. I [[hope]] [[SNilsen]] will see what needs to be done. We have very different visions, but he's extremely intelligent. He doesn't adore computers in the way I do, but he adores computation. I have [[hope]] that he will hit the point I asked him to think about 6 months ago, despite being swept up in the neo-rationalist movement.

Nap. Hit me like a truck. Woke at 3? She came down. Said we were going. Dope. 

Hit the library. I tried not to annoy anyone more than usual. Talked about names older than YHWH, [[SNilsen]]'s project, and why I'm feeling sad. 

Shopping @ W-Entity con mi amor. She needs stuff to do physical therapy, grabbed some food too, power-steering fluid as well. I had to take a shit real bad. So I did (unfortunately, my phone has zero connection in that building: it is horrific...I browsed an old copy of the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 from 2019 instead like a savage). My stank scared some kid off as I was leaving the bathroom. I hope they learned their lesson. Oh, oh, OH! My wife deployed rhetoric to convince some woman to buy one of [[5c0ut]]'s cakes. Took 20 seconds. 

Offspring are mailing it in today. This is 5 days of failure to finish their chore from Saturday, and their homework makes me mad and sad too. KMN. At least his handwriting is better than mine, and my daughter joked with me about spoiling //The Odyssey// (`/mean-mug`). They won't be as stupid as I am, but they will be every bit as lazy. I guarantee it.

//Skintime// + Tube. Inform the Men! Sweet baby jesus.<<ref "j">> I feel a lot better. I'm a very, very simple man. Study the secrets of the universe: it's pussy. Meditation. [[TTTOTW]]. 

Vapelyfe + [[TTTOTW]] with her in [[The Den]]. Jammed to the 80's.

[[Family Gathering]] was awesome. [[5c0ut]] made [[magic]] happen with few ingredients (we're getting low on many things). I don't know how he prepares his salmon, but it's the correct way. I wish I knew how to describe it beyond "this feels and actually tastes like butter" (he's the Asian Paula Deen or something). Teriyaki Salmon, Amish Som Tam (look, he didn't have the classic ingredients, but it was motherfuckin' somtam!), Rice, Water. //Arrested Development//. I'm going to be crushed when this show is over for us. =(.

[[TTTOTW]]. Tears again. I'm on a roll today. Oh, fuck, I remember what I'm supposed to do. I'm supposed to dance. Dumbass. DANCE> You got it, keeper.
