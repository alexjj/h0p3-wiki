title: 2020.10.30 - Prompted Introspection: Takes Too Long

!! What takes too long?

There's too many answers for this one; answering it would take too long. In a sense, it's one of the reasons that I live a hikki lifestyle too. I look at most forms of traveling and going out into the world as not being worth my time and my spoons. The risk of failure is already high enough. It rarely offers me useful models, and sometimes equivalently valuable experiences can be virtualized. There's a bias toward things I'm familiar with too, of course. Virtual worlds can be so much more price-efficient. There's something to be said for having gone to the Grand Canyon (and perhaps even more than once), but after that I find a high-quality picture of it to do it justice.<<ref "i">> We know some big things don't work correctly in my head, and this may be one of them. There is always something unique about being there, and I should engage in it more often (my walks are good for me). I don't feel like I have a ton of time (though I'm sure many would beg to differ), and I have to make moves that fit into the puzzles around me, especially my obligations.
