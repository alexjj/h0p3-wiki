title: 2021.11.10 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: kiss her during anal to suck the straw around your dick

//Skintime// + IASIP with [[ASK]]. Sleep by 1?

Woke at 8. Missed a cycle, I think. I'm up though. Push brix. Hugs'n'bugs. Fireman Time! Laundry. [[TTTOTW]]. Answering questions about [[Gradual]]ized [[T42T]]. That's rare (and it has come up twice, back to back days).

I spent the entire fucking morning walking through the Maymay section of all the [[Link Log]]s. Thousands of images! Maybe 5% or so had rotted, and I was able to recover (and replace the links for) 90% of those (the newer, the easier: I'd like to thank whoever the fuck on plebbit is doing the lawd's work `/salute` - you've done a good job for several years). [[5c0ut]] and [[ASK]] chilled with me some as I zoomed through them. They took the Meyers-Briggs test together. ENFP. That makes 4 in this house to my INTJ. `/nod`. Of course, [[search_social]], `/salute`. 

I've got 66 images (ǝuo ʇuᴉɐ ɥɔʇᴉq ɐ puɐ) in total to print, cut out, apply to the card stock, and make shiny with that hodge podge shit (two types, and a bunch of the cheap foam brushes, as my wife needs this stuff too). I think it's going to make the folding wall pretty cool (I may be wildly wrong). Was talking with [[ASK]] about it, and I'd be interested in having more word-based political maymay [[art]] on the ceiling, and she suggested we use red string and pins to go full-blown pepe silvia on the ceiling. What could be more fitting for a madman? 

Lightning Struck! Good news.

The offspring and I made dinner. We had a bit of time to grind, but not much. Git for my son, [[Rust]] for my daughter. [[ASK]] told me she cried 4 times today, but none of it bad. All good tears.

//The Walk// with the offspring was cut to a shorter route since my daughter's foot wasn't doing so well. The usual for their work. Son walked us through some git concepts, and I kept pushing. He's gonna get there. My daughter continued the discussion on enums and structs. She's feeling like she's missing more and more, and so she's repeating content (good). She brought up that she's really tired of not having a chat program that won't change unless she wants it too (talked plenty of shit about Discord's CEO today as well [a rabbithole down NFTs and the continued attempt to slap a b-word into errythang). Wants to build her own from raTox or from scratch. Woot! [[Outopos]] high-level questions. I think she understands why better now, plenty of interruptions from her to extend the issue.

Shopping at W-Entity with [[ASK]]. Picked up craft supplies for the maymay art (the cutest fucking mini clothes pins I've ever seen too), and what she needs for her desk. Saw William again. He said he's not allowed to talk long again, so we kept it short. I grabbed more spices for my daughter as well. Hit the pharmacy, as there [[ASK]] is in dire need of something. We negotiated with the lady for a while, and I think we have a plan that makes sense.

She came and got me. //Raw Skintime//. Told me about her day. A is putting the nail in the coffin again on the office but refuses to do anything else about it. Officially garbage. Aced the test that she didn't study for last night (worried over nothing, woman); always the first done, in a third of the allotted time. She's in a better mood today (has been throughout all our chatting too). //Inform the Men!// Good goddess. Shower of the gods! 

[[Family Gathering]] was solid. Chili + Cornbread. I had beer and wine too. We watched the jazz paternity episode of //House//. 

[[ASK]] and I put together her new desk (two 2x2 cube shelves with a nice [well, for me] piece of cedar I had planned on making a table with one day, using 4 strips of 15lb velcro to hold the top down). It's a [[PH]] for now that might not actually need to change. Need to find a way to improve her chair (which won't rise). Took some of her computer apart, cleaned it, put it altogether (I'm moved another of my power strips onto my UPS and gave her the other outlet opening for hers). The room is a sea of cables and cubeshelves. She felt sad after we talked about the history of her machine (someone very close to her did wrong by her), but it is a nice machine. 2700x, 32GB, 2TB NVME, GTX 1080, Corsair.build, LEDed into oblivion (very her). Everything is barely fitting, but it works. We still have the walkspace I need, and the coffeetable will be moved (as it has been anyway) into position when necessary (otherwise, it functions now as a sidetable, an improvement).

[[TTTOTW]].
