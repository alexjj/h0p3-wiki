title: 2022.09.23 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Filled With My Peeps

[[TTTOTW]]. Chatting with [[squirrelcity]]. Unpredicted noodles. Hardthink. Sleep by 4:30?

Didn't get up until 2:15, but probably in a dazed state since noonish. Meditation and {[[dreams]]} in the liminal space. [[Morning Routine]]. Caffeine. Cleaning my wounds. [[TTTOTW]].

Offspring started the grind by checking on the fluids on //The Beast//. Need to buy transmission fluid. Basic chores, and my daughter found a PSU for the monitor, `/fingers-crossed`. Measured their desk-beds, and we thought about what would be necessary to extend them (since I think 28-30" is going to be necessary long-term). Hesitant, but perhaps a project they will take up. [[5c0ut]] offered a dishwashing position, and I continued to reason with my daughter about the value of the experience. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Talked with mi amor on the phone as she drove home. A very worthy use of our time. Went by quickly for her too.

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. //Inform the Men!// [[TTTOTW]].

[[Family Gathering]] was delicious. We had Asian pulled pork with two kinds of cabbage, and I put mine in tortillas with that dope mayo. I had chai tea + lemonade combo. Good. //House of Cards// (my daughter did fall asleep during it...). 

[[TTTOTW]]. Bugged mi amor. [[TTTOTW]].

//The Walk// with my sympaticon. It's cold outside! I wore pants and a hoodie, and I was still cold. Wind tears right through. 3 U-loops. 

Brix. Cleaning my wounds. Bandages and toenails. //Steven Universe// with my sympaticon. There are now three people in [[The Alien Asylum]], including [[5c0ut]], who swear up and down by this show. I am doing my best. `/nod`. Chocolate ice cream + partial lolvod with my sympaticon.

[[squirrelcity]] responds. Thinkin'.
