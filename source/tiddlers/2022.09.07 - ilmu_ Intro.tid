"""
2:00:15 AM - [[h0p3]]: It is my honor to meet you, [[nomad]]. I already feel quite a kinship with your writing. I will be reading it all, if I can help it. You do not need to do the same for me; I think you have much more important things to do. This is me: https://philosopher.life. My memory is poor, but I'd like to know: have we ever met before?
1:14:09 PM - [[ilmu]]: No I don't think we've met
1:15:02 PM - [[ilmu]]: I already took a look at your website though because I read some of you comment history after you suggested that we need to order feeds by trust (which is what I also want to do as you can see :)
3:38:58 PM - [[ilmu]]: (sent a link here rather than linkdump, the irmin link)

2:11:41 AM - [[h0p3]]: That [[kickscondor]] feller, the author of [fraidycat](http://philosopher.life/#2019.11.06%20-%20HN%3A%20Fraidycat), is a genius (whom I barely understand, despite my best efforts). I was [[lucky]] to watch and think about that tool with him. It's a high-functioning piece of [[art]]. I'm a huge fan of Tiddlywiki too. I'm happy to see your link to it yesterday. There's a treasure trove in your [[link log]] here.

1:18:32 PM - [[ilmu]]: Yeah this linkdump channel is great! I used to be hesitant to dump links in the telegram channel so there's quite a lot of months where I ran into interesting stuff but didn't have a way to proliferate it
3:38:45 PM - [[ilmu]]: https://irmin.io/
