title: 2021.08.29 - Family Log: eugh

!! How has your health been this week?

* 1uxb0x
** Good.
* j3d1h
** Decent, maybe more emotionally sensitive?
* k0sh3k
** Very tired and some more headaches this week. Didn't get to go to PT, and really feeling the difference - so I guess it's doing something, hey? 
* h0p3
** Headaches most of the week (sleep continues to be all over the place, ofc), but it was fine. I'm pleased with my week, and I'd take my headaches again for such a week, gladly. It kinda feels like a whirlwind with that whackamole thing (struggling to fit everything in), but in a good way. Much closer to playing an MMORPG.

!! What was interesting to you last week?

* I wrote my ass off. It was solid.
**It's still there. It may be bigger. 
* This week was hectic at work - but my new chair is great! 
** I want to sit in it. Aint never sat in a chair that cost that much.
* Finished up Lyoko work, I think.

** I'm happy with my job organizing the downstairs.
** You've been ambitiously answering questions on behalf of your sister on our walks. It's good to see. It used to be the other way around so much, but you've been inserting yourself into the conversation to help it grow wonderfully. I've cherished walking with you this week. You're growing up, sir. It's a treat to behold.
** You did a damned good job downstairs, sir. It looks excellent. You went above and beyond.
** Thank you for being quick to admit you didn't do something you ought to have done and tell me how you're going to fix it if you can't fix it immediately - like forgetting to do the cat things and doing them immediately when asked, and not being able to finish mowing but letting me know when you'll get it done. I appreciate it! 
** You did a good job cooking that beef, sir. 
** You're often the first to react when I need some help. Thank you for that.

** I think I'm getting better at predicting my friends' tastes in music.
** Your new art piece is really nice! I like how much thought you put into each work, and that you want to make sure it's conveying what you want it to convey, with as little context as possible. It's good work to pursue. 
** Good job on the fried tomatoes! 
*** Hear hear! Dope AF.
** I appreciate how suspicious you are of the media you consume (and the authors), downright critical even. I hope you will use those powers to reconstruct too (a tall task, indeed).
*** Yeah, screw that dude. You know better. 
** You've been thorough and thoughtful in fleshing out the means to the ends of our collaboration. You've proven yourself correct again and again too. 
** You're obviously growing more adept with your tooling for [[art]], and I hope you start taking leaps into the tools that scare you. Dive into the pool, love.
** Your criticisms of the Effective Altruism movement were spot on. You've got a great intuition. 
** Even when you're making food you're new to, you often make great food.
* k0sh3k
** I'm very proud of my ability to create a new normal at work despite having no clue what the old normal was like. 
** You were resilient and patient without your hot water. I know an uncomfortable shower is a blow to your decompression time. 
** Your encylopedic knowledge provides something so special to our offsprings' education. We're all [[lucky]] to see you wrestle with them during dinner.
** You're a cool (not just good) boss, [[Miss Direction]].
** Thank you for making sure we know what our schoolwork is going to be.
** Thanks for always explaining the context we need.
* h0p3
** My wife says reading my letters is like having a fruitcake forced down her throat. That is exactly what I want her to feel. We did it. You may nibble, but watch the teeth, woman.
*** *_* 
** Nice letter, dude.
*** But In all seriousness, you tend to be very connecting in your letters. You definitly don't lag behind in your writing.
** You are able to find a surprising amount of friends.
*** Lol I'm surprised you find any, too. 
** I appreciate your drive to think about hard topics even when it's painful and your brain is on fire. 
** Thanks for trying to show us new shows fairly often.
