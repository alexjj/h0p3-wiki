How's it going, sir?

Hey, g'afternoon!
Jun 11 2:06pm
=) yo!
Jun 11 2:07pm
Feeling petty and pouty. But overall pretty good. Just doing the cartoon work
Jun 11 2:07pm
Was about to do some vacuuming
Jun 11 2:07pm
How about you?
Jun 11 2:07pm
Same, overall pretty good. Mixed emotions. Offspring driving me a bit insane today.
Jun 11 2:09pm
I'm a fan of the FX6300, btw.
Jun 11 2:11pm
Ah, bless you for putting up with their shenanigans :)
Jun 11 2:25pm
What do you know about the FX6300? The tower was put together by a friend of mine, and it's stood up to my upwards trending needs over the years.
Jun 11 2:26pm
I haven't made a comparison myself with what's on the market
Jun 11 2:27pm
Your friend has good taste. It was built to last.
Jun 11 2:27pm
I assume that professional art/animation software tends to be heavily threaded in some cases too.
Jun 11 2:28pm
Well, I'm no Industrial Lights and Magic, but my needs tend to mirror those of a fairly serious gamer.

Not that I'm a serious gamer, but hard to resist the buy twitch looking at that!
Jun 11 2:37pm
That was...a lot of scrolling!

Huge number of games. Reminds me of how exciting it was to find offers for CDs with game demos in magazines and even cereal boxes.
Jun 11 3:35pm
The amount of content in the world is dizzying. What are we even?
Jun 11 4:20pm
I remember replaying over and over this CD I got at a garage sale with demos for Jane of the jungle, maybe jazz jackrabbit?

Heat dissipators probabilistically modeling their models of the material and immaterial worlds.
Jun 11 4:21pm
*I* bring the heat, man!
Jun 11 4:21pm
hell yeah! =)
Jun 11 4:21pm
You are sometimes ùï±ùï¥ùïΩùï∞ itself to me.
Jun 11 4:22pm
I like looking at your link logs and picked out the Python automaton classes. Might dive in when I make the time
Jun 11 4:22pm
Python is my favorite programming language. I am a bad programmer, and yet, I think it's really good even for good programmers.
Jun 11 4:23pm
Tell me how I might say things that are relevant or useful or usefully destructive to yoy
Jun 11 4:23pm
I trust your instincts.
Jun 11 4:23pm
I remember getting really excited as a kid coming home from the library with books on html
Jun 11 4:24pm
What immense power even basic coding lends a kid
Jun 11 4:24pm
I agree.
Jun 11 4:24pm
I think my first website was a gawdy angelfire hub for my Pokemon drawings
Jun 11 4:25pm
=)
Jun 11 4:25pm
Do your offspring still wonder at what's at their fingertips?
Jun 11 4:26pm
Angelfire is a special place for me too. My "gdoghomes" begins there.
Jun 11 4:26pm
Not as much as I'd like. Maintaining wonder is a hard problem.
Jun 11 4:27pm
They are curious people though.
Jun 11 4:28pm
Google nor wayback giving up any secrets on this 'gdoghomes'
Jun 11 4:29pm
He quickly became someone who studied the concept of secrets, which is not to claim he was successful.
