I could not imagine trying to date after having been married.

You won’t believe what happened while I was on cloud nine this morning

My parents took my dog to a place that is for the whole weekend even after I had said no previously and they didn’t even ask this morning

Yes they totally could have
Aug 21 3:57pm
That sucks
Aug 21 3:57pm
They aren’t my people
Aug 21 3:57pm
It sounds like they don't always care what you think and feel.
Aug 21 3:58pm
My donors are missionaries. Some of the most headstrong and arrogant humans I've ever encountered.<<ref "2021.08.22-2">>
Aug 21 3:58pm
Also I thought [[k0sh3k]] would find that guy funny because he’s a CFO and was wearing blue salt life shorts and a giraffe riding a cheetah
Aug 21 3:58pm
Yeah they absolutely aren’t my people
Aug 21 3:58pm
Which sucks
Aug 21 3:58pm
=(
Aug 21 3:59pm
However I found an apartment
Aug 21 3:59pm
Dope
Aug 21 3:59pm
And, the date sounds like fun!
Aug 21 3:59pm
Potentially moving to the forest at biltmore
Aug 21 3:59pm
We outdoor bar hopped
Aug 21 3:59pm
Haha
Aug 21 3:59pm
Ate nothing and drank beer I made him choose mine hahaha
Aug 21 4:00pm
As a test
Aug 21 4:00pm
I’m supposed to see him later however I haven’t heard from him in a bit but he is with a buddy fishing hahaha 😂
Aug 21 4:01pm
 would not be good at choosing beer. Don't get me wrong, I adore beer. I've had a decent variety of them, but I don't think I have good taste in it, lol.
Aug 21 4:05pm
Alcohol is a drug I have used heavily at some points in my life. Sometimes that's the only reason I've gotten the through night. My poor liver.
Aug 21 4:06pm

Ooh yeah it was chill and yeah I definitely understand that and I’m sorry to hear that
Aug 22 8:19am
Great and fun date dude ended up texting me at 6 o’clock saying don’t be mad I have to do this work so that I can have fun Saturday-Monday
Aug 22 8:19am
Lol after that no communication
Aug 22 8:20am

<<footnotes "2021.08.22-1" "With that attitude, I can see why. You don't actually care about them correctly, and you're digging for the wrong treasure. Continued hedonic treadmill spirals is my prediction, but I think you have enough of the fundamentals of your previous [[faith]] to reconstruct one that makes sense. You're smart enough to do it too.">>

She still doesn't understand she needs [[help]] with that one; we all do. I know, we're all fierce, independent creatures. That is too big to not require [[the other]] to process it.
