title: 2021.08.10 - Prompted Introspection: Doubling Pleasure & Pain

!! Would you rather double the amount of emotional pain and pleasure you feel on a daily basis, or cut both in half?

This question reminds me a bit of these:

I do not know the correct answer. I will agree that it is likely the case that [[dok]] of capacity for pleasure or pain require a symmetrical capacity in the other. Your interesting question is non-trivially related, Samwise. I'm worried about the utility monster under the bed here too. I can say there are times where more pain would have ended my life, but do I predict I will experience that again? No. And, even then that risk might be worth taking. Sensitivity is critical to my autistic intelligence; I have very high throughput and many odd gadgets in my toolboxes, but I am not naturally a skilled modeler (as is obvious in how I speak alone). Insofar as all emotions are related to the seemingly binary motivations of pleasure and pain, doubling my sensitivity to pain and pleasure may imply radical alterations in most of my awarenesses. I do not know the answer, Samwise. I will say that I don't think there are many people working in the spaces I do (or, few I trust), I'm failing to immanentize the eschaton, and I don't predict that will change, therefore, I am likely obligated to guess the correct answer is doubling. I do not morally own myself all the way down, Samwise. What do you think?
