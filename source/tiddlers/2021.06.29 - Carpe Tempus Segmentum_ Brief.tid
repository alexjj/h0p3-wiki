title: 2021.06.29 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Brief

Honey Whiskey + [[TTTOTW]] + LolVod. Laundry.

She looked exhausted. It's hot in her room, and she hasn't adjusted to it. Trying to avoid the noise isn't worth it. Hopefully, she'll sleep better tomorrow. Also, her employer gifted another set of meals to her. Dope. 

Fam still using the etherpad in patches. Seems to be a latenight kind of check-in. We're spread across so many tools; I know that's expensive (lawd do I). It works though. Hope it continues to grow.

Slept at 9? Woke at 3?

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! Cleaning.

Son buzzed my head. We talked about their non-existent schoolwork. They have made progress in their programming though. Real world shit. I'll take it. Son is responsible for a lot, and I hope he comes prepared. Shower. 

No time for shows. //Inform the Men//. Meditation. [[TTTOTW]].

Prepared dinner with my offspring.

[[Family Gathering]] in [[The Den]] (because it's still just crazy hot upstairs). We had chicken pot pies and cantelope, water too. We watched //Arrested Development//. My daughter misses zero beats. [[Lucky]]. Whole fam chilled.

Fell asleep at 9? I don't know. Hit me like a truck.
