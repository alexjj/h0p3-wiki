[[ASK]] buzzed my head and cut my hair how she likes it with scissors. Shower. [[TTTOTW]].

Like Retroshare, I'm trying to round up folks on MuWire. It's all set to have a ball rolling (though I don't like how centralized the chat features are: too local).

eiskaltdcpp-qt on passive inbound and socks5 through tor outbound (wildly imperfect, I realize) connected to every public hub I can find burns 100% CPU, sustained. Hubcount limits make little sense to me.

//Kushiel's Dart// @ C30:00:20. I have no idea what time I fell asleep. 

Woke at 1? It was enough. Hugs'n'bugs for everyone. Mi amor was sleepy, so put her down for a nap. [[TTTOTW]]. 

Mi amor had a minor anxiety attack, and we have no idea why. Soothed.

[[Family Time]] was smooth and even quiet. There wasn't as much ground to cover this week (fewer people writing). Vapelyfe. Talked with my son some more about [[Links: Library]]. 

We watched the first episode of //Sherlock//. Everyone is a fan. =D.

Dadnap. Woke very late. Excellent sleep. Made sure my daughter remembered what her duties were for the next day (sleep well!).

Pushed brix. Chips'n'dip + SC2. [[TTTOTW]].

[[TTTOTW]] with [[ASK]] eating her noods and cheese. Put my daughter to bed at 3. She has shit to do tomorrow, and she knows it. Snacks + Vapelyfe + [[TTTOTW]]. Hard pushing tonight. Checking out if I could unload 3k tabs into Opera. Unlikely, as it's just too much RAM all at once (need to load suspended). Ultimately, the best option is to have digested them. 

Cleaned up connection keys for [[Contact]]. Narrowed more of the DC++ hubs down to those that accept proxies, including tor exits; you get my patronage and skin in the game to boot (since I think the performance difference is horrific). Still want personal snapshotting (probably safe to go weekly) before Zeronet work (probably add hypers and a full read-only resilio sync from the top level). 

Fireman Time! The toy lives. I'm still off.

Leftovers + Water + SC2. 

[[5c0ut]] called me up. He needed an adult to talk to so it wouldn't spill over. I gotchu. Venting about not receiving his paycheck on time, feeling blamed for being poor (I have a lot of thoughts on that one), continues to tell me about his evil boss (`/nod`). A quick catch up. [[TTTOTW]].

Mi amor was still asleep at 10. Went to sleep myself.

Woke at 3? Meditation. //Skintime// with [[ASK]]. Hugs'n'bugs. Assignments. Lots of chores need to be done correctly. Basement tooling needs to be set. Eventually, one day, we'll have enough for the workbenchs and shed; until then, we'll keep it as neat as we can. [[Morning Routine]].

Mi amor wrote a worrisome [[poem]]; we're still searching for a title. Just chillin' and media for her today. //Raw Skintime//. //Inform the Men!// Shower of the gods!

[[TTTOTW]]. 

Shopping @ W-Entity with mi amor. Went just for cat litter, but I got some cheap t-shirts (I'm running low), and we got a few other missing pieces (found two fuzzy sweater things for her, dirt cheap).

[[TTTOTW]].

//Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl//. We had [[ASK]]'s pasta bake with italian sausage. Delicious. I had part of a sour candy cane too. Comfy on my bed, and fell asleep. Apparently, it's official: my bed is absolute garbage. Dadnap hard.

Woke at 11? //Raw Skintime// with [[ASK]]. Hugs'n'bugs with folks. [[TTTOTW]].
