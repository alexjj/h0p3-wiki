; 2022.06.06 - Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden: Tomatoes

* We took too long to transplant the tomatoes, so some might die. We'll see. They may grow into big vines on the gazebo. We'll see.

; 2022.06.04 - Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden: Useful Plants

* Our planted yaupon didn't make it through the winter, and so we're going to be even more careful, and just do potted yaupon bushes. Transplanted, with good soil. 
* Our aloe plant has grown too much. Much bigger pot for it now. 
* Rest of the garden is just getting watered. Some are lookin' pretty good.

; 2022.05.09 - Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden: Out

* 4 Tubs of watermelon seedlings (of 5 types), the peppers, and many herbs have been placed outside on the mulch. Watered. May they receive tons of sunlight.

; 2022.05.01 - Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden: Oops

* Watering, uncovering, and preparing to set the objects in the back tomorrow.
* Unfortunately, the tomatoes died, again. We're not going to use the nursery. We're just going to plant them straight. Hopefully, no more cold weather for a while.

; 2022.04.23 - Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden: Transplantation

* Opened our piles of dirt and made a deep bed for our various hot peppers. We only need 8-16 to survive, but there are 40 or so for our psychopathic gardening.
* [[ASK]] is concerned we haven't been keeping them as moist as she'd like.

; 2022.04.18 - Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden: Spring Cleaning

* Moar drilling. 
* We've planted 5 types of watermelon, hoping something sticks. We won't be planting any of it in the ground. It will all be above the ground in planters.
* Planted chives and cilantro. 
* Transplanted our thyme and rosemary. It's not clear they will all survive, but here's hoping. 
* Cleaned the yard, basic organization of our containers. 
* Willow repositioned and watered.
* Plastic wrapped for greenhouse, and had to tie it off as well.

; 2022.04.11 - Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden: New Tomatoes

* Drilled holes in our containers. Can always drill more, so we didn't do a ton.
* Transfering dirt. Smells good. 
** We need to get the right kind for mi amor's plant.
* Tomatoes, unfortunately, are largely dead. A major freeze in our basement took most of them. We really started too early. 
** We have many more seeds left though. Going for another plant. May they shoot up fast again! =)
* Peppers look amazing. I hope it warms up enough that we don't have any more frosts. 

; 2022.03.20 - Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden: Weeping Pussy Willow

* As the [[title.Title]] suggests, [[ASK]] acquired a new tree (it may already be 70% of its final size). I know nothing about it, but it looks interesting. She's stoked about it. (Dope, that's more than I could ask for). Not sure where it will be planted. 
* We've acquired walking/stepping stones, and we're considering terracing the side of that hill.
* Checked out sheds. Gotdayum that shit is expensive.
* Haberno peppers aint sprouted yet, but the cayenne are finally here!

; 2022.03.15 - Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden: Maters

* The tomato plants are looking good. We took off the greenhouse lid because they are too tall now. I hope it won't be too cold for them still. I have no idea how we are going to choose between them.

; 2022.03.12 - Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden: First Signs

* Both types of tomatoes, A and B, have sprouted. Tiny, hard to see, thin, frail things, 10 feet from snow. 
* [[ASK]] is unconcerned about our timetable (seems early to me) given how we'll be capable of modularly transporting the plants. 
** She smart.

; 2022.03.03 - Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden: Psychopathic Gardening

* Talked, tasted, and made a nursery with our compressed dirt. 10 minutes, she says. :P
* 60 cayenne pepper plants, 12 habanero, and a mixture of different campari tomato strains, 72 plants. 
** Spent time cutting strips of TP with the seeds attached.
* Spritzed. It's cold, and, given the snow outside, it seems so weird to think that in a few weeks we'll want to plant these outdoors. 
* The goal is to replant only a small percentage of these seedlings and either destroy, give away, or yolo plant elsewhere the remainder of weaklings. May only the strong survive on her terms. =).

; 2022.02.28 - Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden: Afresh

* [[ASK]] and I picked up cheap, sturdy containers to grow the garden above ground. Indeterminate tomato vines and peppers (that she can have, since she'll know they have been ripened enough). Not sure what else we'll do, but that would help quite a bit.

; 2021.05.15 - Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden: A Danger

* Picked up glyphosate weedkiller for the japanese knotweed, and this may be a problem for the entire yard (which is small), including our garden plants. We have to get rid of this for the sake of the house. The other options are far more expensive.

; 2021.05.14 - Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden: RIP Yaupon

* Final planting for the season. Just small shit. Getting our feet wet. 
* Unfortunately, for the second year in a row, our Yaupon seeds didn't germinate. We need cuttings. 

; 2021.05.11 - Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden: Yard

* We have a weedeater now. Offspring still learning how to use our tools. Corded is a pain in the ass too. The engines are much weaker than gas-powered, but they'll do. 

; 2021.05.08 - Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden: In The Ground

* First nursery has been launched. Let's just see what happens. Could be nothing. If it fails this year, we'll try again. This is a cheap experiment to run multiple times.
* Raining a lot, so no need to water.

; 2021.05.06 - Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden: Moar Planting

* Nursery Greenhouses have some sprouts. =D. 
* Two pawpaw trees within 30 feet of each other (should improve the odds of actually fruiting). Considered alongside the house, but we'll wait to do anything there.
** Eventually, we hope to have a significant shed (I'd like one I could sleep in, and I'd run power out there). Trying to arrange trees so that it won't get in the way of that. Our yard is small (at least by a Kentuckian's foolish standard), and I'm glad. Something to take care of without it being some absurd burden, I hope. 
*** Eventually, eventually, I'd like to have a projection screen on the shed. I don't care about a firepit, but maybe people want that. 
* The berry bushes we planted last year are ready, so we planted those alongside the others. 
* Our grapevine is not dead, it's growing. We aren't going to plant it yet though. Just let it sit in the large green vessel for now. Couldn't find a place we adored.

; 2021.04.27 - Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden: Planting

* Planted a rose bush in the front. Probably just going to be a hodge podge. 
* Began our nursery with my offspring, and they were into it this time. =). 
** Cilantro, yaupon, two kinds of tomatoes, watermelon, celery, various peppers, and some others. 
* Set up our watering, and found out the water pressure on our outlet isn't great. 
* Weeding and watering. It doesn't looking pretty, but maybe in a few years we'll have something, eh?

; 2021.04.24 - Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden: Bushwhack

* Actually looked at this plot of land that is temporarily ours to use for a few decades before we die. Maybe we can grow things we like on it. 
* Picked up 2x72 indoor nursery greenhouse
* Still have the old seeds, but also grabbed catnip, cilantro (my bro uses it in everything), and my wife peas. Waiting on the Blacktail Mountain Watermelon seeds to come in before I do anything. 
* We have many raspberry bushes full-grown already, and we're planting more blackberry and raspberry bushes. Our neighbor's little child picks them too, so we'll try to make too many. 
* We've got little cages (not meant for that, but they are flexible enough to become circles) to protect the 3 sprouting trees we'll be planting soon enough. 
* Mowed the lawn. It's not the thick, unstoppable bluegrass of Kentucky. I don't mind one bit, though I'm worried that it means our garden will fail.

; 2021.04.19 - Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden: Why Not?

* Absolute failure last time. I don't feel so bad. It was not meant to grow anything except moss. Still, I hate when projects fail. No reason not to try again here though. Going to be more targeted, slower. It's not an emergency and it's less about teaching anything now. I tell you what I never have enough of: watermelon. I want to eat it every day. It's like pizza to me, a good rice-based dish, and so forth. It has "water" in the name, so it //has// to be good for you.
** Blacktail Mountain Watermelon seeds purchased.
*** 8", if you harvest just before they ripen, they will finish off in storage and keep for up to 2 months, pickleable rind. 
*** Soil Temp. for Germination: 70-85° F
*** Days to Germination: 3-10
*** Days to Maturity: 70-75 
** Electric mower acquired.

; 2020.05.14 - Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden: Planting

* More planting. Offspring handled all of it.

; 2020.05.13 - Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden: Planting

* My son and I did the hard labor. We tilled the rocky soil again.
** Our neighbor, June, called us from her window to offer us her hoe. She told us the soil will probably not grow anything (as she had to import soil, and was considering doing even more) to grow what she had. She might be right. We'll do what we can.
*** Even if it all fails, it was a useful project for my offspring to experience. 
* My daughter sorted the nursery.
* Both my offspring planted about half of what we had.
** The good news is that we will be able to plant even more. 

; 2020.05.04 - Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden: Hardening, Planting, Prep

* Our nursery has been pretty decent. We've begun the process of hardening them (going to increment up).
** Unfortunately, it doesn't appear the watermelon is going to grow. ^^NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!^^...correction, folx just checked, and some made it. Sweet, sweet watermelon. Lawd, please grow. I want to bury my face in melons all day, erryday. `/motorboat` for them juices.<<ref "a">>
* It was going to start to rain according to my wife, so we didn't get to everything we wanted (pansies).
* I'm still raking rocks out of the major section of the garden and loosening the dirt up. 
** It's gonna be one ghetto garden, itellyawhat
* Blackberry, Grape, Blueberry, and Raspberry plants have been potted in 10gal rubber pots (like them handles too).
** Set up poles for the grapes to latch onto. Prolly won't work, but I'm glad we are trying. 
* Porch has been organized and cleaned. 
** People took pictures. Losers. =)

; 2020.04.25 - Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden: Another Tray

* Yaupon seeds came in, so they were started.
** Melon and others were used up. No reason to waste a thing here.
* Offspring's trays are getting too tall for the mini-greenhouse. We need to transplant soon.

; 2020.04.22 - Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden: Sprouts

* Mesclun starting shooting up in 24 hours. There's a [[hope]]ful green in our tiny greenhouses.
* Setting up the mobile units, bushes, etc.

** Whoever did the wiring of this place just mailed it in, I tellyawhat.

; 2020.04.16 - Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden: Avoiding Ze Frost

* Jiffy indoor nursery greenhouse 4x75 (just going to use half for now) and handtools acquired.
* Worried about CT coldsnaps, and so we're thinking about starting more of the plants indoors than seems normal to a simp Kentuhcky boi.
* Organizing seeds and writing out little placards. 

; 2020.04.15 - Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden: Planning

* Some basic tools, more seeds, and soil for the potted bushes acquired.
* Offspring and I thought more about how we could maximize the tiny plot of land we have available to us.
** We have to make sure people cannot easily complain about being unable to walk through the area, and we prefer to keepz it hidden to some degree.
** It probably won't be pretty (and it may not even work at all).

; 2020.04.14 - Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden: Yaupon

* Wife ordered yaupon holly seeds.
* Picked up dirt cheap 10-gallon rubber-plastic pots.
* We're trying to narrow down the mobile plant units to special things my wife would care for. 
** Can't guarantee we will be allowed to keep a garden or that we will be here in 9 months. 

; 2020.03.31 - Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden: Heirloom Seeds

* Bought a variety pack of heirloom seeds, but unknown when it will arrive (logistics problems everywhere).
