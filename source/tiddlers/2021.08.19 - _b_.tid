For the record, if "I have 24 hours with you, and you couldn't say no," and you're hawt to me (and all the other side-constraints are met), we're going to fuck a lot (we'll be fuckpigs together), I'm going hold you while you pee, we'll talk philosophy, make many disgusting jokes, and we'll fuck a lot. [[That's what people do|https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/77759eb4-069d-4cdd-8747-f9cb708678a3]].

Perhaps: the fundamental concepts of math: adjointness, logic, inverses, units, factorizations, graphs.

Everything has an order and must be used exactly once, if you seek certain safety.

Mathematics performed by the [[fff]] is conceptually inconsistent and subjective in some respects, though that does not imply there is no realism or objectivity, nor that it isn't practical, robust, or reliable for we mere mortals. Mathematics as an inconsistent theory for us (beyond even the paradoxes arising from the exchange rule and self-referentiality) can be reduced to a consistent one by introducing order.

<br>

It is usually better to begin with order than disorder and gradually relax strict ordering constraints (for performance) where you can prove correctness, instead of starting with an unordered or disordered system and gradually try to impose order on it.

Perhaps, to some [[dok]], space is an emergent product of symmetries that consist of internal relations that change. If observations in quantum physics leads to coherence, there seems to be a relationship between a locality of space and the phenomena. It's not just relative to a point in space, but across a local region.
