I'm going to keep saying it, even though no one with significant [[power]] is going to listen (because they don't want such an economy): Proof of Stake, like any economy, will tend to centralize [[power]], but we can build blockchains that have continual patterned redistribution; at which point, that is the most energy efficient form of voting I can find in many cases.

Imagine culturally appropriating the theory of cultural appropriation such that it's not about how an oppressor criminalizes and then adds insult to injury by commodifying an oppressed culture with no restorative justice, sweeping exploitation under the rug, but rather about attacking people for freely using (which does not mean without moral constraint) or sharing culture (a word I dare any of you to define with me) while hypocritically engaging in the same behavior themselves. If your concern is a supposed intellectual property violation, you're part of the problem. I often find this concept a red herring, like people haven't correctly identified what is actually wrong. That should give [[pleft]]ists serious [[pause]], at least in delivery and prioritizing rhetoric.

''''#oFfMyChesT: Yeah, let's totally normalize not talking to anyone for any reason (like a pretend universal headphone rule). How dare you expect a stranger should have a right to my time, ever! Can't I be in public or on the planet as though it were my private domain? What's a guy gotta do to not be accosted by someone saying "hello"? You've objectified me when you make me feel uncomfortable, and it's your fault when you don't silently walk on eggshells around me. What kind of commie scum are you that you think you have any morally justified political right to my body or mind?

I will dehumanize you if your body count is between 0 and 9000. Most people are cringe. Anything Over 9k, however, makes you a good person who has created enough space between you and inceldom to have achieved at least a modicum of dignity through your legendary boinking.
