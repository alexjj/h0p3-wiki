title: 2021.08.31 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: need ₥oral support

Cleaning. Footbath + Sourdough w/CC + [[TTTOTW]]. Some prep for dinner. Sleep by 2:30. Woke at 9? Solid. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Dadnap. Woke at 3:30. Making up for a shit night of sleep. I felt excellent afterward. Canvassing. Began ribs. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman time! [[TTTOTW]].

Continued difficult discussions with my offspring. My cards have been handed to me. Alrighty. I tell them the truth, and it's up to them what they do with it. It sucks watching them make huge mistakes. I cannot simulate all the consequences, and at this point, I'm required not to. Maybe it will make a difference long-term though. You'll get the best answer I have, take it or leave it, I'll still give you the best answer I have (often not much of an answer, I realize). They're capable of knowing what I think anyway. And, these are recoverable mistakes, but the odds get worse and the ceilings drop. If they want to learn, they can. I have much to learn from my youngest [[Root Users]].

//The Walk// with my offspring was excellent. We didn't get to speak about my daughter's schoolwork almost at all. My son had read the graphic novel version of [[Dune]], and now has finished the novel. Vapelyfe. Minus the inescapable tangents, that's all we talked about. Thought about paper topics, walking through the process and examples. My son was upset right before we hit the circle, but he shrugged it off. It was mostly pleasant to have my daughter join us there (filling in some gaps), but, at this point, she takes her goal to be to negate (primarily through thought terminators, not actual discourse) nearly everything I say, even in bad faith, because it's funny. She's a piercing troll sometimes, and it's a good thing she's funny and that we need to hear her opinion. We've see some very brightly colored birds lately. 

She was waiting on me. :P. SZ dodged today, and A handed my wife the power to fix the security problem (showering praise on her communications, as usual...well deserved). It was much smoother after being handed the reins (80% her problem, but given ~100% power to fix it). The outside group was happy to deal with her exact requirements (just needed a point person with an understanding of a mutually acceptable vision, I guess). The informal e-mail contracts go out soon (good luck, J; you're next on my list). C asked her to handle a technical J problem, but it really wasn't her bailiwick (not her circus, not her monkeys; handed the proof and then direction). Movers came, she directed, and she received many compliments on the new look and function of the big room ([[Gary]] opened my eyes to how crucial that problem is...she still uses several of his strategies). And, her gift to her students made it up the foodchain to B (no idea how she found out, maybe secretary) who wants one as well (her pragmatism pays again). She's in a good mood today. //Inform the Men!// I am beyond sensitive with Δ⁸ - too much (but I'm glad).

Shower of the gods! I've been looking at jobs again. Nothing I'm convinced is fitting. The fun one I can't justify. Although, I enjoy aspects of working with younger people. I also am not convinced it's the best use of my time. Crazy person writing in his basement on the hail mary play still seems the wisest option. 

[[Family Gathering]] was excellent. My offspring cooked a great meal. Ribs and wedges were made well, and we had quick pickle chunks and watermelon too. We scarfed it down, although my son had less than usual.<<ref "i">> //House//. My son's autistic laugh is poyfect, and my daughter anticipating lines before they are said as her mother does (makes the adults laugh because we know what line is about to be said).

She's heading to bed early. At least she'll be home early and before rush hour. Interesting to see that her predecessor and immediate super also preferred having that extra hour in the morning (the convergence seems unlikely to be an accident; looks more optimal to me). I'm hoping it will buy her a great deal. Oh, and class begins. =).

Took a shit. [[TTTOTW]] + leftovers.
