; 570-490 BC: Pythagoras

* Our immortal souls temporarily reside in the brain. We are reincarnated through metempsychosis, transmigrating into another living thing when we die, yet still remembering what we knew from our previous lives.
* Mathematics, music, and philosophy can purify the soul, freeing it from the otherwise unceasing process of metempsychosis.
* Mathematics is the basis of everything, providing an explanation of a beautiful order of reality beyond the will of the capricious gods puppeted by sophists.
** Numbers have their own personalities, characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses.
** Hypocritically, the likely-synesthesiac mystic-mathematician controlled his gnostic [[cult]], purposely limiting who could experience the freedom of reason.
