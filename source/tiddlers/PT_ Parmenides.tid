; 515-460 BC: Parmenides

* Multiplicity, change, contingency, the being of non-being, duality, and mere opinions and observations about these are illusions; there is only a perfect, immutable, totalitizing, unconditional, necessary, monadic singularity that is henotic reality. All is one, [[ITS]].
* There is no distinction between subject and object; //thinking// and that //because of which there is thinking// are the same thing. Insofar as thinking requires the appearance of change, it's an illusion.
* In some paradoxical respect, it is morally and modally necessary to learn all things, both the true nature of reality and the opinions of mortals (including Parmenides') that point toward what appears to be referent that doesn't obtain.
