Kids are startups with massive carbon footprints. Surely, these parasites are among the worst things the average first-worlder can inflict upon the environment.

Yeah, I am concerned that the only people you've ever loved more than yourself have abused you.

It feels like I see more #stopasianhate ideological signaling from corporations that have heavy Chinese investment, and, of course, I could be wrong. I'm also open to false flag claims (I'm aware that the US military-industrial-complex has long been the most dangerous offender).

Disabuse yourselves of the notion that our market is a meritocracy of anything beyond pyramid signaling. Lacking privilege may produce low-confidence in self-realization and ineffective practice in perceiving the true nature of the game that is played [[FTSO]] [[power]]. The bourgeoisie have the additional advantage of what is functionally a self-fulfilling prosperity-gospel prophesy, where their signals of confidence and feelings of entitlement are far more likely to be recognized and rewarded than their actual competence. Proletarian imposter syndrome is perhaps often a conflation of one's lack of confidence in competency with not having internalized the vast performative significance of psychopathic signaling in the market. The habituated positivistically virtuous ability to lie boldly and be rewarded for it is a key outcome of privilege, and that dishonesty incentive is in part why there are radically lower levels of golden-ruled empathy among the elite.

Hrm. I'm not saying I do this well enough, but one of my favorite parts of being a high-functioning autistic 4eak is that I get to show people what it means to be functionally autistic with respect to me. I've often taken the time to generalize about your rTPJ activations and mentalizations a lot more than you have mine, and I have some practice recognizing the difficulty of taking up my perspective from neurotypical contexts. One of my goals is to invert that mind-blindness in our joint attention, to flip the asymmetry in the theory of mind development in our practice. It actually teaches some empathy in hard places. It's a difference, not necessarily a disorder, and that deviance is largely a circumstantial matter. Bayesian autism comes in many [[dok]]. I hope we can fairly practice our social attention coordination strategies together, even from the infancy of our relationship. Your propositions are always the lowest hanging fruit for me.
