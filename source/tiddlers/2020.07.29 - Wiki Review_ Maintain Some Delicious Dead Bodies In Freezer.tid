title: 2020.07.29 - Wiki Review: Maintain Some Delicious Dead Bodies In Freezer

* [[Whirlwind]]
** Me and the world.
* [[2020.07.28 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Trigger Discipline]]
** While I think the PCM sub lacks integrity, sufficient idealogical turing testing, and careful analysis (I mean, that's the usual anywhere): they do a fine job of lampooning and crystallizing common perspectives.

** Okay, I don't want the entire thing. I have to sift. I have to more jealously guard the size of the wiki too. 10MB a year might still put this tool out of business sooner than I'd like. I still don't know how it will scale up (and that's because I still don't know how I'm going to use it).
** You had a productive day even though it wasn't the one you predicted. 
* [[2020.07.28 - Wiki Review: Terrorboredom]]
** Completed. Plus, they've had plenty of transitions and brain-melting stress this year too. Heal up.
*** It's not like any other student would put up with you, lol.
* [[2020.07.28 - Prompted Introspection: Self-Construing Disposition]]
** Completed. Self-construing about that self-construing. 
** I need to figure out how I could possibly be more pretentious, dark-triadic, emo, etc. Lol. It is what it is.
* [[2020.07.28 - h0p3ful Review: Honest Analysis]]
** Slowly, he makes improvements. Who knows who he'll be two years from now? There are places he can see more clearly than his sister already, or least his blindness is something I respect highly.
* [[2020.07.28 - h0p3ful Review: Time Doesn't Pass In Our Home]]
** Reminds me of a conference in which the mystics were jovial and the analytics at each others' throats. Of course, I think analytics are the only people that can make verifiable progress.
* [[The Lacanthropist]]
** I suppose I'll have to respond to him eventually. We have a fuckton of commonground too.
