title: 2020.12.17 - Prompted Introspection: Killing

!! Which have you planned in greater detail: killing yourself, or killing someone else?

I don't know. I've researched and planned both in detail. I've spoken about suicide plenty, but I don't speak as much about homocide. Most people have visualized killing someone, but planning (and even practicing for) such an event is different. It turns my stomach, but I agree that there is a justified us vs. them in the world (and one that we are all responsible for). I am not happy about my prediction, but I believe I will eventually do both.<<ref "o">> [[Gradual]]ized [[T42T]] in capitalism requires it. I'm harmless with most people, or at least I try to be a scalpel. I'm certainly not a badass; I'm lazy and cowardly even.<<ref "i">> I have, however, experienced plenty of violence, and I've got the amygdalic scars that incline me to violence too. I know some people don't believe I have that in me, but those who have known me for at least a decade both tend to take my words about my actions seriously (even [[BL]] responded with "much trepidation," and I'm going to wait for another possible response from him) and also know my hate is real. I [[aim]] to be judicious and even prudent with my zeal and violence. I'd rather reason (itself a form of lesser violence in many contexts), and I'd rather just lose myself in hedonic pursuits too. [[Justice]] is expensive. 

Maybe I will chill out. Some percentage of schizos do. I'd [[like]] that. There is a chance that I just drift off or even become converted by anti-realists (openness of [[Question Everything]] is demands the possibility). That would be pleasant.
