That's my doggo. He isn't chain. He just wearing his leash. Put camera on and practiced. He did well. Was not a success every time. Beautiful maple in my front yard though. Had to enjoy it for a bit that day. Good wear her for it. And that video clip is what I condensed a small portion of our play time to.
It's currently annoyunf point between my wife and child and I.
Beautiful doggo.
The dog adores me and will do what ever I want. And they don't get the same respect or fun and are slightly afraid of him.
`/nod`
I assume walkin him is good exercise.
Can't seem to ever get enough walks in
I don't walk him! Lol. I usually play fetch with him.
Type of walk, I suppose.
I get a workout in the food truck.  ðŸ’ª
What kinds of food do you make?
Burgers, Phillys, hot dogs, fries lots of different fried foods. Known for the catfish.
Noice
Gonna be master of many trades by the time you get old
Out of boredom.
Lol. I appriciate the experience. I mean. My last job was washing dishes again at the local mellow mushroom for about 6 months. Closing 4 nights every weekend night.
For $8.
It was insane. I lost 40lbs.
And made sure to stay extremely high on thc the entire time I worked. Kept me from getting stressed on a sat nuhht some nights cruise night.
Lol
I'd have a hard time losing weight at that place, lol.
Being able to grind while high is dope
I didn't eat any food from there. That was my rule.
Makes sense.
Some grow to hate it too much then
I do not have the kind of discipline
Helps that I have a retainer with a fake front tooth. I have to take it out to eat.
I'm a little self conscious about it. I can be.
I hear ya. People aren't very nice or rational about appearances.
I can see you enjoying not giving a shit as a very old man though.
I have all the expensive stuff done. Just not thr $500 tooth.
Reminds me that we need to get to dentists here soon
I have the stud. The bone graft. The 5k of dental done. But I had to wear the retainer the whole time during healing. Which was. Like 3 procedures and offer like 10 months.
Over*
