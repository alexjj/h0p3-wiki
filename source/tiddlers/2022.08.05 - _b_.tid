I will pee on you so that you will be accepted into our pack-clan-tribe.

Hypocritically, I don't like being a teacher because I'm not effective at convincing students to learn in spite of themselves.

<br>

wheely tired today; in a W-entity parking lot emotionally; if you hug me for too long, i'll cry

Conversations grow shorter.
Fading into shared silence.
The wall of despair goes up.
Are we back to being strangers?

No.
Still real,
still here,
even in the rubble.

I love you to the end, 
all the way down,
through thick and thin, 
wherever you are, 
whoever you are.
