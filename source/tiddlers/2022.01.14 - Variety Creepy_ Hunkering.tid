> Sorry for making this response so late. We went into a covid curfew and stuff and now I’m stuck with online classes(for the good). Also, I fell into a bout of sadness(I Don’t want to use depression!) and a bit of suicidal ideation. Sorry, I couldn’t reply because of that

No worries, sir. You've been ridiculously busy in the middle of a crisis. Take your time, please. I [[hope]] you're able to keep your spirits high while locked away. Despite how much learning I do online, I feel bad that people are forced to do so. Hard to beat the vulnerability of being there in the flesh [[telling stories|2020.09.13 - Prompted Introspection: Like This One]] (even of the engineering variety) with your class together. I'd fall into a bout of sadness too.

> I’m responding to the message now!

মহা ধন্যবাদ. It's always my honor to hear from you, homie.

> It has hit everywhere and really hard! Omicron is a monster! That is good. I hope you have gotten your booster by now. 

The peak number keeps climbing, even today (though it appears to be dropping in my New England region perhaps). I haven't gotten my booster yet. Locally, we've not experienced the same degree of logistical problems that many places have yet, but perhaps that will occur. 

How early is curfew? Have things tightened up much further on this wave? What's it like for you and other people you know?

> I don’t mind writing letters. But I would prefer if it was an email instead

I prefer e-mail to chat as well. I'll still be writing from the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱.

> But you are right. Time zone differences make it hard to socialise on the internet.

[[lg.]] was just trying to demonstrate that more clearly to me as well. Asynchronicity doesn't feel sufficient in many cases. 

> I am scared of running into someone I know on dating apps because it would make it awkward. For both of us, and I hate to admit that I need an app to find a girlfriend and I couldn’t do it the regular way

I'm sorry that it would be awkward. I could imagine there are some cases where it would also be kinda neat to run into someone I know on a dating app. 

What would be a more regular way for you? 

> I don’t mind tox or emails.

Well, I'm hoping you switch over in your future [[contact]] with me.

> My family did it as a team. Still not completely adjusted to the house, but yes, we are fairly settled here

I have to admit: given your family's wealth, it is surprising to me that your family performed the physical labor. I [[like]] that you did. 

I've found it takes at least a year to feel somewhat settled. I've never lived in a place for more than 6 years straight, so I don't know enough about this process. 

Will you eventually be living on your own in one of these houses?

> The rent was high because it was in the middle of the city. There is a demand for the houses there because it has everything close to it.

Being in walking distance of everything you need is dope AF. Having to travel 30 kilometers just to do a basic thing sucks. Those things add up, take too much time and money.

> The name is Mesut. We might change it soon.

I looked that [[name]] up. Seems like a good one for a doggo. Is the dog keeping you company?

> No, my parents own have multiple houses in Bangalore. It’s just that they are not in the place where we need. My college is in the South West part of the city. We moved to the south west because of that.

That is quite a privilege. I think it's [[awe]]some that your family would move just for you to engage in this project. 

> We have houses/apartments in the South East, centre, North East, and planning to buy in the north west.

Why the north west?
