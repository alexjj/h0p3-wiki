Woke at 5? Meh. Not great (I blame the rum and the idiot who drank it :P), but can't get back to sleep. [[TTTOTW]]. [[ASK]]ing. That girl has not slept well at all. She's going all out, manic hard. 

She's up. Hugs'n'bugs. She slept too, thankfully. Cheerful even this morning. Confirmed for my daughter that she is not required to attend church. Talked some with [[T-Money]]. Son made good on his word to make sure I was up too (gracias, sir). Got stuff together and traveled. 

Been a while since I drove seriously. New York is gorgeous. It is not the worst city to drive-in (everyone was sufficiently polite, surprisingly), but it takes as long to get to the city limits as it does to navigate anywhere in the city itself. Picked up Madame [[chameleon]]. Hugs. We both had our worry beads. Found the hotel, a great parking spot, and then we wandered. Found a pizza place and some dranks. Excellent pizza, some candy, and a game of magic: Her gobbos +1 vs UR Delver. Mountain->Vial, Mountain, Fetch->Shock->Guide, Mountain->Chief->Daze, Island->Mancer (second whiff for her), Mogg->Incinerator to wipe my board->Clamp->Daze (and I'm stuck with SPierce, bolt, land, and rift), land, Leader for gas into driver and jiki into scoop, gg. She demolished me. Went back to the car, nearly lost my beads (but they were exactly where I put them last, of course), got some coffee and talked until check-in. Hugs, and headed out. Drive back kinda sucked; rush-hour traffic made it significantly denser and the trip longer. Very glad I got to see her.

[[ASK]]ing. [[Family Time]] opened with serious discussions with my offspring. They had work to show, and I argued with my daughter about her writing (and the gap between what she'll argue verbally and what she'll write). Thought more with my son about what his project should be. Archiving sounds like an interesting one, no doubt. They had already done the log, so we just read. Missed call from my brother [[JRE]], but wasn't in a position to call back tonight.

We watched //Star Trek: First Contact// after significant context was provided (probably half an hour, at least). [[ASK]]ing and finishing up my part of the [[Family Log]]. 

As promised, I took my offspring to DQ. I can't recall when they've been there last: many years. I had my try my parfait, so they at least know the classic. My son got the cookie dough blizzard (good call), and my daughter this newfangled cheesecake. 

Put folks to bed. Got gas for m'theydy because she called me, and, I quote, "an asshole." =D. Fireman Time!<<ref "c">> [[TTTOTW]]. [[ASK]]ing.

Fuck me: [[m14]] is literally unable to boot beyond maybe drive decryption. Not even attempting TWRP: looks like a brick to me. Fuck. Was just talking with [[chameleon]] about this. `/sigh`. Alright. 5-6 years out of a phone is completely reasonable. The [[Pinephone]] cannot run software I have to have to authenticate with the world for a number of reasons. Dropped 250 on [[m14]], 30 for protection extras, ~50? for repairs over the life of it. Oneplus 8 refurb otw, 260, 20 protection extras. 6x the singlethreaded IPS (shockingly close to [[m16]]), jumping from 3 to 8 gigs of RAM, and even the hard drive bump to UFS and 4 times the space, and, yeah, gfx and camera won't be potato either. [[Root]] and another go at LineageOS for the umpteenth year. May I get another 5-6 out this bastard. First time I've had a phone that's arguably stronger than my laptop, and there are benchmarks were it actually beats [[m16]]. What a world to live in. Sleep by 1?

Woke at 7:30. [[TTTOTW]]. 

We reworked the pantry area (we have enough milk and honey [noodles and rice too] to last us for a long time), and my daughter has found a junkyard paying quite well (Wednesday). I'm moving the catbox slowly toward the utility corner of [[The Den]]. We made lentil soup together, and I made quesadillas. We watched about the history of Minecraft. The garage area was cleaned out, preparing for making a room in there. We still have a ways to go. I'll need to ask Scott again (perhaps it is better if [[k0sh3k]] gives it a shot).

Dadnap. //TableTime// was over. Went straight into food, since everyone was hovering the soup. [[Family Gathering]] was early today. We had lentil soup and watched the gold poisoning episode of //House//. //Skintime//. //Raw Skintime// as she talked about her day. She's feeling negative today. We watched two episodes of //Midnight Mass//. I think it's a sad show for her in the ned.  

[[ASK]]ing and chat with [[T-Money]]. [[TTTOTW]] + LolWorlds. Fireman Time! Leftovers + Wine.
