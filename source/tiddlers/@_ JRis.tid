; 2021.04.11 - JRis: Whoa! This is awesome.

OMG, it's fucking you! DUDE! I am beside myself with excitement to connect with you again. I wish I knew how to explain what your words meant to me nor what even mine to you meant to me either. You gave me a lot to think about with even just a few extremely thoughtful and kind words. It's both a pleasure and an honor to have met someone as honest and empathic as you. Like [[Tapeda the Dragon]], you have been a quiet [[Root User]]-like senpai in my life, guiding me without even my knowledge of it.  You are a philosopher, sir. You lead the blind. Thank you. I'm extremely [[lucky]] to meet you. Thank you for meeting me again! I don't even know where to begin, but I'm happy to begin again.
