* 5/5
** It's legal ^^for now™^^, my ninjas.
** Indeed, it appears to have a weaker-than-9 yet unique and potent set of physical, cognitive, visual, and auditory effects. 
*** I find it plenty strong for me, but I'm fairly sensitive in my experience.<<ref "d">>
** After discount and shipping, $90 for ~28g of 88% Δ⁸ THC. There's at least a few hundred hits in this (maybe even a thousand for some folks). I am //astonished//. 
*** Only some RCs are that price-efficient. In a way, it's so cheap that it's less a consumable and more like a long-term tool.<<ref "m">>
**** We'll just call it "wear and tear" on a tool that you'll eventually use-up. There are plenty of tools that I'd be satisfied to get even a few hundreds uses out of.
*** I cannot speak to tolerance build-up from this substance yet (I've read stories of ridiculous tolerances, but I can't confirm that personally).
** No decarboxylation, fancy chemistry tek, or further prep necessary. Chip off the ol' heavenly block a tiny scraping and swallow it.
*** You can heat it up and make it workable for many other preparations, of course. 
*** This is a highly-compact, well-preserved edible. `/chef's-kiss`
**** ~~Sure, you can vape this, but y tho?~~ Quite pleasant, easy to dial in your vapes.
**** I wouldn't attempt to chew it though unless it were copiously cut with gum.
**** I say this as a person who is lazy and happy enough to just take small bits of [[cannabutter|Recipe: Cannabutter]] straight: Δ⁸ distillate is far simpler.
* Were I in this business, I'd consider manufacturing them in small pills/pellets/grains/shards/dabs. 25mgs a piece (indeed, those would be tiny).
** Could just be in ribbons/shreds/shavings too. 
** I don't know how well they travel, so maybe they'd need wax-paper sheets or some other more clever method (legos, my dude).
** Fuck Altoids, a box of these would get your large church or school or [[Magic]]: The Gathering Grand Prix (maybe I could win one some day with this strategy) or small town high AF for the evening.<<ref "o">> 
** I realize we're in volumetric dosing territory; some people would ignore the label you slapped on such a container.<<ref "a">>
** I think a Jawbreaker^^tm^^ or even a dildo would be hilarious (if feasible).
* I kinda feel like I've wandered around in a simulated game world and found a treasure or magic crystal kept in a tiny cannister<<ref "t">> that I'll keep in my pocket for the rest of my quest. Thank you, [[Galadriel|Hope]]!
** I also kinda understand crackrocks now, Sir Tyrone Biggums.
** If I were forced to live on an island by myself, among the objects I would hope to bring would be a backpack of these (it would be a lifetime supply, Gilligan).
* Where is the "Legally Hemp" CBD distillate at this price? `/shakes-you` ''SHOW ME, GODDAMNIT''!
