To what degree do you align with the bourgeoisie because of your position of power and control even if you don't own the means of production and still work for a living? There are many unobvious processes in our lives like this. Insofar as owning or renting a home from a bank tied to US monetary policy (packaged in surprisingly complex financial instruments, no doubt) is a source of capital, the criminalization of housing-insecurity (including various [[dok]] of homelessness and communitylessness) and obstruction of solving it are inherently bourgeois-aligned.

<br>

Continental Philosophy^^tm^^ has long had a Nietzschean Crisis (and the analytics an All Too Humean one) that it does not wish to solve because the academy is still fundamentally aligned with capitalism, no matter how much they try to deny it (or even claim it themselves!). They haven't escaped deconstruction of experiencing metaphysics. As such, it lacks the {[[Axioms]]} to construct an answer to postmodern-supercharged capitalism. I've yet to find a neo-metarationalist who comes close either. 3%.

Humans have trouble communicating freely and honestly. They do better when they have fewer misleading assumptions to work with. Unfortunately, many incremental material advantages are created simply through abusing information disadvantages. But, of course, launder evidence until it is admissible in court. Those who do not strive to tell the young what the world really is have committed an immoral crime against their Humanity. By all means, corrupt the youth [[irwartfrr]]. In virtue of their future selves, they have a moral right to know the corruption in our species now. 

<br>

My bet is that internalists conveniently claim that something is only moral or immoral if their own mind conceives it (yet another NIH syndrome) so that they may leverage their curated ignorance of their responsibilities. Neat trick, and a deceptive form of dogmatism. Coherence percentages can be manipulated (though they refuse to speak of these standards, since that's externalist); even if you're allotted 1%, you can spend it on very special lies. I fucking hate that my job as a philosopher is to hunt down the fundamental lies people tell themselves; I find modeling the minds of others exhausting even when they are trying in good [[faith]] as it is. Believing there is a true contradiction turns out to be a pinnacle of reason (as is our partial construction of any representation of the thing-in-itself), but claiming the absolute right to define or justify it is absurd. Say the climb of the external is impossible to complete all you want, it's the price you must pay to escape solipsism with integrity.

Micro-computing and the PC were mishaps of the market, accidentally revealing to the proletariat that The Stack's machinery was never intended to be theirs or to empower their autonomy in the first place. Literately and literally owning a general purpose personal computing infrastructure has never been the goal of elite capitalists who have simply been cultivating legalized virtual rent-seeking via lock-in on a the treadmill of shiny, invasive black boxes eating the world. Repairs, modding, internal critique, and adjusting the box's telos are highly undesirable to those in power (so: go fuck yourself). They aim to root your life inside and out to extract as much capital from you as they can. They'd be happy to see you enslaved as a zombie NPC technofeudal serf for a dollar's worth of abstracted political power. I owe my life many times over to the FLOSSers out there. Thank you.
