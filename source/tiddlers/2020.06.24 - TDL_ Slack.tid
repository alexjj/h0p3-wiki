title: 2020.06.24 - TDL: Slack

* Clean your board off.
** Figure out what to do with it.
** It's simply unacceptable to not have immediate writing/drawing space.
* People need underwear. 
** So do you. Nobody wants to see your balls. I can smell them from here.
* [[Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση]] - don't give up. [[BAGD]]. We can do it.
* They have to plan and make dinner. 
** They have so much to do tomorrow. Where should we assume slack?
** [[j3d1h]] sounded like she wants to do pasta/salad. I'd like to see them trade picks.
* [[Leet]] drafting needs to be amped.
