I did have [[MuWire]] up, but not anymore. IRC2P is probably still too centralized and prone to bots. [[eyedeekay]]'s [[brb|https://eyedeekay.github.io/brb]] or [[MuWire]] (though, I think it's dead) or rolling our own is possible. We're not at voice comms yet, but Mumble with i2pd's UDP tunnels or [[samforwarder|https://github.com/eyedeekay/sam-forwarder]] might be doable (you might not care for fiddling with Mumble's settings to get it working right). I2PChat with SAM or Retroshare over i2p are probably the better p2p-oriented tools that route over i2p, and I can't say I adore them either. Tox over Tor is still my recommendation, and that doesn't require Whonix.

It's fine if you don't have Whonix (I'm assuming that even with virtualbox running on ARM, you're running into problems with multiple virtualization tools - I know I have that problem with virtualbox). I assume you appreciate the mindset of it. You might go the more dangerous route [[by container|https://github.com/bcapptain/dockernymous]]; eventually, I [[hope]] to do this by FirecrackerVM.
