* j3d1h

* k0sh3k
** I've been bleargh all week.
*** Tail-end especially, imho. 
* h0p3
** Gunky, fluid, rapidfire, makeshift. Had serious chill time, lots of sleep in some cases. The week felt like progress, but not a dreaded march. It's been cold AF, and even with my fingerless gloves (haxor), I'm getting chilled to the bone (extremeties as usual). 
* ASK
** I'm pretty good. looking forward to spring. the cold makes everything stop working right. I looked into it and it is okay to cut my blood sugar pills, so I should be able to stop watching it quite so closely.

!! What was interesting to you last week?

*Why is there such a big gap between the elevator doors and the floor?
*Why don't people in CT know how to (not) drive on ice?
* Played a new game
** What game, loser?
* Workin' on pirate shit has been cool.
* Snowpocalypse

!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family (including ourselves)?

* 1uxb0x
** I've been reliably doing my work as of late.
** Thank you for salting the sidewalks when there was freezing rain; and for shoveling the snow and clearing the cars!
** I respect how you don't care about how you look except insofar as you are morally obligated in virtue of how our species operates in practice. 
** Thank you for continuing to try to play games with me. Eventually I will have time management down and it will actually happen. Playing with you is definitely good incentive.
*** NP! I'm quite excited to play!
** Chilling with you and planning a revolution (both fictional and real) was very fun. :)
* j3d1h
** I think I'm getting good at spinning up character concepts from basically nothing.
** Thank you for noticing when my car lights were still on - I did not need to wake up to a dead battery!
** Thank you for working with your body in freezing weather.
** You shimmed the toilet (doesn't rock anymore) and sealed the bathroom; it works and it looks good to boot.
** Thank you for helping me clear off the snow.
** I love hearing about your worlds and characters. The thought you put in to everything is Most excellent. Your attention to detail combined with your creativity makes for some very interesting conversations.
* k0sh3k
** I think I did a great job picking out the kids' birthday presents this year - especially the SCP thing. :)
*** Thank you. You are a gifted gift-giver. I'm jelly of your skill. You've worked magic with few resources too.
** Thank you for being so careful on the roads, being extra-cautious. 
** You are surprisingly skilled at hiding wisemen from us.
** It's outstanding that you freely offer your time to the librarians of the world. Yes, you are officially cool.
** You have been singing and humming a lot more lately. I enjoy hearing it, and I think you've been extra mindful about your mental health with it too.
** You are absurdly patient with your extended family. You are a rolemodel to us all.
** I had fun with hunting the wize men, thank you!
** Thank you for the SCP gift.
** Thank you for including me in the family events. I will cherish the memories for as long as they exist. 
** Thanks for picking up Encanto, it was a nice watch.
* h0p3
** We've lived in the house for a year, and I think our organization and habits have been useful.
** Thank you for watching terrible tv with me, even if it makes you fall asleep.
*** <3. 
** I'm happy that we're at the point where I can have a much more fluid sleep schedule.
** Thank you for letting me sleep with you twice this week. I think I may feel better because you were guarding me from nightmares.
** Thanks for making your room a more comfortable place to watch shows and whatnot.
* ASK
** You're almost shockingly aware of how others are feeling.
** You got that dreaded ball rolling this week. Good job!
** I enjoyed our date eating chinese food. <3. 
*** I also enjoy having an "errand" day with you. I hope we get to do that moar.
** [[MTG]] has been a pleasant distraction and connection point too. You are quite patient with a game that many people would just give up on. 
** Thank you for the turkey dinner - it was delicious!!
*** Indeed! And, thank you for planning meals. 
** I'm happy that you are sleeping better.
** The scarf you made for me is amazing. Thank you. 
** You got on the phone and did what you had to do. Good job. Try to stop using language like "I failed" and start celebrating the effort.
*** <3
