title: 2020.11.29 - Prompted Introspection: Recurring Dreams

!! Do you have any dreams that recur? Why do you think you continue to have that dream?

I have serious doubts about the value of these questions, but that's alright. Dreams take up some significant percentage of my life. I'm not convinced we understand all that much about sleep and dreaming, and I may be wrong (a semblance of dreaming seems valuable even in ML). 

There are certain places in the world I've been that are strong images I've embedded in many memories. They form part of the anchors (and perhaps in a sense a horizon) of my spatial [[phenomenology]]. {[[Vault]]}'s timing is spaced according to spatial anchors for me. I am reminded of Madame [[Sphygmus]]' concept of Placeness here. I am stuck dreaming about versions, amalgamations, and remixes of places I've been before. I do not claim the representations are accurate. I know it is this place or that place when I see it in my dreams though. My dreams don't have anything even close to the resolution and realness feeling of waking life for me though. I'm envious of those who have vivid dreams, and even more envious of those who experience them lucidly. 

I think my species has evolved to dream, and while I see some merit in questioning it as epiphenomenal, I'm increasingly open to the claim that they tend to serve some sort of purpose in preparing our predictive systems. I don't feel so much like myself in a dream, but more like a passively observing enchanter riding behind the eyes of a pet.<<ref "i">>
