```
.hi, this is me, hopesthoughts. I got the name from an old domain I had
that was my blog for a couple years. I accidentally let it expire
unfortunately, yay me!! I had to make a new Reddit account back in 2018,
because I lost access to the email address that I used to verify my old
one with, and somehow I never put that one in my password manager, I was
using LastPass, at the time. When I went to do that, I used the same
name as the domain I had at the time. However, it looks like I made the
HN account first.
     There's a story behind that whole thing, I was using Lavabit, and
my mailbox hit it's quota. If you were on HN at the time, you're
probably familiar with Lavabit. However, I'll put this link here just in
case:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavabit
     I actually read RSS in one of the stranger ways of doing it,
Miniflux doesn't expand RSS feed entries, but when I used to use Google
reader, I use to always use list view as well. Therefore, I end up
opening links in the browser anyway. Miniflux does have an overlay, but
I only use it if there's a broken link, or the feed item is a 404 for
some reason, which is my favorite number lol.
     I'm on Telegram, and I do have Elemt. However the element interface
doesn't work all that well for me. A friend of mine wanted me to use
that, instead of Telegram, so I set it up, but it's been kind of a pain.
Half the time, I don't see the messages. They do have a desktop app, I
should probably get down to installing that, instead of using the web
interface.
