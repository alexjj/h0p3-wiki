"""
[11:19 AM] h0p3: How's it hanging, sir?
[12:34 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Not too bad. Looks like we might get to walk today. :slight_smile: how are you?
[12:34 PM] h0p3: Noice. Hope it goes well.
[12:34 PM] h0p3: I'm doing fine. Monthly Audits and work on the concept of [[Friendship]] today. Gonna be a busy one.
[12:34 PM] h0p3: Saw a fun movie, The Platform, last night.
[12:53 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Nice! Sounds like fun times all around. I’m gonna try to finish these essays today or tomorrow. Plowing through now.
[12:56 PM] h0p3: `/salute` - I wish you coffee and success.

[12:24 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Hope family time goes well today. ^_^
[12:59 PM] h0p3: Gracias! :slight_smile:
[1:00 PM] h0p3: I hope your day goes well too. Any plans for today?
[1:02 PM] Ardent_Assailant: We are going to get ice coffee, taking a walk around the complex, then We’re going to play board games with my brother and his fiancé over discord.
[1:02 PM] h0p3: Fuck yeah.
[1:02 PM] Ardent_Assailant: It’s going to be fun. How about you? Anything new going on today? :eyes:
[1:04 PM] h0p3: I have some new folx talking to me over my wiki. I'm not sure what to make of their responses. Need to think about that. Still have lots of work to do, but nothing too new.
[1:05 PM] Ardent_Assailant: That reminds me. I’m far too late in asking this but how was talking with your Neo Nazi friend? Did you have any interesting conversations?
[1:06 PM] h0p3: https://philosopher.life/#2020.04.19%20-%20Carpe%20Tempus%20Segmentum%3A%20Family
[1:06 PM] h0p3: He's hanging in there.
[1:07 PM] h0p3: It is always an interesting conversation with him. We've known each other for about 15 years. Similar backgrounds. Went to school together.
[1:08 PM] h0p3: I had my first child when I was 19, and he at 21ish. He graduated at the same time [[JRE]] did. He was dead serious in slapping me on the back and saying he was so happy to have a child to cancel mine out.
[1:42 PM] Ardent_Assailant: He seems like an interesting foil to you. Not in a literal sense. The contrast is just interesting.
[1:42 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Glad to hear it was fruitful. :slight_smile:
