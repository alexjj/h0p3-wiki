title: 2022.03.22 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Packed

Woke at 2? Instantly awake. Interesting. [[TTTOTW]]. My sympaticon awoke, feeling depressed. //Skintime// and comfort. 

She's up. Bugged mi amor. Not enough sleep, kinda a carefree attitude about the day. SCOPA is clearly a mill, so she's treatin' it as such. The people around her cannot write, though they can signal well enough (I'm one of your tribe, hire me). Like pulling teeth to get people to write out their processes. Might just be a giant pile of work left for SL (her own damn fault).

//Skintime// with my sympaticon + //Community//. Cheered her up some. We both identify with Abed, clearly. Made breakfast. Tea and bagel. [[D2]], up Durance 2 with Sugar, prepped for when my son plays with us, as we'll skip all of A3 for him.

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

//The Walk// with my sympaticon. She has been collecting shiny rocks for each walk we take, and she's making a collection. It's dope. Also, we found three sections of trees to carry with us back home for the [[garden]]. 

Dialectics with my daughter. Continue to say what must be said. Sucks.

Started up dinner. Had a bit of fudge too. =).

Dadnap. Garbage. [[TTTOTW]]. Son came down to play [[D2]] just as mi amor came home, and she let us play. <3. Some bugs with portals into Durance, but we got there. Izual quest, and quit.

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. Surprisingly, I walked through my day. I'm glad she chilled some. //Inform the Men!// Shower of the gods!

Offspring and I completed dinner. Talked about P2P trust and e-mail with [[ASK]].

[[Family Gathering]] was good. Talked for a while before the show. Pulled pork (kraut on mine) on toast, green beans, salad, water. House gets played on T-day episode. Adults stayed to talk about the fate of the possibly dying (and dangerous) mulberry tree.

[[TTTOTW]].

Put mi amor to bed. [[TTTOTW]]. Salvia for [[ASK]]. Strong effect in her, and requires serious tripsitting. It helped though. //Skintime// with my sympaticon + //Community//. I fell asleep at 11?
