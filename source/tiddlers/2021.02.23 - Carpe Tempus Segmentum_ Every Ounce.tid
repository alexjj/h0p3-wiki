title: 2021.02.23 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Every Ounce

Fireman Time! Vapelyfe. [[TTTOTW]]. 

The Drop. Up very late reading, devouring, weighing, digesting. 75k lines (probably could be munged to 15k (I'm lazy). Heart beats the entire time, some gulping painful moments, seeing myself in many people too, racing through my memories and dot-connecting. It might be my favorite (and, I'm still jelly that I have nothing even close to this level of work [your hard work shows too]).<<ref "o">> I'm not surprised (it matches, even my guesses, fleshes out ghosts), but I am enthralled. I celebrate your honesty, humility, vulnerability, and how far you've come. It does put the world together for me, and I'm still teaming with questions (that I'm sure I'll forget, but it's the sort of thing that must be revisited many times). I know how much this means to you, and you know how much it means to me. You do know my pain too, and I think you always have. This is the gift I needed. Thank you. No matter what. Don't stop, girl. Keep going.

Sleep worked. THC bad for sleep, CBD good, Grogg. 

[[Morning Routine]], Hugging'n'Bugging everyone. My wife's dealing with people who do not take her seriously again. Malicious misogynistic morons. I'm predicting that they will eventually learn though. I can't help but laugh, cuz it's funny. Nothing is endangered, but I want to get a rise out of her too (while agreeing, of course :P). So delicious. 

My brother left me a dope song. No idea how he curates, but it works. He has this wide range, plenty of huge misses, and yet, the number of 7/10's out of him in this sphere is higher than anyone else I can think of. Anyways, turned the volume all the way up, shook my beads and my ass. Killer song, got it out of me (and something else into me). I feel like such a skillless savage when I dance.

[[Fitness Routine]] with everyone but my wife. 4 is a party. My offspring race ahead. Asking them to slow down the strength exercises and do them right. I am a broken record. It's my job in life with humans. "Now, listen hur...etc." They got a walk in.

Bro encountered some sociopaths. Makes me sick. I'm glad it's a ghostable stage (though my brother is polite and constructive in this kind of discourse; he provides a reason before dropping). Trying to make friends is so hard, especially for higher intensity people who are filtered out for requiring more energy investment than most people are looking for in their selfishly skewed transactional approaches to socializing. There's also this huge gap between meeting him in person and over the wire (I mean, it's always a gap, but for some it's lightyears different, as in his case). I think by the end of the year, presumably with Covid's decline, he will be much better positioned. Low pressure requirements are useful as he adapts and integrates (very happy we've done it this way). 

More hugs'n'bugs.<<ref "t">> Daughter apologized to me for failing to do as she said. Oh, your words mean everything to me, acts in themselves. It's okay. We've all been there. I'm 35, and I still don't have my shit together. Keep going. You got it.

[[TTTOTW]] - Unfortunately, I'm not getting much writing done at all. Consuming and pondering. I wonder if that trend will continue as I morph. 

An hour of //Skintime//. Every ounce. Best part of the day. This is a solvable public health crisis, but I'll agree it's not easy to solve. It can't be a market. Of course, I'm [[bias]]ed. I could use 4 waking hours a day of this medicine, fucking commie. Also, the woman continues to anticipate my exact words in this [[‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±]]. Going to need to acronymize "I just wrote that lmao, did you peek?"<<ref "n">>

[[Family Gathering]]. Bro was sleeping, and I didn't want to wake him. I know he's tired, and he needs to rest. I had tuna wraps, cookies, and beer. Lots of chat, and my son and I wrestled on the chessboard. I am reminded of how dumb I am when I'm with him. I only got punched in the liver twice tonight, :P.

Nap, Fireman Time!

<<footnotes "o" "This paragraph completely misses the point, it's too outside. It's not what I worship, but it's still interesting to me. One of my favorite parts of your work is that you cannot significantly separate the art from the artist (and that is rare for me). It's a living example. I think it's a mistake to attempt to appreciate or value one but not the other here. Most pieces can be consumed without accountable interpretation, and yours cannot; you reveal yourself and your interpreter to them. I like that attempting to understand your point of view creates an immediately useful potential interactive bridge to you of some kind. I appreciate that it's difficult to enter your world too.">>

<<footnotes "t" "A decade of having them next to me most of the day, and now, I'm dying for just a few hours. I knew it was going to be hard, but I had no idea how hard it was going to be. I don't think it's going to end. So many parents are glad to be rid of their children (as evidenced by happiness studies), but the hole it leaves in me is impossible to fill. I'm working very hard to be selfish and sane, even though it looks like it should be a simple task. I can hear the assholes saying to me, 'just get over it.' It's not that easy.">>

<<footnotes "n" "Now there's a huge difference. If I live with you, once a week is acceptable, it's a second pass, it's another look at what I already knew 99% of the time, it's accounting and confirmation and retelling, it's a way of seeing what you've filtered and helps me understand what's percolatin. It helps me plan and see a broader narrative too within a structure I can visualize.">>
