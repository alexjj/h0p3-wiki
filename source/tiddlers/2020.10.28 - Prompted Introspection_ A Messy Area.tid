title: 2020.10.28 - Prompted Introspection: A Messy Area

!! Write about a messy area in your home, workplace, or life.

The garage is not great. There's a fluid leak in our ancient SUV, and we use cardboard to soak it up. The extra things we have acquired and my toolboxes line the back wall in a disorganized manner. It's not a particularly full garage, but it's not something I've poured time into making neat and easy to rummage through. I'm hoping that //The Asylum// will be a place where I am convinced it's worth my time. I've basically had a strong feeling we wouldn't be living in this residence more than a year, and I'm just going to pack it up again. I'm excited to have a space where long-term organization will be useful and dependable.
