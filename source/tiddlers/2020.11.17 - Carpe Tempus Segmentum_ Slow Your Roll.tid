title: 2020.11.17 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Slow Your Roll

* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
* Chips + Lemonade + Garbage.TV
* Sleep by 4
* Woke at 1
** Hrm. I didn't actually get up any earlier, and don't feel well-rested. 
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Bank transfer went through. Done.
* Landlord sent us a message. Coincidental timing, sure (and, if not, `/wave`)
** Wife and I requested early termination of lease within the next few weeks. 
*** Sadly, we will not be let off the hook
* Read+Write
** Signaled the address to those who have Signal
* Had offspring join me in search for Washer+Dryer
* Researching options and making calls. 
** Electricity, water, and sewer are set for now. There's enough oil to last until we sort that.
** Annoying folks by putting everything into her name. My social credit score is irrelevant. Hers is the only thing that must be maintained. 
** No automatic deductions up front, sadly. 
* [[JRE]] Called
** Congratulating us. 
** Volunteered to do electrical work. He says my wife will have to do the color differentiation (since the boys are color stupid). 
*** We need to verify that the breaker is not "Federal Pacific" brand.
** He laughed (in an understanding way) that we had planned to have extra time to move but that we would consider amping up anxiety by moving immediately to save money instead.
** Daycare options being explored
* Decided not to split up on shopping. We aren't going to be moving asap.
** Offspring stayed home in that case.
* Vapelyfe
** Fuck it, sounds good to me.
* //The Walk//
** Trying something new out because my wife detests being cold: walking in the sto. 
*** Too many people, too many obstacles, but I can adapt.
*** Not of a fan of being in stores for a bunch of reasons. I need time with her though. 
** Her boots finally broke. Zipper died and the soles cracked all the way through. Got a new pair. 
*** Everyone but my daughter got a pair.
** X-mas shopping for my daughter
*** Was going to get a kitsch-picture that I thought looked really cool, thought she might. Wife didn't think it was a good pick. She's usually right, and might as well listen. She's much, much better at getting gifts.
**** Trying to limit picking out productivity tools while still being useful (which is difficult because I have such a broad definition of productivity here, e.g. even clothing is performative enough in my book that it counts, as my daughter very clearly knows). Shooting for something that is pretty and useful because I still don't trust myself to pick out pretty alone. 
** Lookin' at the folks outside the liquor store, and I'm thinking I'd like that to be the place I hang out when I'm not with the fam or walking. Seems like a spot to talk.
** Shopping @ Aldi
*** We got ginger beer for my wife. All of it. Know they might run out (rarely have it). 
*** Pizza rolls and mints for my son, as he requested/likes.
* Cooked with offspring
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Fishsticks, asparagus, potato soup, water
** [[MTG]], son played Affinity vs MUC +0 (he's new). Kept a sketch 1-lander with spike and 2ccs to sculpt, ripped off the top and he was never in the game. Lots to learn on bluffing, and it's not easy to force through bombs because I'm more than happy to spend my lifetotal as a resource.
*** We talked about how shackles forces overextension and ostone punishes it. It's been a long while since we talked about it. He knew he was dead, but he couldn't explain why. Also, stripped the only artifact land, so it was a complete wipe.
* [[AIR]] Called
** Congratulating us. Must get walkthrough for him.
** Made dinner for a friend.
** Needed to vent about Justin, ex-manager, who sent a message that was gaslighting my brother. I'd be pissed too.
