** Neat idea. I'm still going to hold off. I have more practical matters to attend to at the moment. The risk of this project is simply too high.
* [[2020.07.01 - Prompted Introspection: Tampon In My Butt]]
** This reminds me of the grandparents X-mas scene in //Rick and Morty//, that line about being a collection of real experiences, lol. Lawd, that show.
* [[2020.07.01 - Wiki Review: On Brain]]
** That is not something I normally would argue. I [[hope]] to soften up on their sneaking away to do what they do. It's an important experience and part of growing up. 
* [[2020.07.01 - TDL: Cumbending]]
** I have been surfing, and out-of-order execution too. Still mixed feelings about that. 
*** One thing I do like about it is that I don't feel the same pressure to deliver something (there's something clean about that). There's a leisure to it I appreciate. The extra spacetime distance allows me to dissociate a bit more, though that isn't necessarily a good thing either. I just don't know.
**** Exploring this funny doohickey contraption because I have to prescribe as a teacher, but I'm still such a fucking novice in this space still. 
* [[2020.07.01 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Chaos Dreams]]
** The dates keep getting pushed back on her. I should have predicted that with more confidence. 
* [[2020.06 - Wiki Review]]
** Far from perfect, it's a gift that keeps on giving. It must look insane from the outside for most folks. It's a simple systematic place to unfold ourselves as [[other]], to externalize what was subconscious.
* [[2020.06 - TDL]]
** I have that positive-nihilist's feeling of knowing the absurd amount of context that goes into understanding this hyperobject without feeling awful about the loneliness of it. I hope I can keep that. 
* [[2020.06 - Prompted Introspection]]
** Yeah, I have been adjusting my habits here. I feel like I've had a kind of flexibility or safety about it. Again, I cannot say I'm making the correct move. Let us [[hope]] it is exploration.
* [[2020.06 - Link Log]]
** Also, that distribution looks more normal. It's not front or backloaded. 
* [[2020.06 - Family Log]]
** Okay, June was a good month for your family, dude. Look at it. =). You are lucky.
* [[2020.06 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum]]
** I cannot say it is always pleasant to read my own wiki, but it's a journey unlike any other. I reasonably understand the person(s) who wrote it enough to have it come alive. 
* [[2020.07.01 - h0p3ful Review: Doing Well With What We Have]]
** It's weird to have this part of the interactive process with my offspring that I don't even have with my wife. It's the detailed aspect of it; my wife and I give broad pictures at this point, and that works.
* [[2020.07.01 - h0p3ful Review: Probably probably]]
** I wish I knew how to describe it to myself even. [[h0p3ful Review]] with my daughter is this living [[hyperconversation]]. Our relatively deep understanding of each other makes it easier to have tacit, implicit, shortcutted, and even trusting interpretations. At some point, I don't know if an outsider can follow it; there's too much unspoken context as well as the privately spoken context that never made it in. 
*** Usually, we can pick out the referents to continue the thread where necessary.
*** I like how we pick out the [[salience]] together. It feels like a microcosm of wikis in here. 
** I adore how my daughter will lambast this insane thing I've built and crazily taught her to engage in, this thing she probably won't be able to explain well enough to anyone else (sadly), and yet appreciates it with me.
*** I don't think she treasures it with me in the same way, but that's understandable. 
*** This is actually where I think RPing should go if it were to become more practically useful beyond the hedonic value of a drug and narrative analysis.
