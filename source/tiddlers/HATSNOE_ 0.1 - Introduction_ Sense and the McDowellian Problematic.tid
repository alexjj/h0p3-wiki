title: HATSNOE: 0.1 - Introduction: Sense and the McDowellian Problematic

Solving McDowell's Problematic, between a rock and hard place, by syncretizing Heidegger and Hegel's Aristotelian commitments to bridge the world itself and our ability to represent it in a way we sense we understand.

> the bases for our knowledge of the world are “Given,” that there are deliverances to our senses that are prior to and independent of the interference of any discursive, conceptual, or otherwise acquired capabilities, and which may at the same time play a justificatory role within the ambit of such capabilities.

At least as humans, it seems like our ability to perceive the world must be acquired. I cannot argue that all Dasein must be as such though. There's an [[embodied cognition]] problem here, one that we may be tempted to claim requires bootstrapping, but I think that's more of a material matter of how do complex systems arise in physics than a conceptual reason.

I don't see a problem with claiming a Given plays a justificatory role, even a necessary one for minds like ours. It can be one of the bases. The classical empiricist is making another bare leap altogether, I'm afraid.

> a mistake of a piece with the so-called “naturalistic fallacy” in ethics

Of course, I don't see a way to peel epistemology apart from morality. 

> scientifically-describable 

That weasel word...

> naturalistic, in the sense of definitively characterizing perceptual states in terms of scientifically-describable causal impingements upon our sense-apparatuses, can be translated into an account of how such impacts could have any normative force

Naturalism itself cannot. The game is over if you think it can be reduced to material.

> If we reject the notion that there is a Given

How could you? Even if we were just attending to ideas themselves, there is a Givenness. The question is whether or not that Givenness is attached to anything outside ourselves, the realist's leap of [[faith]]. What does it even mean to perceive without a Given? I'm not calling it sufficient for our epistemology, but I will call it necessary.

> to act as an epistemic authority over our beliefs about it, even if it remains a causal factor in the origin of those beliefs.

I do not see why the Given is an epistemic authority, though it may play a justificatory role. The authority is ultimately external to our minds as well. Perhaps we are wrestling with the isness of oughtness.

> Instead, it begins to look as if the only sorts of things which may play the role necessary for justifying, that can do the work of providing reasons, are not perceptual deliverances but rather prior beliefs.

Ultimately, justification's foundation is external to our own beliefs as well. 

> without a Given, a normative foundation for empirical thought, our beliefs about the world appear to be based only in other beliefs, which in turn are based in other beliefs, and so on—and we quickly realize that there is no place in which the world itself intervenes at all in our ways of thinking about it. 

Why should we think our beliefs are based only in other beliefs here? Could they not arise from other kinds of machinery, even if we can't attend to them? Whether or not we are aware of how the world affects our beliefs doesn't mean the world doesn't. Perhaps it prevents us from knowing whether or not we have justification though.

> The expression “frictionless spinning” is, I take it, meant as an allusion to the first Critique, where Kant famously arraigned Plato and the entire rationalist tradition associated with him

To my eyes, if we were to assign agenthood to [[The Good]], its justification may be frictionless, and its justification is coherentist. We aren't the self-justifying subjects of the world if there were any.

> In other words, it has to do both with whether and how the world normatively constrains empirical belief in virtue of whether and how in the first place it plays a role in determining the cognitive significances that figure in empirical thought.

The coherentist can just live in a solipsistic world, but there is no escaping there being the world. We're just wrong about what it consists in. The normativity itself is external, a feature of the world, and the truth of whether or not we've met the standard is at least partially external to us. There's no escaping the constraint. Again, note how we can be unaware of how it affects our cognition and we can still be contrained by it.

> It is at its core, therefore, a transcendental question, and its concerns are thus “up-stream” from those of epistemology, 

Yeah, it might be at least partially a transcendental question, but why should I think it's upstream of epistemology? Upstream of our belief formation, `nod`, but I think we should look at semantics of the world as possibly being fundamentally epistemic entities.

> two conceptually distinct registers of the Given, the epistemic and the semantic

Why should I think what is semantic is not epistemic? I'll agree there's a difference between human epistemology and valence of meaning external to our minds (former being a roughly a subset of the latter).

> the semantic Given refers to the idea of cognitive significances (i.e. something like Fregean senses) which would hold their content-full (and thus normative) statuses independently of the presence of any other such significances in a cognitive economy

There may be limits to how far this independence goes, especially if we scale a cognitive economy up to [[The Infinite]]. I remain unconvinced that anything is fundamentally independent except perhaps [[The Absolute]] [[Itself]], if that makes any sense (and I don't claim it does).

> In both its epistemic and semantic registers, then, the Given is whatever performs the function of an unmoved mover—either epistemically as self-justifying or not in need of justification

That must surely be poetic metaphor. Over time, we can be indirectly responsible for the epistemic Given we attend to. Insofar as I understand the semantic register, and insfoar as we do not causally influence the world as such, especially insofar as it is The Necessary, I stand in agreement. 

I'm a Foundationalist, into [[infinigress]]. If The Foundation had a perspective, it would probably be a coherentist, into [[infinigress]]. Our justifications trace through to metaphysics itself, beyond empiricism and the Given, and there is no justification without doing so. That's a hard pill to swallow, particular for those seeking certainty.

> It is not just that one must have a whole battery of beliefs for any given epistemic belief to be justified, but that there must be in place a whole battery of content for one to be counted as having any content (fulfilling the functions in thought it must to count as such). 

Well said. I don't know if that's true, but I'm sympathetic.

> what Sachs calls a “demand for transcendental friction” (the “Demand”), which seeks to find assurances that our ways of rendering the world intelligible allow us to be “in cognitive contact with a world we discover and do not create”

The Demand is immoral if it requires certainty. The anxiety surrounding that assurance is a moral problem. It is a leap of [[faith]] here, but some leaps are more justified than others, and those moves too require [[faith]]. That there is any intentionality at all, as a category of reason, is one of our best reasons for believing there is a Telos at all, quite similar to naive realism.

> The Demand is thus closely related to, but more fundamental than, the narrow epistemic question belief’s answerability to the world.

It is only more fundamental as a critical species of that type of epistemic questioning and desiring. The Demand looks like a desire to me. Note that a belief can be answerable to the world even if we aren't aware of it or don't experience the friction that generates the kinds of assurance we would hope (but, it seems as though that's the answerability we're most worried about). 

> the world acts as an authority both epistemic and semantic for how we think about it.

That's the only place authority could arise! I'm less inclined to say the world entirely, but that may also be the case. We aren't talking about a meaningful authority otheriwse. Materialism, of course, fails to model The World, unless we want to talk about how ideas themselves are natural or have substance, but this a non-standard way of speaking about it.

> deny outright a space of reasons that stands apart from and is irreducible to empirical description.

Let us say: any finite empirical description. 

> remove a “mental block,” a particularly influential conception of nature as accurately and exhaustively characterized as the space of causal law.  For if that is how we conceive nature, then it seems hard to avoid the result that the space of nature and the space of reasons are separated by a wide gulf

This is Dialetheia territory. I'm not so sure a wide gulf is too problematic, even if it may be unsatisfying. 

> cultivate a richer understanding of nature, we may come to recognize that the true dichotomy exists between a space of causal law and a space of reasons, and that nature, more adequately conceived, may encompass both.

This is perhaps part of where we have been wrestling for a long time, sir. I don't see why I should accept that the space of reasons isn't causal within itself, nor that it isn't the origin of causality, nor that the space of causal law isn't causally related to it. I'll agree the complete model of nature contains both the material and immaterial though.

> we commit something like a naturalistic fallacy when we speak of sensory episodes as justificatory

I don't buy the naturalistic fallacy as being fallacious, but I'll agree that most all individual things that exist aren't sources of ought or self-justifying. I'll agree that sensory episodes are never in themselves sufficiently justificatory for most beliefs, except the self-evident: that we are sensing. 

> his point is to reject the idea that deliverances of sensibility are exhaustively intelligible in terms of causal description in the first place

I don't see why we should buy it though, but I'm open to claims as odd as: we are perceiving metaphysics to some [[dok]] (which surely sounds like a contradiction).

> perceptual episodes are already, constitutively, in the space of reasons

Our qualia is partaking of the particularistic form computed in the noumena. I'm open to the claim that the space of reasons more generally can be distinct from our minds (ours being a subset). I have no idea what it means to say perceptual episodes aren't part of the space of reasons though; that sounds incoherent.

> We are not animals with rationality merely affixed or fashioned to us, but rather ones whose rational nature completely saturates and reworks our animal nature 

We aren't mere instruments, and we're not talking about mere instrumental reasoning here. Rationality with a capital R.

> using Kantian jargon, there is no genuine distinction between sensibility and the understanding, for our passive senses constitutively draw upon the resources of our active conceptual capacities.

A wee bit like a sapir-whorf hypothesis. We're taking the term "sensibility" here to be something more than what jellyfish can presumably do or experience. I'm fine with it being different from understanding, and perhaps one is a type of the other. Looks like there's nested dialectics of boxes up and down, and I'm not aware enough of them. The relationships between sensation, as objects affect our minds, and sensibilities intertwining the types of effects objects have on our minds with various Bayesian branches of perhaps increasing explicit awareness of (or ability to abstract, even lossily) the logic or conceptual nature of our coming to feel-understand the world seem to blend together at some levels, and we are trying to humbly ask what it means, and acting on it. Well, if the jellyfish do have sensibilities, I think they should be differentiated further, except on the hard problem.

> This saturation and integration is attained as a matter of a Bildung, an induction into a form of life that is profoundly discursive, consisting in a cultivation of rational sensitivities that eventually become habitual and passive

And as preconditions for achieving Daseinic teleological perception at all. And, this is the virtue-theoretic point from how our system 2 influences our system 1 as a feedback loop. 

> If we keep second nature in mind, McDowell says, we can open the door to understanding that the space of reasons is not opposed to nature, but instead that rationality is deeply intertwined—to the point, in fact, of inseparability—with the sorts of capabilities traditionally considered “natural.”

Only on the assumption that Origin of Reason is external to our minds, but that is true. And, I suggest not merely intertwined, but itself the causal foundation of the rest of nature. I prolly bite the bullet yall hate though.

> McDowell does affirm that the world is “made up of the sort of thing one can think”

I'll say that parts of the world are ideas, that it is conceivable that a thinking thing may be thinking them, but I am not certain that anything is thinking of it. It exists as The Foundation. It is another thing to say the world comprised of nothing but ideas, and another to say that all we can do is simply represent the world with ideas (to think about, rather than think).

>  conceive of the world as “all that is the case,” the totality of true thinkables; together these claims allow us to recognize how nature is pervaded by the space of reasons, rather than opposed to it. 

Bingo. 

> The world is already of the right form to exert normative force over belief. 

Preach, yo! That's it. The muhfuckin' Hoth system.

> when we trace justifications back, the last thing we come to is still a thinkable content; not something more ultimate than that, a bare pointing to a bit of the Given

Though, I hasten to add that we've entered a space of infinite computation and [[The Dialetheia]], and as such, it can never be fully Given to creatures like us.

> Discursive articulation involves “putting significances together”—but before this can occur, these significances must be “carve[d] out” (McDowell 2009a, 263-4) of the intuitional content, which intuition itself does not do, instead merely delivering the unarticulated mass of brimming content

Though we could argue for a feedback loop here, right? In time, intuitions can be trained, and what was previously discursively disclosed can unconsciously weigh in with the rest of what is unarticulated, sometimes bubbling up into consciousness.

> the “putting together” of significances in discursive activity does not mean the totality can be decomposed into parts which still hold cognitive significance

Perhaps. For [[The Infinite]] that may not the true, if we are to assume it has cognition at all.

> there is nothing intrinsic about intuitional content as such which precludes it from being unified under a different grammar—that is, expressed differently, in a more articulate form. 

That's an interesting point. It's just a matter of access. Given the hard problem of consciousness, we aren't able to know if our constitutive parts aren't just as articulate (if not possibly more, in some cases). 

> intuitions no less than judgments or other discursive activities constitutively draw on conceptual capacities; intuitional content stems, as he says, from “actualizations” of conceptual capacities, while discursive content comes on the heels of their “exercise.”

I don't see why. This isn't a step we have to take. I still agree that the contents of intuition and discursive capacity are at least theoretically suitable for each other.

> the world remains for McDowell “of the right form,” populated with true thinkables, reasons awaiting reasoners

I'm willing to accept that we literally access metaphysics through representations. I think that is an odd phrasing, as I'd say it is our minds that take on the right form to perceive, represent, and come to better understand reality. Perhaps the disagreement may be over the second nature.

> sensibility, conceptually laden and shaped by Bildung though it is, delivers us patchworks of thinkable contents from which we must wring out significances before we can articulate the true thinkables

Sounds a lot like a neural network to me. It is the search for [[salience]], sir.

> the mode of “delivery” of the world’s conceptual content in perceptual experience is understood—whether as already a structured proposition

Uh, perhaps only insofar as we are attending to our own cognitions, but I'm reluctant to say the world does otherwise. There are some cases that come close, for example writing sentences to each other, but it still passes through the unconscious predictive machinery of neural systems.

> “deleting” the boundary (McDowell 1994, 34) between conceptuality and the world, in seeing the world as in itself conceptual.

This might be present-at-hand mode in some cases, but that doesn't mean the world is in itself conceptual. 

> On [Sellars’] account, there are word-word relations expressible as semantic rules, which belong to the conceptual order, and world-world relations, semantic uniformities, in the real order; but there are no relations of meaning or aboutness between items in the conceptual order and items in the real order. For that, Sellars thinks, would require the Myth of the Given. 

Not a myth, but he's right that we need that bridge to know we know about the world. Doesn't sound like he escapes solipsism.

> something which breaks up not into particulars but into true thinkables. The problem is that it is also perfectly acceptable and intuitive to think of the world as breaking up into particulars. 

I'll agree that not all particulars are thinkables, but I'm not certain of it. Some particulars are thinkables, and some aren't. Full blast idealism isn't necessary.

> we don’t seem to be able to make intelligible at all how a world which breaks up into particulars may exercise normative constraint on our thoughts about it

It won't be fully intelligible to the [[fff]]. It can't. But, I think your move is too strong here, but it may be damning within McDowell's perspective.

> we should understand neither the Tractarian ontology nor a Fregeanism about facts, nor both together, as implying that there really are no particulars, only senses.

Check.

> we should not take the conjunction to be stating the world is made up of the sort of thing that is thought. 

Check.

> The point he makes is that the world is made up of thinkable contents, not contents of occurrent intentional acts or attitudes, for the latter would surely signal something unpalatable. 

Do you mean to say that the world is made of ideas, some of them being thought and some not? It seems to be missing in this paragraph of denying what you call cartoonish idealism. If that is not what you mean, then I don't think this is really idealism. There is a difference between a thing being thinkable as an idea and a thing being something we can think of, about, or represent. The latter seems true of every possible (and I suggest impossible, however absurd it may be to say it) thing. That isn't complete idealism (I wouldn't accuse [[Saint Plato]] of it either).

> thought and reality meet in the realm of sense

Thought is a subset of reality, and there is no thought without sense. How about that? To my eyes, the hard problem of consciousness cannot be resolved with certainty, and that means we're stuck guessing about the barrier or link. I don't think we escape the involvement of metaphysics in the process of intentional perception.

> Thought makes contact with objects, from its location within the conceptual realm, by exploiting relations such as perception, which are conceived as penetrating the outer boundary of the conceptual” (McDowell 1994, 105), thus sliding back into the Given.

If my thought is in the conceptual realm, beyond its own representation, it is only partially there. My body does not exist in the conceptual realm. My thought makes contact with objects through senses (call them at least partially subconscious thoughts if you wish) triangulated (perhaps overlappingly, from an ontological mapping) with the conceptual realm.

I don't see the problem with at least some form of the Given, however bald and bare pointing it may be in some cases. Must be muh retardations.

>  Would this mean that the sentences containing the name ‘Odysseus’ expressed different thoughts? I think not. The thoughts would strictly remain the same; they would only be transposed from the realm of fiction to that of truth. 

I would have agreed with you on this long ago. I think it's reasonable to doubt it though. There might be a few more differences. 

>  So the object designated by a proper name seems to be quite inessential to the thought-content of a sentence which contains it.

That might be true, or at least there are few exceptions (self-referential might): "inessential" being the keyword.

> If all it means is that the thought is about the object, then this does not go far enough to meet the Demand.

`/nod`. Even if it does have some contact (as perhaps even being directed toward counts), it's not enough, or at least not enough cases.

> Given that the existence of an information-link between subject and object is not by itself sufficient for identification, what makes it possible to have, in the standard cases of demonstrative identification, a mode of identification that is free of the conceptual element we have been considering? The answer is that in the standard cases, not only is there an information-link, but also the subject can, upon the basis of that link, locate the object in space

I'm not completely convinced that the information link isn't sufficient in at least some cases. I deny that it can be free of conceptual elements though. Requiring a location in space is probably question begging.

> McDowell asks us to think of conceptuality as signaling nothing other than Fregean Sinne, that “the right gloss on ‘conceptual’ is not ‘predicative’ but ‘belonging to the realm of Fregean sense’”

I'm still left wondering if there isn't something predicative about it.

> perceptual tokens have the logical form of linguistic tokens

It's possible. I'm not certain it's false. I'm also open to a very inclusive notion of languages, things we normally just think of as information theory instead.

> Conceptualism is importantly not equivalent to any claim that all perceptual contents can be analyzed without remainder into conceptual contents; what it does imply is that perceptual contents cannot be analyzed, explained, or accurately attributed without reference to conceptual contents.

It's possible that perceptual contents can be, but I appreciate doubting it. The latter is obviously true, but there is nothing that escapes this reference to conceptual contents, including nothingness.

> the space of reasons is to be understood not simply as the space of reasoning, but as the space of meaning

Woot, woot! Preach, yo!

> Rather, such awareness is constituted by understanding, a familiarity and competence with intelligibility such that one can navigate meaning, which would include but is not limited to acts of reasoning (i.e. inferring).

It gets blurry. I'm open to emotions as being languages of inference. I do not know how explicit it must be. Understanding probably comes in [[dok]].

> it is requisite for experience to be located within or have purchase in logical space.

For an given experience, I'll agree to purchase, though not entirely located. The concept of experience, yes.

> For a Sellarsian, then, not only must one acquire language, but the resultant contents of experience must thereby be continuous with language such that the contents are expressible or communicable within it.

It's unpopular, but I'm open to that claim. Again, with a wildly broad understanding of how much language permeates perhaps everything.

> what McDowell’s picture is missing, I contend, is a decidedly Hegelian corrective: a parallel notion of how entities themselves have a second nature.

What does not have something at least partially functioning as a qualia? The meaning of any object appears to be in virtue of all the rest of them too. 

> what both Hegel and Heidegger take from Aristotle are the resources for explaining that not only are we cultivated and inducted into the space of reasons by our Bildung, but so too are the things that populate the empirical world; discursivity, like our own second nature, is written into entities’ first nature as potentialities-for-being, which in an ontological sense lie inchoate, requiring activation or realization by us.

Why by us? It seems even the possibility of all minds is already enough.

> Nature, then, is not inhabited by the sort of thing that is immediately conceptual, or cognitively significant merely in itself, but by the sort of thing that can be brought to explicit conceptuality by drawing out its capacities to be such. 

Womp, womp. 

> The second nature of entities thereby supplies a way for understanding how thought, although conceived in a Fregean way, as more fine-grained than the world, does not stop anywhere short of it—how, despite the fact that there are no Givens, the world can be conceived of as breaking up into, and normatively bearing upon empirical thought by means of, particulars.

I will agree that ideas are more fine-grained than the rest of the world. I still don't see why there are no Givens. Unlike McDowell, I'm okay with the rampant Platonism that one should see from Kantian insight, but I don't think thought must be detached from nature.

As a Platonist, I see the second natures of objects as already being fleshed out in the explosion of metaphysics, regardless of whether or not humans cognize about the objects around them. I'll agree there is an activation in our possible world, but not one somehow independent of the Platonic realm at all (rather in virtue of it).
