Yes I was too so sorry for my delay! I hope you all have an amazing weekend ðŸ™‚

Naw, no worries!
Jun 5 10:52pm
You guys have any plans for your weekend?
Jun 5 10:52pm

Not much still taking precaution since we are the number one state in Covid cases spiking since reopening. My mom is going to come stay with us so we are clean and making space for her. And I am going to sit down and start planning this move a little more. We get the new place July 10th. So. Yea just doing stuff around the house! You?

Cool that your mom is coming to stay with you. I hope that goes smoothly.
Jun 6 1:49pm
You're right, you have a lot to do around the house.

We haven't really been heading out much ourselves.
Jun 6 1:50pm
Yea itâ€™s just not worth it to me to be out and about unless we have to. Sorry for my response time we are fixing the bathroom cause they wonâ€™t do anything but emergency maintenance
Jun 6 4:10pm
Ugh. That sucks.
Jun 6 4:44pm
What's up with the bathroom?
Jun 6 4:45pm
Ceiling water stains and mold
