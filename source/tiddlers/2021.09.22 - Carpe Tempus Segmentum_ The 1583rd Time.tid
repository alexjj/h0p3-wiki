title: 2021.09.22 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: The 1583rd Time

[[TTTOTW]]. Sleep by 1. Woke at 5:30? Not quite enough, but it'll do (I'm alert, in a good mood). ~~It's interesting how 5 hours has become "enough" in more cases lately. I assume this means my days are becoming more predictable, as though there is less I must digest and recover from. 5 hours is not enough though. I'm probably kidding myself. So then, presumably, a sleepcrash will come soon enough. Maybe I'll get back to sleeping in longer chunks again (I know [[MWF]] can't, and perhaps that will be the way of it for me as well).~~

[[TTTOTW]]. [[ASK]]ing. Reassurance. They come correct, more than they have to.<<ref "w">> It will be my honor to provide the proofs. Still thinking about a couple drawings. My writing becomes even more schizowordsaladical with them (an effortless interpreter too<<ref "i">>). I like that I can let it go (even half the time). That is a rare treat.

She's up. My two-steps at-a-time bounding to reach her (probably not good for my knees or the stairs). She turns her bone conductors off when she hears her retard puppy, applies her warpaint and does her lashes with that torture device (getting in my face with it too, since I can feel it [I literally have to shut my eyes or put my hand up so I can't see<<ref "a">>]). My morning is incomplete without at least one "I hate you." XOXOs. I've declined her promise, and instead I've asked her to bump it down to a "if I can" (because I'm not convinced she'll have anything left). The multi-houndstooth B/W pattern on her skirt is perfect to my eyes (I don't know the name of the silhouette, maybe mermaid), a silver pin-striped white button-down, glossy black high-top stripper combat boots with steel chains (it's mothuhfuckin' fall...Boot season begins in earnest), and a red kerchief fashioned into a semi-androgynous tie (matches her red cat-eye glasses, though she fusses with her masks to find one that won't clash) flesh her out. She is The Librarian, people. She's cute when she asks me if I think she looks good ("Yeah, I need to fuck you, right now, please"), and then rolls her eyes, "I don't even know why I bother asking you because you always say, 'yes'" for the 1583rd time (this is my current estimate). I don't offer one of my usual lines of reasoning (which is: "that is not that case, as sometimes I don't say, 'yes', and you know that") and just squeeze her flesh for as long as she lets me. She's flustered because she can't find her stuff, knows she's forgetting something; this is her, inescapably. I taste one of her new vitamin gummies, lemon titties. Her lunch is sad (though tasty); I snack that many calories. A has been dividing C's duties, but handing none to her, making a show of it. She says she feels appreciated enough (she was discussing with her boss how she felt like an exception to the Y-Entity's recent realpolitik research internal memo on this sexist problem). I think this woman is never fair enough to herself and obviously cannot see straight;<<ref "b">> grow up in slavery, and you won't even be able to see other [[dok]] of exploitation even count as such. Optimism. You keep it. My job is to know them for what they are. She's giddy as she leaves, she knows she has some wiggle room in the mornings (and she confirmed she knows she //must// take off a half-hour earlier sometime this week, as a moral matter), and she has class (she's accepted the "B" argument).<<ref "n">> That woman lives for the classroom. Lights up. Like a bad TA, I need to cum in her.

Reminders for the offspring. [[TTTOTW]] + Sourdough w/CC + Tea + Footbath + attempts at LoLVod (prefer music for writing though). Still thinking about exikyut. At the end of the day, I gotta let them make the moves. Reaction (sometimes pre-emptive) is my job. I am a control mage (lock/nec, blue-whitefire and fluorescent green-highlighted shadow) in budget rogue stunlock form (maybe a dash of SK), and I must stay in my lane and perfect my opens and rotations down the decision trees. Sleep by noon?

Woke at 4? Guess I was wrong about my sleep schedule. Fireman Time!

A flash.

//The Walk// with my offspring went well today. My son did his work, and my daughter didn't. Alrighty, I've said what I need to for now. Vapelyfe. My son walked us through permaculture ethics and scaling. This led to a conversation about distinctions between morality and ethics, and I  gave them the skinny crash-course of Professional Ethics.course (though we've technically thought about all the points before, it doesn't hurt to reiterate over the concept). 

She came down. She's toast. Nothing left. Can't even study Greek. //Raw Skintime// (disgusted with the wetspots... :P), but we had a blanket ready for her. Watched most of the last standard challenge episode of //Project Runway//. Pure vegg and squeeze.

[[Family Gathering]] was pleasant. We finished off the judging on //Project Runway//'s avante garde episode. Nina only leverages the history of fashion and allusions to plagiarism when she has no actual argument to make; it's underhanded ad hominem. Go you, Sergio. I hope you take it down now (and your tailoring is impeccable, even if you are a terrible person). Brats, kraut, zucchini medallions, fizzy water, and apple pie. Fuck yeah. We watched the Dominatrix episode of //House// + //Skintime//. 

A flash.

Checked on her (surprised she's still up). She can't even remember her day. I jogged what I could for her. Put her to bed.

[[TTTOTW]]. [[5c0ut]] came down to chill with me. I think the couch is perfect. He's enjoying the new folks he's working with. They have a similar sense of [[humor]] to our family's. The walk up that hill is has been treacherous for him, and he had two people stop by to see if he was alright (one about his backpack). Bit of [[ASK]]ing too (a whirlwind for them); they are still safe.
