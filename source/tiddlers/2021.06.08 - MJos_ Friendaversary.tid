Haven't the time to respond your previous long lovely link in our letter chain. But I come (͠≖ ͜ʖ͠≖) bearing gifts.
<<<

Well, I haven't figured out how to respond, so don't worry. I'm the one lagging here. Feel free to respond to a [[/b/]]ed post, as you wish. The more I think about it, the more I'm convinced there are far more worthy drongos to pick out (anyone can hear my voice, but there are some that, for one reason or another, aren't easily heard).<<ref "t">>

<<<
First gift is already uppy-duppy livey-wivey. A parody of Canterbury Tales preludes. https://www.maxwelljoslyn.com/poems/gamers-prelude Not happy with the last two lines – the "asset pipeline" joke doesn't quite land, and the final line hews too close to someone else's parody of the same material – but they can't all be winners. Sometimes they're just chicken dinners.
<<<

Yes, sir. I use [[Update Scanner|https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/update-scanner/]] to follow you;<<ref "c">> you are 1 of 6 drongos that can generate notifications on my desktop from their websites.<<ref "g">> Aside, I've thought about trying to join a session of le homebrew club many times; I end up deleting my message instead of posting it though. Meh. But, I like thinking about it.  

Again, I'm apologize that I cannot interpret poetry well enough. Srs. It's bad. Real bad. Full blown actual retarded. It's Greek to me. But, I'm honored that you allow me to try. 

Your poetry sends me off on ADHD spirals and searching for definitions, e.g. my initial schizoleap on that word parfit is [[this human|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derek_Parfit]]. I'm also looking for [[penis]] jokes the entire time (it's extremely important to me). Don't worry, you aren't the only person disappointed in my deficiency here. 

<<<
Ryan liked it, though :) Speaking of which, have you played Ryan Quest?
<<<

I've not. Please forgive me. I have wandered there more than once (nodding my head in agreement with Ryan on some things too), but I won't be playing. It's a matter of discipline (which I hold onto for dear life). I'm doing my best to avoid playing [[games]] (even the cute ones), except with my offspring in meatspace (as they need a break from my usual insanity, and I can teach a great deal from [[MTG]]). I will have my son (and my daughter) look at it (they both read what you write to me too, my drongo), as he's been into designing MUD-likes since he first started Python (and I'm trying to get him into more gamemaking tools [in virtue of Sir [[DeathOfRobinhood]], who is like a second father to my son sometimes {lawd knows i need halp}], since he's enjoyed doing that with just plain paper, regular playing cards, and simple objects for so long). 

<<<
Second gift will go up on the website hopefully tomorrow. Watch that *space*. Suffice to say it's pretty dang dank, and a pleasurable prank.
<<<

Looking forward to it. And, thank you for the heads up. If you ever have the chance, I recommend trying out [[Δ⁸|Product Review: Δ⁸]].

<<<
Bad news today. Surgeon says my case of carpal tunnel is too mild to risk operating. I officially have to solve this without a lifeline. I've been mentally prepping all spring for June and July to be "get surgery and recover" months. Not any more.
<<<

=/. Can you, like, make it worse without causing pain? XD. Ugh. Part of me is kinda happy that it hasn't grown to be worth the risk, but I totally get it. 

What more have you discovered this spring about living with your condition? 

<<<
I'll make it through, though. Nothing to lose, everything to gain, school on the line, and friends/family to aid me - including my parents, who will house and feed me for a while longer, and Angelo-sensei, who has been shredding the Pythonic gnar, and Carla-san, who's been helping me muddle through a website facelift.
<<<

It's a blessing to have parents like that. 

I've been thinking about Angelo's words, bumping into a few other people, thinking about it with them. I hope he doesn't mind that I've not immediately responded (and, I'm not sure what I want to say...I take forever sometimes). I met him once at a thing. Smart as a whip.

What do you think the odds are of attending school at this point?

<<<
Just noticed that we had our 1st friendaversary as of June 6th - the date I sent my first email to you, prompted by your FTO page.

<3
<<<

Well, how about that? There aren't many people that I get to have a friendaversary with. `/hug`. 

<<<
ugh one more mail

"Haven't the time to respond" in my prev email should be "haven't *had* the time." I.e., haven't gotten to it. Not, "oh la dee da I just don't have the tiiiiime hahaha." I reread it and it looked like I was being an assholio. Not the intention. sry.
<<<

Lmao. I knew what you meant. I appreciate you thinking about my paranoid tendencies though. Imho, you could be cutting if you wanted to, but you're not the sort.<<ref "i">> Pure drongo, sir.
