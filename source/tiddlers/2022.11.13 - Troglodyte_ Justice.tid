I read over that summary of John Rawls' work, and I'm... really not impressed.

If I had to sum up what I read, I claims that the man basically posits that society goes through phases where more things are seen as acceptable, only for this scope to narrow before a new diversity of ideas to emerge. Maybe that's true, but I find the focus on that to be a bit worrying.

When you take this position along with Rawls' notion that laws' and governments' legitimacy are the result of "fair and decent citizens" agreeing that these things are such, it strikes me as less like an observation and more like something of a crypto-Legalist strategy for helping the state assume more power, should it have a more Liberal background. What I mean is, it seems like what Rawls is suggesting that governments had ought to narrow the range of acceptable thought, and only allow for dissent to diversify after being down to a "decent" standard.

Now, the issue is that it's pretty damned easy for an institution with tons of influence (or backing from the influential) to change what is perceived as "fair" or "decent," especially in the modern world with so much milleu-control from online media. Indeed, we are seeing that right now: the typical terms of service on major websites tend to use excuses like "obscenity" and "hate-speech" selectively; allowing for open bigotry and hatred against some, but not others; not those "bad people" excluded from "polite" society.

Maybe these are just flaws in either this one's philosophy or this summary, but if you start from the point of "we need to justify social order," then the notion of achieving "order" becomes sacred and everything else is in danger of being swept away in its favor; even creating disorder can be justified as to bottleneck acceptable thought into a more "orderly" state of society. Like I said: current events.

It's worth trying to [[Straussian]]ly read and re-interpret Saint Rawls (who failed to reason wisely about his own theory in practice) and the related literature. [[Justice]] is quite difficult to define.

I mean, there's a faction of government-backed thinkers here in the 'States who have this concept of "equity," which basically means judging people on the actions of both their ancestors and corporate group (in the sense of: race, gender, ethnicity, etc.) as to lessen or make worse the sentences of offenders. This is what the slight majority of the people in charge here in Burgerland tend to think "justice" is, and it's kind of scary.

It makes me wonder if Rawls was in any way connected to Critical Legal Studies, maybe misrepresented by them, because that's the root of this prejudicial "justice" kind of thing.

For example: there was one black guy who killed about forty and injured eighty more by mowing them down in an SUV, stating explicitly beforehand that he was targeting the victims based on their race. Because of "equity" he's getting a reduced sentence and isn't being charged with a hate-crime.

On the other hand, because "equity" states that white people have "privilege," basically half of all crimes committed by white people against someone of another "race" are counted as hate-crimes, regardless if such prejudice was involved.

And as far as I'm concerned, the root-cause of this is just the general racism of the ruling-class, and a weird self-hating one half the time. As far as I'm concerned, white people are equal to black people and vice-versa; there shouldn't be special treatment on account of "race."

And really, if you ask people what they think is "justice," you'll either get level-headed people who think you have to fairly account for both parties involved without prejudice beforehand, or positively vicious types who want to just take revenge on the nearest proxy for whatever crime. Since the notion of fairness is mutating into "equity," you can see how this problem is getting worse.

Perhaps you're eisegetically injecting the message you want to [[wrestle]] into a strawman puppet. That was not my suggestion, although I think it may be useful to consider the nature of such strawmen.

It turns out that Rawls, in practice, was a reactionary who pursued either the status quo or worse for poor people. He lacked much of the wisdom picked out by CLS.

You have attempted to pick out what [[justice]] is not. Positive accounts are difficult. That is where you may find Rawls valuable.
