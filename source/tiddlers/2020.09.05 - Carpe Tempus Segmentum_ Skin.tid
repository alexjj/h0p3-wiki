title: 2020.09.05 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Skin

* Woke at 2:30
** That's exactly what I needed. 
* Inform the Men!
* Meditation
* Shower of the gods!
* Read
* Cleaning
* Both face down, she laid on top of me like a weighted blanket. 
** I think it's
* Read+Write
* Also, that fucking Xorg problem may be an Nvidia driver issue. Considering rolling back.
** Still feeling the stutterstep and heat.
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Pizza! 
** [[Debatable]], full round-robin
*** Conversation bleeds, highly interrupted. Spend so much time trying to isolate definitions, peeling apart conventions, and going after the spirit of the question. 
**** I am annoying in fleshing it out. Surprise!
**** I think it would be unintuitive, confusing, and exceptionally draining to a rando. 
* Clean
* Interrupted, so didn't get to [[???]]
* Talked with [[JRE]] as he was on his way to pick up Mexican food
** State-sponsored prostitution
** Feels like a teenager again with his habits
** [[T-Money]]
** Imagine myself physicall with him while speaking
** Velcro masks and mask ideas
** Destructive feelings, he's not feeling normal.
** Self-destruction, dark-triadicism, living with intensity, positive/negative disintegration, [[Self-Dialectic]]s
** -=[ Rabbitholed ]=-
** Libertarian intuitions, thinking with Rebecca about the claim that we are owned by others in some crucial cases
** [[The Good]], hypothetical imperatives, contingency
** The necessity of deconstruction in metamodernism. [[Deconstruction Obligates Reconstruction]].
** Interesting rabbithole as I had to kept the markers to back us up. THC may be fucking with his working memory.
** Had to go eat.
* Vapelyfe
* Dialectures
** -=[ Rabbitholed ]=-
** The extreme requirements of speaking with me at full schizoblast.
** Self-construction
** Validations of qualia-centric grogginese and bridge languages, the problematics of respecting each other's claims
** I was given a second timer =)
* The Nightdatewalk
** She was exhausted but was down for a walk!
** Fuck if I remember everything we talked about. 
** My feet are blistering up more.
** I stepped on a slug...ugh. `/shiver`.<<ref "n">>
* Read+Write
* AFireman Time!
** Shattering. It's weird to decide to stop the orgasm. It lasts too long. I must be stupid.
** I've have many times half-joked that I would kill myself if I lost my penis. I've decided I don't care nearly as much as I used to about it. It's convenient and faster, but it's secondary solo.
** This is what should be taught in sex-ed. Talk about homework! World would be a wildly different world if we did. The amount of utility it would add directly (let alone the social implications) would be gargantuan. 
* Meditation
* Clean
* Read+Write+LoL
* Sleep by 5

<<footnotes "n" "Not to be outdone by her laughter: I recalled how I would be grossed out by a bunch Star Trekky slugs engineered to vibrate, sliming across my penis, and then cleaning up the cum to level up. I need to grow slugs. Hijacking my disgust is valuable.">>
