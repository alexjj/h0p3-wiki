Hello, mr Hope! We chatted a long time ago in "deep quest chat", i have some philosophical questions and id appreciate if you have a time and will helping me

Tullia d'Aragona, [19.10.20 11:13]
Sorry for disturbing you:)

h0p3, [19.10.20 11:13]
Hello =)

h0p3, [19.10.20 11:13]
You aren't disturbing me. Glad to speak.

h0p3, [19.10.20 11:13]
I hope to be of use.

Tullia d'Aragona, [19.10.20 11:14]
Well, my main question is about ethics. How small subcultures manage the differences between ethics inside them and outside?

Tullia d'Aragona, [19.10.20 11:15]
"In my subculture doing thing X is ethically right, but in common culture its kinda... meeh, wrong"

Tullia d'Aragona, [19.10.20 11:16]
Hope you understand the question:)

h0p3, [19.10.20 11:19]
There is a lot packed in that question. I don't think I'll have a satisfactory answer for you, but I do have more questions to clarify why there's a lot packed into that question. Do you think subcultures have agency? What do we mean by "manage" here, and are we speaking about a description of how they always do, how they tend to, or a prescription of how they ought?

Tullia d'Aragona, [19.10.20 11:20]
And the second one is more subjective. Do you know some mythological scenarios with infinite search of something? Like Ahasverus story of God cursing him to look for his place till the second coming. I think it is really common pattern, but i cant find any words to be more specific on it

h0p3, [19.10.20 11:21]
I'm not convinced there is an emergent corporate/collective moral agent. I see those groups as being reducible to their individuals when it comes to responsibility (though I will openly agree that there are emergent features, additional complexity, and vagueness that makes it difficult to think about the problem).

Tullia d'Aragona, [19.10.20 11:22]
[In reply to h0p3]
Well, id appreciate if youll provide me with literature:) subculture doesnt have agency, but some people thinks about "whats right", on a level of individual, so the community is somehow starts to forming its own ethics

Tullia d'Aragona, [19.10.20 11:22]
Is this an area of research? Some works or books may be? On how ethics formed

Tullia d'Aragona, [19.10.20 11:23]
Like hacking community, for example. They are crossing the lines with their ethical norms, but they do have ethical norms

Tullia d'Aragona, [19.10.20 11:25]
So how they are actually forming and is there a way to form them?

Tullia d'Aragona, [19.10.20 11:25]
Or it is just "im have more authority than you so we are doing what i tell you"

h0p3, [19.10.20 11:26]
I don't know exactly where to point you here. I think Walzer's //Spheres of Justice// is a reasonable starting place.

Tullia d'Aragona, [19.10.20 11:27]
Oh, ill look for that, thank you

Tullia d'Aragona, [19.10.20 11:27]
Really appreciate your time, my eng is terrible

Tullia d'Aragona, [19.10.20 11:28]
[In reply to Tullia d'Aragona]
And what about that question? If i may

Tullia d'Aragona, [19.10.20 11:31]
[In reply to Tullia d'Aragona]
I want to show that scenario of a human looking for something that he cant even properly describe is quite basic and it is repeating since the dinosaurs, but i cant properly describe it to find something in google

h0p3, [19.10.20 11:31]
Sidgwick and Parfit are also worth your time. I will continue to argue a distinction between description and prescription here. I do not think The Moral Law is merely constructed either (in case we will speak again on the matter). While I am interested in the moral psychology and material development of human beliefs and desires, they are still only instruments.

Tullia d'Aragona, [19.10.20 11:35]
[In reply to h0p3]
Oh, ok, so it is uncontrollable process still, understandable

h0p3, [19.10.20 11:35]
I do not see why it is uncontrollable.

h0p3, [19.10.20 11:37]
As to how ethics are formed (if we are to distinguish that from morality), human behavioral psychology is perhaps what you are after. I would look into an interdisciplinary biologist's perspective. Sapolsky does fine work, though it is not moral philosophy (and it does not answer the question).

h0p3, [19.10.20 11:39]
Part of the issue that you will face is defining what consists in a subculture or a culture too. How small can that set be? I probably sound like a skeptic here. To my eyes, each person may be their own culture (and perhaps even various stages or selections of time slices from a person's life counts as cultures too).

h0p3, [19.10.20 11:40]
If you are asking about the source of our freedom, I cannot give an answer that is satisfactory. I can point you to experts, but I also know they don't have answers here either.

h0p3, [19.10.20 11:41]
That word "authority" is a multi-faceted one. There are different kinds of authority just as there are different kinds of freedom. You may find that to be a crucial aspect of teasing apart this issue.

h0p3, [19.10.20 11:44]
I do not have anywhere satisfactory to point you regarding the metaphor of The Wandering Jew beyond The Dialetheia.

h0p3, [19.10.20 11:45]
What finite modeler can model the infinite? It is a Sisyphean task.

h0p3, [19.10.20 11:47]
I would not be surprised to find that many sufficiently advanced cultures have described the limitations of our ability to describe.

Tullia d'Aragona, [19.10.20 11:48]
You helped me a lot! Thank you once more and thanks for the literature references

h0p3, [19.10.20 11:49]
`/salute`. Anytime. I'm glad to be of service.
