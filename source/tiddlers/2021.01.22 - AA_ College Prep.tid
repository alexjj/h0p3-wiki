Hey there ‚Äîhow are you?
Jan 22 9:19pm
Hey!
Jan 22 9:58pm
Curled up. Thinking. Like a good hiki. =)
Jan 22 9:59pm
How about you?
Jan 22 9:59pm
Good good ‚Äîglad its Friday üòä
Jan 22 9:59pm
Hows the unpacking?
Jan 22 9:59pm
I like my kitchen and bathroom. [[k0sh3k]]'s room is feeling 90% there. Offspring's are still in the work. I have a mattress on my floor, but [[monster-16]]'s battlestation is fully operational. The house functions, but we have a ways to go. I still need to insulate and fix up the attic, etc.
Jan 22 10:01pm
[[AG]] and [[UJ]] are playing with the 3d printer we got ‚Äîthey wanna make dnd characters
Jan 22 10:02pm
Unpacking and gettin' the house has slowed down. The immediate needs are met.
Jan 22 10:02pm
Hell yeah
Jan 22 10:02pm
That is awesome.
Jan 22 10:02pm
üòä
Jan 22 10:02pm
Sounds like a lot of work ‚Äîbut houses are that way
Jan 22 10:02pm
I hear [[5c0ut]] is headed your way?
Jan 22 10:02pm
Yes, indeed. Getting his room set too.
Jan 22 10:03pm
Awesome
Jan 22 10:03pm
Change of scene and loved one,,,,s is always helpful
Jan 22 10:03pm
I told him I would send him some $ ‚Äîis there anything else you think would be helpful?
Jan 22 10:04pm
Not that I can think of, atm.
Jan 22 10:05pm
He should be square, I think.
Jan 22 10:05pm
Excited. =)
Jan 22 10:05pm
Ok well let me know if you hear of anything
Jan 22 10:06pm
I bet he is too ‚ù§Ô∏è
Jan 22 10:06pm
I hope 2021 will be a wildly better year for him. I know it feels like he's failed, but he hasn't. Circumstances just sucked; nothing he could do. Glad there's some light.
Jan 22 10:07pm
Yes we all work together to pull each other away from the pit
Jan 22 10:08pm
`/hug`
Jan 22 10:08pm
Hugs!!
Jan 22 10:08pm
Many years I have felt that way ‚Äîunfortunately life be like that
Jan 22 10:09pm
yeah, it do be like that sometimes
Jan 22 10:09pm
However! [[UJ]] is good about understanding and talking with you helps a bunch
Jan 22 10:09pm
We're gonna make it. =)
Jan 22 10:10pm
Yep yep we are!
Jan 22 10:10pm
I know it's long down the road, but I'm hoping we can do the cabin again when things settle some (Christmas to New Years is an excellent time for us - [[k0sh3k]] gets off work too). I know you haven't been able to travel, but I hope you all will be staying with us when you come up to complete Mary's work (might be too far of a drive, I realize).
Jan 22 10:13pm
[[AG]] is struggling with her ACT ‚Äînervousness and dyslexia and general test anxiety makes it not the best measure for her
Jan 22 10:13pm
Yes.
Jan 22 10:14pm
Ugh.
Jan 22 10:14pm
I would love to do the cabin thing again!
Jan 22 10:14pm
But I will stop on the way to Vermont definately
Jan 22 10:14pm
With [[AG]], she is so mad and frustrated with it that she fights letting us help her figure out how to do better ...ugh
Jan 22 10:15pm
I know that feeling. I am right there just trying to get help [[j3d1h]] get her room set up (let alone something as huge as the ACT). I can imagine it is stressful for everyone. It sucks how much rides on just a few hours of performance.
Jan 22 10:17pm
Any advice? How does one deal with teenage butthead?
Jan 22 10:17pm
Yeah there has to be another way
Jan 22 10:18pm
I am failing, so, I have no idea. Lol. Right now, I just work to make sure that we enjoy dinner. I ask her if she's proud of her work for the day, and if she wants to talk about it with me, we do.
Jan 22 10:19pm
Very understanding‚ÄîI end up nagging and that so doesn‚Äôt work
Jan 22 10:20pm
I still tell her what I think, but I offer a timer to her. 5 minutes until I shut up, hehe.
Jan 22 10:20pm
I nag a bunch still. There's too many things to learn all at once. It's absurd.
Jan 22 10:20pm
I signed her up for an ACT prep class because she generally does better with others...not sure how that will work
Jan 22 10:21pm
That sounds excellent. Even if it just helps with anxiety, that'd be great. I bet it will be far more useful than that though.
Jan 22 10:21pm
I hope so ‚Äîthey need to have a more diversified way of testing
Jan 22 10:22pm
Not sure what that would be but it currently is biased toward those who test well which does not mean they are more capable
Jan 22 10:26pm
Part of the problem is that there's a huge difference between those who have the money, time, and energy to pour 250+ hours into preparation and those who don't. It's hard to level the playing field. Any signaling system is going to be gamed, and that makes it difficult to make effective tests for everyone.
Jan 22 10:26pm
Yeah that‚Äôs true ‚Äîwill let you know if anything works...
Jan 22 10:28pm
gracias
Jan 22 10:28pm
Kinda sucks in some ways that life decisions are made before our brains are done baking...
Jan 22 10:29pm
Yeah. That cannot be informed consent, or, at least not for something as life-defining as this.
Jan 22 10:29pm
We're going to ask [[j3d1h]] to take a gap year or two, probably.
Jan 22 10:30pm
In part, we'll be in a better position to help pay, but it may be useful to her in a lot of ways.
Jan 22 10:30pm
Good idea
Jan 22 10:30pm
Maybe a few credits at a community college ‚Äîjust to keep her brain in shape
Jan 22 10:31pm
(If [[AIR]] needs anything while there...let me know and I will help if I can)
Jan 22 10:31pm
How's school going for you, btw?
Jan 22 10:33pm
Got two last classes ‚Äîjust started Tuesday
Jan 22 10:33pm
Got assignments due on Sunday but one is a tech class. Hoping it will be fun and informative
Jan 22 10:34pm
Gettin' close to the finish line too.
Jan 22 10:35pm
Yep hopefully done in May woot woot
Jan 22 10:35pm
Maybe can start at ECTC in the summer?
Jan 22 10:35pm
\( Ôæü„ÉÆÔæü)/
Jan 22 10:36pm
That would be awesome.
Jan 22 10:36pm
If not, hopefully in the Fall
Jan 22 10:36pm
Excited!!
Jan 22 10:36pm
What do you hope to teach?
Jan 22 10:36pm
They might let you choose what you want to offer, I don't know.
Jan 22 10:37pm
I think I would like to teach remedial math...sounds like that is needed
Jan 22 10:37pm
You will be bridge.
Jan 22 10:37pm
They'll be lucky to have you. I think a lot of students have so many negative feelings about it; they just need to right teacher. [[5c0ut]] was that way too. Found just the right teacher, and it started to click.
Jan 22 10:38pm
Was told that there are a good amount of students that have to repeat these classes 3 and 4 times which sounds awful
Jan 22 10:38pm
oy, demoralizing
Jan 22 10:38pm
I would like to be able to help with that
Jan 22 10:39pm
