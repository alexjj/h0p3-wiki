title: 2021.09.07 - Prompted Introspection: Asking The Universe

!! If you could ask the universe a question and get the truth, what would you want to know?

In whatever fitting order of symbols, what ought I do with the remainder of my life? With whatever is crucial for me to know, flesh out the contents of The Moral Law particularized to my context and the optimal probabilistic sequence(s) for me to pursue. I want to live wisely. [[Help]] me do that, please. I consider it the primary reason to seek knowledge. I'd probably laugh if I was told I'm supposed to be lost sometimes. Okay. It's true. When I'm at my wits end (actually uncommon, to my eyes), I'm not screaming into the void, but I am wrestling and irrationally praying  with the universe.
