You feeling the jump to the 8 core?
Mar 4 2:14pm
Oh yeah. I was getting significantly more frames before my PSU went bad. ðŸ¥º
Mar 4 2:18pm
Looking forward to juicing it even better once we get that part replaced. :)
Mar 4 2:18pm
How are you todayâ€™s
Mar 4 2:18pm
Today?*** typing is hard.
Mar 4 2:18pm
Oh, I didn't realize the PSU was totally ded. ugh.
Mar 4 2:18pm
Well, few more days.
Mar 4 2:18pm
Well itâ€™s not TOTALLY dead, but I canâ€™t exactly work around random shut offs
Mar 4 2:19pm
Iâ€™d rather just wait and troubleshoot.
Mar 4 2:19pm
Yeah, that makes sense.
Mar 4 2:19pm
This week I have a funky set up. Second screen is plugged into my laptop so I can still use my desk haha
Mar 4 2:20pm
Every USB port is in use!
Mar 4 2:20pm
The USB gangbang.
Mar 4 2:20pm
My poor laptop wasnâ€™t ready for this much plugging. ðŸ’¦
Mar 4 2:20pm
lol
Mar 4 2:20pm
My day is fine. Up very late reading and writing (surprise! :P). Gonna give my hugs'n'bugs, and figure out what else I need to get done. Hope to make a CBD tincture for [[k0sh3k]] here.
Mar 4 2:21pm
How about yours?
Mar 4 2:23pm
How's [[L]] doing?
Mar 4 2:23pm
Whatâ€™s a CBD tincture? ðŸ‘€
Mar 4 2:38pm
Work is surprisingly physical today which is nice. [[L]] is annoyed with work but thatâ€™s nothing new haha
Mar 4 2:38pm
It's like making a cannabis edible, but in something that stays liquid. Onset is faster, and it's another attempt to find an answer for her headaches.
Mar 4 2:38pm
Lots of books to move around?
Mar 4 2:39pm
That sounds like sheâ€™s gonna have a great time lol.

Oh yeah. Weâ€™re finally getting back to moving books back out of storage from the renovation.
Mar 4 2:40pm
Thank goodness.
Mar 4 2:40pm
Great place to lose yourself in music or audiobook (btw, lemme know if you need anything).
Mar 4 2:41pm
Will do! ^_^ Iâ€™m ready for this semester to be over so I can read for fun again.
Mar 4 2:43pm
At some point I want to check out that game you shared with me ages ago. Disco Elysian.
Mar 4 2:45pm
Elysium*** or whatever it was.
Mar 4 2:47pm
I think you might enjoy it! Lemme know if you need a pirated copy.
Mar 4 3:49pm
I think you may have already given it to me. I recall reaching it off of our resillio sync a few semesters ago and rediscovered it recently haha.
Mar 4 4:56pm
Oh, yeah, lol
