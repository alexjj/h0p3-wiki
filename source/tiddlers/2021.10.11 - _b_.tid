As the crisis grows, it's easy to find people who can criticize capitalism. It's less and less expensive to voice that opinion in many contexts, and that is why it is not much of a proxy or signal for figuring out if someone's actually a [[good]] person these days. Sacrifice is always fundamental to [[love]]. Anyone can complain about being coerced into being used as a mere tool, but it's another matter to recognize we, in fact, ought to become tools [[FTSO]] [[others]].

Imagine unironically taking life and relationship advice from Bojack. It's like thinking the characters on //The Office// are good people. ho. ly. shit.

Even sociopaths will utter, "It's about people." Lmao.

I'm hard pressed to come up with examples of complex economies that aren't ultimately reputation markets (and that's where parasitic sociopathy will always thrive). We don't have an absolute moral right to be different though. The Golden Rule effectively executed will use signaling and coercion to shape the individuals comprising the bodypolitik to conform, yet with a fitting set of spaces to be different, to defeat spirals of silence, and to guarantee anonymized access to our minds. There's something to be said for that MBA claim, "the role of government is to pick the winners," and hopefully [[irwartfrr]].

The ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱's [[hyperconversation]] is its own ~~h..~~context (and not in a gimmicky way), and I think this helps overcome some of postmodern [[art]]'s tendencies (and not merely as a thorough confrontation of another's subjectivity) to devalue aesthetics in favor of some other meaning (starved for anything [[salient]] in the flatness) to the point of being unapproachable to those lacking context (or at least offers a bridge to such a thing), but I can't say it's appealing to those with context though.
