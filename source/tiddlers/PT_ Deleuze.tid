; 1925-1995: Deleuze

* Matter and life are dynamic; we should see being not in terms of stable identities but in terms of difference.
* Philosophy is the art of forming, inventing, and fabricating concepts palpating the difference that disrupts all projects of identification.
* Philosophy does not consist in knowing; rather, it is categories like Interesting, Remarkable, or Important that determine success or failure.
* Being is univocal and immanent; it folds, unfolds, and refolds itself into the specific forms that constitute the world of our experience.
* The viewpoint of the human subject is not the only perspective; the lives (unfoldings) of other things (an organ, a group, an epoch, etc.) matter.
* Substance is temporal in character: the past is a realm of virtual differences that exist in the present in actualized form.
* Duration is a unity: not merely a unity of past and present, but of past, present, and future.
* The eternal return is the recurrence of difference itself; to affirm it is to set free the active and unpredictable forces of creativity.
* Tools, organs, individuals, groups, states, etc. and combinations of these can all be seen as "machines" in terms of the creative connections they make.
* "Machines" are not mechanisms; they evolve, mutate, and reconnect with other machines, in creative and unpredictable ways.
* Desire, seen machinically, is a creator of connections (sexual, political, etc.), not a lack that must be filled.
* Economic modes of production do not define machinic connections; it is the other way around.
* Our political thought must not be like a tree (with a definite structure) but like a rhizome with no beginning/end and no particular shape.
* We are composed of lines of rigid segmentarity (family-profession, etc.) and lines of flight carrying us across segments in unpredictable ways.
* The state does not mediate or liberate; it is parasitic, powerful, and oppressive - a force for conformity through abstract machines like discipline.
* Capitalism deterritorializes, but instead of freeing lines of flight, it captures and stifles them to serve its own purposes.
* Oedipus is an abstract machine of capitalism; it says that your desires are really directed towards your own family, placing them in the service of capital.
