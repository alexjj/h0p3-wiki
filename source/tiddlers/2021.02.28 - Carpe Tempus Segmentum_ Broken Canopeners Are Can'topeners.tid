title: 2021.02.28 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Broken Canopeners Are Can'topeners

[[TTTOTW]], Fireman Time!, some LolVods, and I'm not sure what else. 

Sleep was solid. [[Morning Routine]]. Hugs'n'bugs. Words of advice and assignments.

Sex and shower. The Triple Crown. Huzzah.

To my knowledge, a first for me: a person who does not live in my house was root on my machine today. I walked in my room, saw someone on Notepad.exe (leet) wandering the exact document (though it wasn't my unsaved/buffered copy) that was trying to talk about why the event was so special to me. I thought about waiting just to watch, but I thought it better to just say how I felt (and, I still completely failed at that; you'd have to see my face). In whatever ways we can, it feels good to be rooted in those we trust and love all the way down, no matter what. As I continue to experience, [[Intimacy]] is about not wanting [[privacy]] in some crucial respects.<<ref "v">>

My daughter, the spooky nerd, filled out our taxes with 4 others gathered around. Vapelyfe, no refund (`/sadface`, but I'm glad). 

She's too sore to walk. Aww yiss. So, straight to 1-on-1s in [[Family Time]], extended. Maybe 15 minutes isn't enough. Seems like these have been extra important.

My daughter does sound like her mom. A joke that kept coming up this evening. The adults losing their shit. Me and the offspring are the slowest. 

Was talking with my bro when I swear I saw something flicker behind him on the screen. Seemed like a mirage at first. I do have visual hallucinations, and I can't always trust my eyes. Oh, but I saw a workspace switch. He was like: I'm going to give you some privacy. Mmmmm.

<<footnotes "v" "I know it costs so much with me. I can't tell if you've seen the latest voldies. I almost kept those only on [[m16]], but they deserve to be [[shared]] with everyone (even if only quietly waiting for those who might wander deep into the forest to find the letterbox). You once wrote a quiet piece about being unsure that a group of people wouldn't have more fun just doing their own thing. I think wandering through the world spilling our guts together, leaving a trail to a living campfire for any who would wish to join us or experience or emulate or simply enjoy the warmth (and sometimes the coldness too!) with the [[other]] hits the spot.">>
