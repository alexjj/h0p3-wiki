Pop quiz: Does thinking blowjob (boris johnson) deserves to die make me as bad a person as boris johnson?

Pretty certain the answer is: NO! üòù

We've been here for 90 days, and we're finally into a groove.
Apr 7 12:21pm
My offspring aren't working as hard as I would like, but we've been working on what I call our TTPs (https://philosopher.life/#.tmpl:.tmpl .tdl .plan).
Apr 7 12:23pm
We've been watching vidyas. Lots of range. Watched an interview with a logician I admire. Sapolsky's Stanford classes on behavioral evolution. 3Blue1Brown's videos on linear algebra. Chillin' through Tiktok with them (very common for the youth their age). //Captain Fantastic// movie last night.
Apr 7 12:26pm
We pause a lot to talk and use our chalk/whiteboards.

They've been engaging in language arts with their mother (and she is by far the most talented reader and writer in the family). For a while I joined them as her student to be a senpai for them (https://philosopher.life/#The%20Lightning%20Thief). Hilarious.

[[j3d1h]] has not been designed her school, so we've been doing it for her. Trying to project her semesters for high school (she starts in the fall). Trying to make sure she's well-rounded (because I am teaching them as a specialist, and she needs proof).

They work in their wikis every day (we all do, http://j3d1h.philosopher.life/, http://1uxb0x.philosopher.life/, and http://k0sh3k.philosopher.life/). I engage in revision and discourse with them on school days for every entry: https://philosopher.life/#h0p3ful%20Review
Apr 7 12:31pm
The wikis radically alter how we engage in Family Time on Sundays, usually taking ~8 hours (https://philosopher.life/#Family%20Time.tmpl).
Apr 7 12:32pm
It's been a joy to read through each of our wikis together. That's gotten easier for us when they kick it ou. I hope to know my children and build memetic bridges and languages that few fathers have had the opportunity to have.
Apr 7 12:34pm
We've been engaged in the socratic method and dialectics (I call them dialectures since I do most of the talking) for years. We're finally at a point where we are doing philosophical analysis together (https://philosopher.life/#BAGD%3A%20%CE%A6%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CE%BF%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE%20%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%AC%CE%BB%CF%85%CF%83%CE%B7.tmpl).

There's ~1600 entries in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, and I hope to cover most of it with them before they get to college. We're practicing research methods that I wish I had been taught from the beginning. I'm hoping to help them become fluent in a technical vocabulary for describing the world and themselves.
Apr 7 12:47pm
There's also practical aspects. They are expected to fill out their doctor's forms and deal with the adults. They GPS and help me drive. They usually go shopping, make dinner, clean the house, etc. I have them navigate phone systems and masquerade as me or their mother to accomplish #adulting tasks. They have debit cards (5 bucks a week allowance) and I've recently acquired credit cards in our names for them to purchase groceries. They own their computers and build our technical infrastructures (pretty leet kids...reminds me, [[j3d1h]] revealed an roleplaying art project to us on Sunday: https://vixivivo.com/).
Apr 7 12:52pm
I prepare them for a psychopathic world as best I can.
Apr 7 12:53pm
I'm doing fine. I'm running a household, trying to make sure [[k0sh3k]] is being healthy in her work (and I am the pessimistic asshole who doubts everyone she works with, providing her a sounding board). I've been super anxious. Prepping food, since my predictions appear to be coming true.
Apr 7 12:55pm
I keep a frenetic pace on my wiki at this point, drowning in my work. I reach out to a lot of people, and try to keep in touch. Having a hard time developing relationships with our neighbors (nobody knows anyone here). Keeping our heads above water.
