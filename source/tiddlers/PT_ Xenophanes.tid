; 570-475 BC: Xenophanes

* We can only appear to get nearer to the truth, but since we cannot know the criterion of truth, we only perceive an illusory constructed conjecture of what we take to be true.
* All species construct gods in their own image; our anthropomorphized construction of our gods is for the sake of pleasing our egos.
