<<<
ONE of the most deep-seated contrasts, not to say conflicts, in western doctrinal traditions is that between Platonism[1] and Christian theology.
<<<

One helluva sentence! The contrast, to my eyes, is a couple extra {[[Axioms]]} that don't stand up to reason. I very much care about Christians standing up to reason wisely. To speak our minds already implicitly begs Plato's questions of metaphysics and speaking of the ineffable.

Depending on what you mean by the claim: maybe it really depends on who you are asking. I'm pretty worried that you aren't attempting fairness here (and what consists in fairness?).

The dialectics of memetic syncretism are profound. and I think you'll agree to that as well. A [[Straussian]] interpretation of Plato is, at the very least, instrumental to even the progressively revealed theologies of the Christian Memeplex. As you know, it is not easy to identify what consists in the Christian Memeplex, it's historiography, the stories nested in stories (let us say under metamodern realism), and the many serious ontological questions and commitments that arise from subjects naming objects. 

At least seriously working on the assumption (as we must [[Question Everything]]) that [[The Great Human Conversation]] is to no small degree a footnote to [[Saint Plato]] is part of the necessary hermeneutic humility to steel man the evolution of his memeplex (not just interpreting the conversation, but even in projecting where it could or would go if Plato himself [lived, re-lived, thought, and evolved] long enough to pick out the memetic strains and essential remnants of [[salience]] eternally, even into paradox). You pick this level of [[faith]] with your Biblical epistemic authority practices. That's quite a rabbithole. We're at a [[Question Everything]] level. To my eyes, Plato and his cronies (many of whom are the pillars of the Christian Memeplex) have pointed-out the only possible way for Christianity to make sense. One must answer Daoism wisely. Do you know //the way// to talk about that?<<ref "w">>

<<<
Historically speaking, the confrontation between the two traditions was most evident in those great formative centuries of Christian thought which lie between the end of the third century and the beginning of the seventh century, and was naturally at its most intense in urban centres like Alexandria, Athens, Constantinople and Antioch in which both Platonic and Christian schools flourished side by side.
<<<

Again, that depends on how you want to define Platonism/Neoplatonism. You are telling a classic story of Platonism here. I get it! That's where you have to start in the hermeneutic spiral/circle, and obviously, you have very little space here. Yes, I understand there are standard interpretations of Plato that don't worship his text like the Christian's worship theirs (despite spilling plenty of ink); it's really easy to make Plato a dumbass too, common to read him too literally and without paranoic charity in imagination, and it's extra tempting not to see the reinvention/rediscovery of Platonism in its kaleidoscope of contexts. It's sheer hubris to think that the Christian Memeplex hasn't been radically redefined (and perhaps even sublated) again and again by its "contrast" to Platonism through the millennia. Maybe we don't disagree yet, but it seems like it. It's not easy to tell.

Historically speaking, Platonism helps give birth to Christianity. The Second Temple and the Hellenization of Judaism is the transitional groundwork.

<<<
~~But the issues which came to the fore in this confrontation represents what~~ one might describe [''''[[The Great Human Conversation]]] as perennially divergent tendencies manifested by man in his attempts to give his doctrinal understanding an adequate linguistic formulation. 
<<<

Your contrasts-not-to-say-conflicts is a confrontation here, right? That's, of course, what we are trying to do right now. Linguistic representation is difficult to pin down too. I don't see how there is doctrine without The Word. Even "Someone Touched Me" is a form of communication! You still haven't escaped the Platonic vortex on your own view so far. Even the quietist wags their finger in contradiction. 

<<<
Nowhere is this more clear and more crucial than in respect of the differing estimates which emerged in this confrontation of the role that logic should play in relation to the formulation of divine Truth.
<<<

Who or what's formulation? What is a formulation here? I know that sounds so very pedantic. It turns out to be one of the fundamental questions being asked by Plato when we hit Hegel. And, this is clearly something that Christianity continues to wrestle with in many respects: there are huge differences among the learned Christians on this one too. This thing you are calling clear clearly isn't clear. 

<<<
The obstinacy with which Christian theologians maintained formulations that from the logical point of view were contradictory exposed them to the charge of blindness on the part of the Platonists; while the determination with which the Platonists insisted on reducing every illogical formulation to a logical formulation provoked counter-charges on the part of the Christian theologians that they, the Platonists, were merely victims of the tyranny of logic. Does anything more profound than recrimination based on mutual incomprehension lie behind these charges?
<<<

That is attempting to rewrite history. Do I get to charge you with oversimplifying and being a victim of the tyranny of your definitions here? Mutual incomprehension is something you are trying to force here, and I don't see why I should let you just help yourself to it.

Platonists^^tm^^ can bite the mystical contradictory bullet ([[The Dialetheia]] and [[Saint Hegel]] are extremely reasonable considerations in Platonism, even on the grounds of logic),<<ref "s">> and plenty of Christian theology (itself based in other philosophical systems that also took logic seriously) is based upon the assumption that we must rigorously employ logic in formulating a representation of divine Truth. You aren't going to be able to peel apart non-Platonic Christian theology from Platonic Christian theology easily either.

I suggest you are concerned with the worship of symbols. You have already lost the game: Plato represents representation, the sort syncretized into Christianity itself. There is no New Testament without it.

<<<
In ~~the~~ [a] Platonic perspective, metaphysical Reality is a subtly graduated structure descending from the undetermined One that is beyond Being through a series of determinations which eventually issue in the human soul. 
<<<

The "subtly graduated structure" can be a Platonic perspective, but a Platonist isn't required to make this move. "Beyond Being" is simply an unresolved matter in Platonism: you don't get to help yourself to that. Now it's my turn to offer at least a minimal alternative to defining Platonism: a belief in the ontological primacy of at least one thing-in-itself outside of physics necessary for having any epistemology. There you will see that Platonism and Christianity are in agreement, likely at multiple levels.

<<<
Here at once two points must be emphasized. The first point is that for the Platonists these determinations are not merely products of human thought which lack any objective basis in metaphysical Reality itself. On the contrary, they represent actual gradations of substance in the structure of this Reality.
<<<

I get that you are driving for a classic interpretation. I'll agree that a Platonist should be open to this ontological gradation claim, but I don't see why this is necessary for Platonism, including after consorting with the German Idealists. This is an open question not a shut book in Platonism.

<<<
The second point is that each determination subsequent to the One is characterized by a certain loss of reality and absoluteness, this loss being greater the lower the determination stands in the descending series. These two points together mean that Being, for instance, which represents the primal determination of the undetermined One, is in an actual and substantial manner distinguished from the One in divinis itself; and that the fact that Being stands in this way subsequent to the One signifies that Being possesses a lesser degree of absolute reality than that possessed by the One; and the same applies, in a gradually increasing fashion, to all those determinations which in their turn issue or emanate from Being and from what stands below Being. In other words, for the Platonists metaphysical Reality comprises a hierarchy of gradations each real on its own level but each possessing a degree of absoluteness and reality which depends on its relative proximity to the pre-ontological One, which alone may be described as absolutely real.
<<<

<<<
Christian theologians, on the other hand, refuse to admit these descending gradations of substance in metaphysical Reality.
<<<

Many Christian theologians have and do.
