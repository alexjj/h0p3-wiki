I support your rights to equality wherever it is profitable for me.

Is this a privileged advice? Advance careers by changing companies every 2 years, fret over the 15ish core principles not the current stack, don't anticipate making friends, be as honest as is useful to you because you can find a similarly high paying job in just a couple weeks, if you are called-in more than once a quarter then find a new job, all but one holy war of your choosing are irrelevant, exploit interns, don't meet your heroes, titles don't matter except that everyone believes they do, max out your 401ks, be nice because it's useful, always pay for continued education to at least be able to pretend you are competent, and it's more important to work on what you don't hate than what you like.

Calls to ignore most of the top end to focus on the tippy top are clear reactionary misdirections too. Own up to the responsibilities of your privilege.

Mods charge you with a crime, deliberate (if at all) in private, don't tell you what the charges are, and you can't defend yourself against the judgment formed and handed down to you. It was never about justice. And, if you get banned, the names of the mods become hidden to you, and they can mute you as well. Your only recourse is to continue making new accounts and jump through more hoops.

Is the ego a neural implant of 'the system' by which it communicates the market value of one's self-commodity while conflating survival with consumption?
