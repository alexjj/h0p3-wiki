title: 2020.09.22 - Prompted Introspection: The Self-Fulfilling Topic

!! What is the first thing you do when you wake up every morning? Why?

These days, [[Morning Routine]] is almost a euphemism. ( סּ ͜ʖ͡סּ). What's the first thing I do? I [[masturbate]].<<ref "s">> Surprise! The bastard is almost always ready to go, and I'm more than happy to help him out. Forget coffee.

That's how I know I'm extra privileged. When I have a full-time job alongside my vocations as a father, a teacher, and an extremely-online-retard, I don't have time to indulge.<<ref "a">> For most of my life, I've had to work to minimize the time between opening my eyes and getting out the door down to about 15 minutes. Life has changed though. Now I can even take 45 luxurious minutes to fantasize in full morning glory. It's dope (almost AF, literally-speaking). 

Why? [[WWDD]], of course. And, well, no one else is going to do it for me. It's not like my dick is going to suck itself (and, I wish I could: I would shave off a year of my life for that ability). Are you, dick? y u no suck urself? u suck. (˘ڡ˘)

I would have so much advice for 13yo [[h0p3]] too (actually, I wish I started this part of my journey much earlier, lol...but hiding the truth and abstinence-only condemnations to hell were super effective memes against my development).">>
