title: 2020.07.29 - TDL: Ensure Both Biden & DJT Die of CV19 Before Elections

* I mean, there's technically a chance I'd get this wish for 2020. 
* Fuck shopping. Fuck it all. Just hold out until Friday or Saturday.
** We could use a fruit though. Watermelon?
* Hey, you are officially behind, as usual. Enjoy, lulz.
** Seems like we all are. 
** You have an [[audit]] soon. C'mon.
** Plus you have that blasted occasion coming soon.
* The manboy should fix his room.
* Enjoy the time you have with your wife while she's still at home.
* You should go through your tools and clean your desk up. They've been hit hard recently.
