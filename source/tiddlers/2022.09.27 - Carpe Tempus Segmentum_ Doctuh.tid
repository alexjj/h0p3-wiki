title: 2022.09.27 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Doctuh

[[TTTOTW]]. Sleep by unknown time. 

Woke at 9:30? Back to sleepish.

//Skintime// with my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]]. [[Variety Creepy]] speaks.

Daughter's doc appointment was simple enough, nearly identical, and similar accents but different person. They had a hard time finding our pharmacy `/shrug`. I did my best to make myself scarce and demand my daughter do the talking, but they still seemed to want my input where I felt it unnecessary (they've plenty of evidence that she's competent, articulate, etc.). Smooth going, lots of [[silence]] though. 

[[TTTOTW]].

Meeting with the doc. They were 20 minutes late. I had some cookies and [[TTTOTW]] while waiting. They do a lot of student teaching on the job while remote. They weren't sure, but still felt that poison ivy with bacterial infection was the best answer. Want me to take a very low concentration bleach bath, maybe stay away from the cats?, non-drowsy anti-histamines, strong steroid cream, and antibiotics. Sad the signs didn't point to fungal. What the hell do I know? Cool. Whatever works.

Offspring came down to grind. We got little done, but at least had the chance to chat. Necessitamos. These tom yum noodles are tight.

[[5c0ut]] came down to [[The Den]] to chill a bit. More dealing with Ed and Ray. Otherwise, seems pretty smooth. Found it is a yearly contract position, unless they have significant summer work to do (and, they very well may). 

Mi amor called. We talked on her way back. Gotta say it again: damned good use of our time given how compressed her schedule has grown. Her pick for the Art librarian position is still in the lead. I hope she will continue to slowly eat away at the Bourgeois signaling bullshit. 

Bits of time spent with [[5c0ut]], [[j3d1h]], and [[ASK]]. 

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. //Inform the Men!// Meditation. [[TTTOTW]]. 

[[Family Gathering]] was delicious. We had fish'n'chips. I will continue to argue the fish was baked perfectly. We have moved onto //Mr. Robot//, in which my daughter and I are poking holes in what does not make sense. Show is pretty cool so far.

[[JRE]] called toward the end of the meal. Ear infections all around. He had a shitty day at work, literally, in his hair. Buttwater no good. [[Rb]] survived meeting her old co-workers, and she's got real work to do now. Tired. [[Q]] has not hit max adorbability factor yet. Both boys are enjoying being physically active, [[Bn]] cannonball leaping into his father's arms, and [[Q]] trust-falling (and once launching while vertical). [[Q]]'s adoption paperwork has been started. May it be quick, painless, and without additional pregnancies from the biomom. [[Q]] is pickin' up colors quickly. Talked [[Project Ascension]], TBC, and how little time my man has to do any of this. 

Bugged mi amor.

//Skintime// + //Star Wars// with my sympaticon. 

Put mi amor to bed. An interesting tussle between the grad students and deans on all the extra things the Anglican students are required to do (a list well beyond grad school requirements of any other kind of program). Justin is flaking out, maybe. Few have any idea what consists in moving toward [[The Telos]] with every fiber of one's being. Both sides have something important right that I hope will be made explicit. Not my wife's battle.

[[TTTOTW]]. Clarinet.

//The Walk// with my sympaticon.
