title: 2021.08.20 - Prompted Introspection: The Cogito

!! Which of your beliefs would be difficult to change, even in the face of overwhelming evidence?

This is a keeper, Samwise. Thank you. It's [[Question Everything]] territory. There's a few types of directions to go here. There are beliefs I have that are so categorical, I'm not even sure what kind of evidence one could give me to cause me to change 'em. Those might not be the beliefs you have in mind, but I think it's okay if we start there.

I've been dealing with a lot of "present"-oriented language lately, so why not this question too, eh? Okay. It would be difficult to convince me that I'm not experiencing anything at all. We are in apodictic territory here (so, go ahead and say, "no fair!" :P). There are many routes to attack the claim (most of them adjacent or side-channel attacks), of course, but they all seem to utterly fail to damage this particular conviction. Normally, it is easier for me to try to come up with even an ad hoc body of hypothetical evidence and argumentation against one of my beliefs. I don't even know where to begin with this one though. Any attempt would seem self-refuting. Attending to any belief is already overwhelming evidence. The modernist's cogito remains a stellar piece to our foundation (necessary, but insufficient).
