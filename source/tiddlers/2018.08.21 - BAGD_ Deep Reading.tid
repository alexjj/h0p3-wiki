title: 2018.08.21 - BAGD: Deep Reading

I desperately want you to engage in deep reading with consistency. I've told you this a thousand times. It's on record now. It's fundamental to empathizing, virtualizing experience machines in your head, living narratives, and walking in others' shoes. This is what truly educated people get which others do not in a ton of cases.

Sometimes not being nice just is the kind thing to do. You must prevent confabulation in a profound systematic way though. this is dangerous territory.

You cannot just "yep" or "yes sir" me. You have to try to disagree. You have to dare to be wrong. You have to wrestle. You have to confront the emotional aspects of relationships with each other and ourselves.

You have to radically think outside my box and demonstrate to me your virtue in doing so. You must learn to show your work as you think for yourself.

<<footnotes "2021.08.22-1" "I'm going to add the link here, even if only [[FTSO]] backlinking. I want to engage in that practice without having to constantly note it. Such a paranoid [[audit]] can be done from the snapshots.">>

<<footnotes "2021.08.22-2" "I like how this is phrased, as it doesn't claim that we must continue the conversation. It makes room for [[silence]] and more.">>
