title: 2020.08.26 - Wiki Review: Oozing Out

* [[2020.08.25 - Prompted Introspection: Yum]]
** I have no idea what it's going to be like speaking with them as adults. I predict that I simply won't be able to understand some of their interests well enough to be anything more than a noob asking questions. 
*** I predict they won't give a fuck about any of my recommended projects either here. At least they'll have a headstart.
* [[2020.08.25 - TDL: Spring Rolls]]
** Wishful thinking. You did alright. I wish you did something with your reading, but if you can't, then you can't.
* [[2020.08.25 - Wiki Review: Isekai]]
** I've been lucky enough to run into several [[pleft]]ists lately. It's harder to reach out to people on HN, sadly.
** Though we've still had plenty of oddjobs and chores to get done together. 
* [[2020.08.25 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: *slaps roof of his wiki* You Can Fit SO Much Bullshit In This!]]
** Completed...and, I think I did make a friend. Dope. Wasn't clear at first.
* [[2020.08.25 - /b/]]
** Engage schizomode. From [[Family Time]] though. Sat on it for a bit. Couldn't accept anything other than a [[/b/]] though.
* [[Freud and Beyond: A History of Modern Psychoanalytic Thought]]
** Definitely mixed feelings. Walking through what I've seen, I don't see enough philosophical foundation. I suggest they are looking for something else here.
* [[Encrypted: Tapeda]]
** `/salute`
* [[2020.08.25 - Tapeda: The Snuggle Is Real]]
** Completed. I'm hoping [[Tapeda]] will make a wiki. Seems like a great fit.
* [[2020.08.24 - Tapeda: The Spirit of Borges]]
** It's nice to not feel alone and enjoying the comforts of lettin' it ooze out.
