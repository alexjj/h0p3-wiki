title: 2020.07.20 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Conflate Value Creation With Extraction

* Woke at 11
** I'll take it. Half-assed sleep through the night, but it was enough.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* [[MWGhandi]] commented that I'm more interesting that my wife, lol. It's only because I'm crazy though.
** I think it's funny that my wife has had to say to many people: yeah, that's what he's like in-person too.
* My son fared poorly in our accountability meeting, and my daughter better.
** Several computing problems went poorly for him (and, apparently, his mother had told him to fix it too).
** I mean, they watched a fucking movie and took notes. Sounds fun.
** I know they aren't trying in math. They know it too. Up to them.
* [[h0p3ful Review]]: Daughter convinced me to hold off (though she failed to deliver yesterday), and my son's was abysmal. 
* Read+Write+Walk+Talk
* Thinking through my wife's day with her.
* Whole family watched DJT's Fox interview.
** We had to pause many times.
* [[Guitar]]
** Molecularized and purged. No reason to waste so many tiddlers.
*** Sublime Text is still my goto editor. It gets the job done (or gets me close enough to finish it by hand).
** Couldn't find my tuner (I'm not saying my offspring did it...).
*** Good news is that my piano tuning kit has a nice Korg tuner.
**** What I do is tune my guitar and act like the reason it doesn't sound good has nothing to do with my complete lack of skill. See, it's OFF by a hair, that's why. :P.
* Vapelyfe & Scarlet J. Bunch.
** My wife roared laughing when she saw it. It's well done.
* Read+Write
* Dialectures
** I'm still working to convince my son to exercise during his 5 minute breaks. There are those in my family who thank me for walking with me decades later. It's how we think sometimes. Diffuse mode. I want him to take his walk+talk time seriously. For an autist, it's a license to live in your head for a time.
* The Walk
** Thought quite a bit about [[kicks]]' latest work.
** Audiophile we've come across. I didn't hear his name, but we chatted about music some. 
** Nature is the apex predator in many contexts
** No one gives a shit that they are dying in some awful sense
** Morlock and Eloi; Slave/Master Dialectics
* Read+Write
* [[Family Gathering]]
** We scrounged because it was too late to make dinner.
** [[Debatable]]
* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 4
