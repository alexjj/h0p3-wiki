title: 2022.12.06 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Chad GPT-3

//Hopefully, it will produce just enough bullshit to hold these together in this world.//

Woke at 12:30. I feel better, but that wasn't even close to enough. [[TTTOTW]]. Broth + English Muffin with peanut butter + Ginger Ale shots with my sympaticon. Spent a long time testing GPT-3. Not trying to get it to do much work, but trying to get a feel for it overall. Lots of approaches. Can't shake it: artificially naive, toxically positive, clearly bent to appear aligned, etc. Who could not be impressed though? Every incarnation is better. Also, GPT-3 actually provided a link I found interesting: https://www.kammerl.de/.

Mi amor is prepping. 5 hours, not enough, but she's in good spirits. Plans. Much needed skishes. I enjoy fucking with her as she picks her jewelry (gently misplacing them a few inches). Benign violations. It is rare that I joke with anyone. I'm a very serious man, as many have picked out. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Laundry. Brain is wired, having a hard time falling asleep, but I did. Maybe 10?

Woke at 2:30. Not great sleep, but good enough. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. [[5c0ut]] was having a bad day, messaging family chat. An employee got physical with them, both being written up, HR isn't interested in truth or doing what's right. Mi amor gave him good advice. I wish someone had talked with me about that long ago.

The offspring came down to grind. My daughter already had an account, and my son made one. Trying out the various GPT-3 offerings. They had a blast. [[TTTOTW]].

Mi amor called. Saw [[5c0ut]] come out. Gave him a hug while on the phone with mi amor.

Mi amor tried on a dress she has to wear to the thing. Cute. //Raw Skintime//. //Inform the Men!// Meditation.

Chilled some with my sympaticon. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Offspring said they've been having trouble with [[DarkMX]] too. Today it stopped working for us. Hrm. Chat with [[DarkMX]] forum and [[ASmith]].

[[Family Gathering]] was solid. Stew and biscuits, ginger ale too. //Mr. Robot//. [[TTTOTW]]. Cleaning up files. 

[[JRE]] called. Had me find [[5c0ut]] and wake him up to give him a hug on behalf. Feeling fat, hard to fit pants. Know the feel. Attempted to replace thermostat in [[Rb]]'s vehicle, as it is not heating up. Workin' on generators moreso than standard electrical things this week. Off the addy, gonna move on. [[Bn]] can climb over the gate, so he was shown how to open it instead. Worried about the stairs, and [[Q]] does not follow any instructions (much like a cat, even though he understands). [[Q]] has been adding a stutter to his requests, particularly when his brother's request was successful. Thinkin' about doorbell camera surveillance and China.

Hugs'n'bugs. Put mi amor to bed. Cookies and fizzy water. [[TTTOTW]] + //The Fog of War//. Searched for rooming options for my sympaticon. 

Sleep by 10?
