You both like Help Me, and Sad.
Stranger: hi
You: Whoa. Hello.
You: I did not anticipate these tags would pick anyone up.
You: My name is h0p3.
You: Can I be of use to you today?
Stranger: No thank you
Stranger: But can I help you?
You: Alright.
You: Perhaps. I am working on a number of problems.
Stranger: Maybe I can help you
You: These are key topics: https://philosopher.life/#Lifetime%20Projects
You: Also, if you are here to help people with those tags, I'd rather you continue to hunt for them.
You: And, I'm [[grateful]] to know you exist.
Stranger: Thanks
You: What brings you here today?
Stranger: I wanted to try to help people
Stranger: And
You: Indeed.
Stranger: I really like your website
You: That is very high praise thank you. And, should the occasion arise, please do not hesitate to [[contact]] me: https://philosopher.life/#Contact%20h0p3
You: How often do you come on omegle?
Stranger: I don’t know
You: (it's been about 7 weeks for me, I believe)
Stranger: Everyday?
Stranger: Why
You: Oh, no, I mean I've not been here in 7 weeks.
You: I've been here maybe 10-20 times this year.
You: It's an odd place.
You: I'm open to being here every day, if that is necessary.
Stranger: Yeah sometimes it’s really odd here
You: It's interesting what degrees of [[anonymity]] bring out of us, no doubt.
You: What do you do to survive in the world?
Stranger: Breath
You: Step 1 =)
Stranger: And what about you
You: I'm a basement-dweller, a hiki, a retard neckbeard who lives on his [[monster]]. Seeking [[justice]] as best I know how with what little I have.
You: I am a very privileged person.
You: Family and the belief that we can still save the world [[help]] me survive.
Stranger: Cool
You: What do you think matters most?
Stranger: On this world?
You: In all possible worlds.
Stranger: Safety
You: For the sake of what?
Stranger: Everything
You: My [[daughter|j3d1h]] just chimed in, she says: "Ask if Hitler should be safe....[typing]...don't do that."
You: I presume safety from Hitler makes a ton of sense.
You: Not everything ought be preserved or saved I take it.
You: (my offspring are sitting on the couch behind me grinding on their machines, working on their projects: they shouldersurf often enough)
Stranger: Okay
You: `/nod`
You: I am concerned with the safety of [[others]]. It's part of why I'm out here trawling.
Stranger: Thank you for caring
Stranger: Gl
Stranger has disconnected.

You too, homie. Not just an honor: I'm [[grateful]] and filled with some [[hope]].

You both like philosophy.
Stranger: hi
You: Hello There! =)
You: What brings you here today?
Stranger: search for connection lol
Stranger: wbu
You: That makes sense. That's not easy to achieve in this world. I [[hope]] to be of use to you, [[nomad]].
You: I'm here to [[Find The Other]].
You: What kinds of connections are you looking for?
Stranger: who is "The Other"?
Stranger: Is that a name or a title?
You: I do not know well enough, my friend: https://philosopher.life/#Find%20The%20Others
You: It's probably an overloaded term in philosophy, from what I can tell.
Stranger: oh ok
Stranger: im looking for a gf ig, or someone cute at least
You: Unfortunately, I do not qualify.
You: I know the hunt for [[love]] is crucial.
Stranger: saddd
You: Do you [[aim]] to find a person who will engage in philosophical discourse with you? Is it a dealbreaker if they aren't invested in the pursuit of wisdom?
Stranger: today? no
Stranger: for a long time partner? yes
You: So, I suppose hunting for short-term partners until you land "The One" is part of the strategy here. Does help with the loneliness, and it's more than a bandaid, I take it.
Stranger: yeee
You: You been on the meat grinders like Tinder?
Stranger: yes lol
Stranger: i hate it
You: That shit is awful.
Stranger: my best traits come thru mid convo
Stranger: but i cant start anything engaging to start with!
Stranger: nor am i appealing in images and bios
Stranger: how old are u?
You: I am 36 yo, my friend.
Stranger: fun
You: https://philosopher.life/#The%20Vault%20of%20h0p3
Stranger: are u on twitter
Stranger: i feel like i know u
You: I'm nobody, hehe, but I'm glad to speak with you, even after this conversation on omegle ends, https://philosopher.life/#Contact%20h0p3
You: I technically have a Twitter account, but it's dead. It exists for cornercases.
You: And, to signal to some that I am listening.
Stranger: cool
Stranger: coooool
Stranger has disconnected.

Cooooooolsiieeeeeeeess.
