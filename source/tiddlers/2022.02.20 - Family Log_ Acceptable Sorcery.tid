** Sore legs, calcium build-up, very tight muscles lately, anxiety
* h0p3
** Solid, except the fluffy parts. Time has been flying. Good times. Walks and shopping got me out of the house, and I'm glad I did. 
* ASK
** Panic attacks, brain pain, vertigo, difficulty sleeping, sullen stomach aches, inability to concentrate, low blood sugar, everything low grade hurts, some things are spiking unpleasantly. I'm okay.
** Allergic reaction.
*** Haha, Yeah, I poisoned myself again. I figured out what did it though, so it wont happen by accident again. By accident, lol.

!! What was interesting to you last week?

* Family bets on how much times it will snow until Spring. Unfortunately, the most deserving will probably lose. 
** No, I might win.
* //Dead Poets Society// rocked.
* Mochi lives.
** Marshmallow Mochi is the best!
** I don't know why it is named after something so disgusting. The car deserves better.
* Closer to our passports, scheduling travel for the summer.
* Hired two more student workers - now I might get the MRC stuff done on time!
* I was added to a taskforce before I was asked, which was interesting.
* I was also asked to join the Alum Council for SLIS, which is cool!
* Watching Him work was enjoyable and I learned a bunch. We walked, that was nice. I made a lot of tasty treats.
* I've been trying to figure out what game I'm in the mood for.

* 1uxb0x
** I'm happy I had an actual reasonable argument.
** Thank you for working on your room, sir.
** Thank you for thinking hard with me about technology. I know it's not always fun (our rabbitholes can be daunting too!), and I respect how you don't give up and work to control your emotions. Being able to do what you don't enjoy doing is not an easy discipline, and you make progress because of it.
** Thank you for the salad. You've been making them with more variety, and I appreciate that.
** Congrats on finishing your permaculture book! I'm looking forward to what you think of the Oculus game!
** Thank you for the hug while I was having that panic attack. You have a kind heart.
** i'm loving your work on narnia, keep it up!
* j3d1h
** my cel shading has improved drastically.
** Thank you for scrubbing in the bathroom. I know it's not a fun task.
** Thank you for being willing to interpret almost anything for me. You're damned good at it, and I think it's in part because you understand the authors and the audiences so well that you can connect the dots as you do. It's almost miraculous watching how fast you do it at times too. I admire how you aren't wedded to your perspective in this exploration too; it's an open-ended pursuit. May that approach serve you well.
** Thank you for the perfectly cooked fish. 
** Thank you for working remotely with me this week. We all benefit from thinking about your code.
** I love worldbuilding with you! Discussing your worlds and finding ways to storytell together is fun!
** I've also had fun comparing Wordle scores with you. <3
** You have excellent taste in media.Thank you for the shares and suggestions.
** Thank you for being understanding with me. <3.
* k0sh3k
** I think I did a good job researching cars, and car dealerships, and loans for financing, and just the whole car buying thing this time. Maybe this one will last more than a year!
** You were quite thoughtful about handling that much money. Thank you.
** Though no one else might see it so well, your hiring process is something you've improved upon significantly, with the exception of your fairness and serving those in need, which has always been consistently exemplary. I could imagine you'd write a chapter on this one; library students should know what you do. Maybe it's something you'll bring up in the alum council.
** Your patience with malicious fools should become a legend. 
** I enjoyed getting the passport pictures with you this week. Your humor, and watching you interact with h0p3, made for a fine memory.
** Thank you for searching for books for us.
** i've had a lot of fun doing wordle stuff with you! (your messages are usually a reminder to do that, lol.)
* h0p3
** I'm disgusting in useful and interesting ways often enough. I like that about myself.
** Thank you for the massage; it really helped!
** My heart lights up every time you walk into the room. I love when you circle your pace path. I get to feel like that over and over again.
** Thank you for pushing me to do my room
** You are a living dictionary.
** i know you don't care or whatever, but you've been making good-looking outfits more often.
* ASK
** You have courage and gumption to start from scratch with your instrument. It's a terrible feeling sometimes, and you've an attitude toward it that I respect. 
** Thank you for integrating your material and time and brains into our lives. The spice organization is but one example!
** I read every word, madame, and it is my honor and pleasure. Thank you. I love you. <3.
** Thank you for walking with me even when it's stupid cold and you're tired. 
** Thank you for telling me what you want. I need that.
** The person in Aldi is correct: your presence brightens the world. That is one of your greatest gifts, imho. 
** It's a joy watching you taste things that generate strong sensations. =D. 
** Thank you for breaded tenderloins. Never had them before, and they are exceptionally good.
*** The very fancy cookies, dark chocolates, and fudge are incredible too. The meals were delicious. Thank you!
** You are so thoughtful about your negative feelings toward others, particularly the most expensive ones. I wish I had even half of that virtue.
** Thank you for the special macarons! They were fantastic!!
** Your kitchen sorcery is almost acceptable. Good job.
** Thank you for doing a science experiment for us!
** thanks for the fudge, i might just eat it all. :)
