title: 2020.06.26 - Prompted Introspection: Vidya, Breh

!! Tell about something that you and your siblings used to do together.

[[2019.05.20 - Prompted Introspection: Sibling Play]] reminds me of a childhood I often want to forget. Even today, my brother [[JRE]] speaks to me of Rachel, which I'm reasonably confident is a triangulation from my donors. I must still face the facts with integrity though. The same for this [[prompt]].

We played video games on consoles and computers. We didn't tend to play with each other (though I wish there were more cooperation-based games available to us), but we watched each other play often. Endless hours on these skinnerboxes were spent. It reminds me of watching the youtubes vidyas of people reacting to other youtube vidyas. Video games were useful in a number of respects (and everyone should have to play them), but overall, I'm convinced they tended to be a hedonic soma and babysitter for us. Using drugs with my brothers has become a wonderful pattern though. It's dope.
