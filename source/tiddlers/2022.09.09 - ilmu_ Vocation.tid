8:57:45 PM - [[ilmu]]: Seems like I am well on my way towards becoming one of the increasingly many people who are getting ghosted to death, looking over my life I don't know where exactly it went wrong, but it's not possible to continue like this. Soon I will need to make a change and it will be in the direction of abandoning information technology completely. It will anyway converge on whatever the math says is true and I have no interest in playing hero to make it happen slightly faster or whatever. People seem to be content in their ignorance and I should be too. This poverty thing and medical problems and the whole uphill battle with nothing but shit coming downstream, it is just too much. I'd appreciate it if people don't break their silence for this message, I am not asking for that, you guys are already here.. much love! What I mean is more that I need to also get to be a person, I'm reaching thirty and all my life is just this project and nobody cares. I need to move on. I'll wait and work for a couple of more months at least (since there is still some hope in my outbox) but I quit if nothing changes by new years eve.

6:25:15 AM - [[h0p3]]: You don't need to respond to this. I'm walking through your writing, and I'm not through most of it (I'm taking notes and responding). I'm thinking about what you said yesterday in general. Would you be interested in maintaining a [[hyperconversation]] with me via one of your sites as a [[public self-model]]? You don't have to know now. It can be later. Though I am in [[Reply Mode]], I do not ghost people. The evidence is in my ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±. Maybe you will take a break, but I would be surprised if you didn't come back to the project (I did, and I'm 37, and I've been working on this problem for quite a while too). Even if you don't work on this particular project, I'm happy to maintain a relationship. It's alright if you don't want to as well. I'm a pretty expensive person to maintain a relationship with.
6:15:15 PM - [[ilmu]]: heh actually you are kinda like my dream person
6:15:23 PM - [[ilmu]]: and the bar is kinda low for things changing tbh
6:15:29 PM - [[ilmu]]: I have faith things will work out 
6:17:00 PM - [[ilmu]]: what I expected to happen when I wrote the original 18hr thing (that I called a "whitepaper" but now refer to more as "decleration of intent") was that people would discuss it somewhere (hackernews or whatever) and that it would serve as a bottom for the first metadatalattice.. it was for the longest time what datalisp.is redirected to.. a ipfs gateway hosting that CID.
6:18:08 PM - [[ilmu]]: but yeah idk I need to find some income sources so I may need to go elsewhere, I will know more tomorrow, I have an interview with anoma tomorrow
6:25:32 PM - [[ilmu]]: by the way, can you see backlogs for channels in this matrix server?
6:26:07 PM - [[ilmu]]: it works for telegram but I haven't checked by makign new account or whatever if it works here.
6:26:19 PM - [[ilmu]]: I see that the backlog is not available in some rooms (of other ppl) that I've joined
6:27:26 PM - [[h0p3]]: I can see all the way back to the creation of 4 rooms. 
6:27:43 PM - [[ilmu]]: cool thanks
6:28:13 PM - [[h0p3]]: I hope you get the job. Not easy to survive in the world. What do you hope to do at Anoma?
6:28:28 PM - [[ilmu]]: I'm hoping they pay me to do datalisp
6:28:50 PM - [[h0p3]]: I'm glad that I get to think about your intent and reasoning about all the pieces that have to come together. It's a project that requires many people (as you know).
6:28:57 PM - [[h0p3]]: That would be sick. 
6:29:12 PM - [[h0p3]]: `/fingers-crossed`
6:29:42 PM - [[ilmu]]: yeah this thing is really only worthwhile as a community thing, communication technology is useless for an individual sitting in his room
6:29:46 PM - [[h0p3]]: The creators of [[Aether]] are also struggling in this respect. A common theme, as you talk about, is how hard it is to make a living while contributing to FLOSS.
6:29:50 PM - [[ilmu]]: it's what is so frustrating about all this xD
6:30:41 PM - [[ilmu]]: I could program more and do more but my motivation is so much drawn from having a shared goal and people to work with
6:30:48 PM - [[h0p3]]: I think talking to ourselves is incredibly valuable. Even were I to be completely airgapped, I'd still rely upon some kinds of communication tech.
6:31:13 PM - [[ilmu]]: okay, I take the opposite view in many respects, I've travelled all over the world and never taken a picture for example
6:31:22 PM - [[ilmu]]: it's also why I am so lazy to edit explanations and whatever
6:31:31 PM - [[h0p3]]: Fascinating. I am not a picture taker either.
6:31:46 PM - [[ilmu]]: the thing is, bureaucracy is smaller than the real world
6:31:59 PM - [[ilmu]]: waking people up to the idea that we are talking to other people in the real world is harder than it seems
6:32:10 PM - [[h0p3]]: Indeed.
6:32:51 PM - [[h0p3]]: And, I worry that the distance and [[anonymity]] of technology only reveals who people really are if they weren't forced to be vulnerable while communicating offline. 
6:33:09 PM - [[h0p3]]: Though, I have met many exceptions, people who are kind on and off the wire. We do it for them.
6:33:20 PM - [[ilmu]]: yep
6:33:20 PM - [[h0p3]]: and the possibility of people like them.
6:33:38 PM - [[ilmu]]: for sure, I've been fighting for the rights of the children basically
6:33:47 PM - [[ilmu]]: all my life I just wanted to figure out how to improve the education system in iceland
6:33:49 PM - [[ilmu]]: that was basically it
6:33:51 PM - [[h0p3]]: Preach, yo.
6:34:01 PM - [[ilmu]]: and just honestly chasing that problem all the way brought me to this
6:35:28 PM - [[h0p3]]: I can appreciate how difficult it can be to maintain [[hope]] in the face of what we know is before us. 
6:35:53 PM - [[h0p3]]: Goodwill is like a priceless jewel. Intention is sometimes all we have. 
6:36:47 PM - [[h0p3]]: How'd you end up traveling the world?
6:39:33 PM - [[ilmu]]: I was a world of warcraft addict from iceland, my friends in the game were from all over and of all ages.. when I got back to reality at 12 I just realized how small my silo was and I got a very strong urge to escape it and see the rest of the world
6:39:48 PM - [[ilmu]]: year after I stayed in russia for the summer with some family
6:40:01 PM - [[h0p3]]: I'm a WoW addict myself. 
6:40:04 PM - [[ilmu]]: when I was 17 I competed in the international mathematical olympiad in argentina
6:40:26 PM - [[ilmu]]: then I did a travel through asia after I finished high school
6:40:30 PM - [[ilmu]]: I did a year abroad in uni in australia
6:40:41 PM - [[ilmu]]: I hitchhiked back from australia while studying a semester
6:40:46 PM - [[ilmu]]: okay from iran, I flew to iran
6:41:02 PM - [[ilmu]]: then at some point I also did a trip around east africa 
6:41:08 PM - [[ilmu]]: ending in me getting beat in the head with a roc k
6:41:09 PM - [[h0p3]]: When you got out of dodge, you got out of dodge.
6:41:21 PM - [[ilmu]]: then I spent some time in europe after that
6:41:28 PM - [[ilmu]]: doing M.Sc. and hitchhiking around
6:41:52 PM - [[h0p3]]: `/nod`. [[Nomad]]ic.
6:42:15 PM - [[h0p3]]: Often see myself as wandering the desert, hunting for what matters, doing what I can to construct The City.
6:43:04 PM - [[ilmu]]: yeah I have heard there are three types of religious experience
6:43:18 PM - [[ilmu]]: weekly church, monestary, desert enlightenment
6:43:26 PM - [[ilmu]]: I am definitely a person who falls in the last category
6:43:36 PM - [[ilmu]]: lots and lots and lots of time alone digging through the internet or the world
6:44:04 PM - [[ilmu]]: but after I started to understand religion a bit more I also see now how the other two types work and how I was avoiding them until I fell into the third type
6:44:50 PM - [[h0p3]]: Your work does strike me as being quite religious. 
6:45:23 PM - [[ilmu]]: hehe
6:45:30 PM - [[ilmu]]: I gtg I'll be back tmrw
6:45:51 PM - [[h0p3]]: Take it easy, homie.
