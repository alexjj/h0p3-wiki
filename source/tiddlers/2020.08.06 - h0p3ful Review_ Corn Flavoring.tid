*[[Emacs]]
** I'm excited to see you try. I know it won't be fun for quite a while. I'm hoping it's one of those things that will eventually pay for itself enough that you'll change your mind about my decision here.
*[[Notage Ti.67]]
** This is much closer to what we talked about. I think your notage is improving, sir.
*[[2020.08.05 – Antipleonasm Analysis: Love is devoting more than 50$.]]
** I agree that [[love]] really shines when it costs the most. You might say that you agree with the claim and aim to extend it. That is what you are doing. 
** It's not just time either. It's expensive to try to flesh it out further here. Energy seems to be at stake here too, for example. Some hours costs way more than others.
*[[2020.08.05 – Carpe Diem: No computers? Then books!]]
** Why is it gone? That sucks.
*** I'm sad to see you didn't just try again. It only had to be one sentence. You failed to write a single sentence, which is all I asked for. Note, I know you could write that right now just from your memory of the walk alone (and we have pictures). 
**** I'm going to pick out defection for you.
** I'm sorry it wasn't a good "early" day that day. =/. On average, your days have improved. Ups and downs.
*[[2020.08.05 – Prompted Introspection: I don't know and yes]]
** Continue to check your tooling, and take your grammar in school seriously. This is a chance to move from 80% to 98%. One or two more big pushes, I think you'll be over the primary hump (afterward, you will have to decide if you give a shit what the English Lords think of your rhetoric; you'll have done your part as an autist). 
** It's still not clear "why." We can infer some of it, but you should connect the dots further for us all. For you and me, son, it is better to overconnect the dots than under in more contexts than the average person. Our goal is to turn up the word and dot-connecting count and then start to filter it down to what matters in the context. 
*[[2020.08.05 – TDL: Zeno of Sh...]]
** Lmao. =). Alright, I'm shuttin' up. You know how I feel and think about the matter.
*** As long as you deliver the goods, you can break all the mere conventions and talk all the trash you want. I still take your work seriously though, and I hope you do too.
** There is flavor in here. Corn-flavor at the very least.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** You should grow [[RSS]] out. I think you'll be glad you did. Feeling comfortable in curating what you see is valuable, and starting young will make it so it can feel second nature to you.
*** Though, obviously, we are in a lot of trouble given where the interwebs is heading. At the very least, you'll have an idea of what could have been or what has been.
** [[2019.08.06 – Prompted Introspection: $100,000 on the floor.]] is cute. Good problem, eh?
** I'm somehow surprised that it has been //two// years since you had your fishtank, [[2018.08.06 -- Fish]]. Wow. Time has flown. It feels so gunky, blurry, and much closer than that to me.
