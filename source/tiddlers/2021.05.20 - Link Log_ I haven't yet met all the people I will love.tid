*** She can't sing, but it doesn't matter at all. Literally, hypnotized (//gazed// upon this clip several dozen times [and I never thought softcore pornography could own me like this again]). I can hear her it talking to me. Calling me (sawceplzNE1?). Right thar is my vocation (I'm on a //simp//le mission). God bless us all. Virtue signal all over me, please. Maybe we should go back to monke? Like, I'm growing convinced that ancient people saw a lot more of this than we get to (I don't think you can teach that either). `/sigh`. I can't do anarcho-primitivism, `/shudder`, eww. But, I am strictly a caveman watching this. I have a renewed appreciation for the arts, dancing in particular.
