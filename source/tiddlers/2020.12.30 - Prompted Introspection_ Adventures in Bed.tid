title: 2020.12.30 - Prompted Introspection: Adventures in Bed

!! What's one of the most adventurous things you've ever done in bed?

{[[Dreams]]} during sleep and ketamine have been the most adventurous things I've done in bed. I am not able to speak effectively about my [[phenomenology]] of these activities, and my memory of them and lucidity has been poor (but improving). My bed is a safe place to escape my awareness of the rest of the world. Sometimes, my bed is the only safe place in the world to think or feel or experience some risky, painful, and difficult things.
