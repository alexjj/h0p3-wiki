I [[hope]] you'll be able to forgive me for being so slow. I am thinking about you and many [[others]]. Even though I am somewhat manic, I'm socially glacial and autistic.

<<<
Hello, h0p3. I found you through [[Kicks]] Condor. Seeing your HN comments about pen pals, I decided to mail you. 
<<<

Hell yeah! I'm really glad you took the time to hit me up. It's my honor to meet you, [[nomad]]. Let me know if you need any [[help]]. You'll have to pick out what is [[salient]] with me in our [[hyperconversation]].

<<<
I admire you and your life of questing. And my dankometer, trained on you, produces a higher rating than it does for anyone else, save perhaps Gwern.
<<<

Indeed, [[gwern]] spits fire. I doubt I'll be able to catch up. I'm glad to have achieved this dankness rating though. Are you a fan of cannabis or any other substances?

<<<
You said: "[[Make lemonade and grow a forest of wisdom from what you shit out of your mind|/b/]]."

My lemony shit forest is my website. I don't aim to publicly self model (I'm a bit of a private person) but I like sharing my flavor, especially when I think it will bring joy to others. Perhaps you'll giggle at my parody poems, or submit a drawing to my art challenge. Do poke around, and do please write me, email- or wiki-wise.

Your homebrew site is delightful. I almost attended a meetup once; I may still. It's a {[[dream]]} of mine that everyone would have their own site. I am not convinced we can have a functioning democracy without it. I appreciate your sharing what you can. Your site seems to be [[PSM]]ing to me, perhaps to a different [[dok]]. Even the fictional characters and masks that can be worn online probabilistically tell us something about the author. I appreciate that you are in this for the long-haul. Progress is slow, but I'm in it for the long-haul too.

I've gone through your site, and I've picked what stands out to me:

* https://www.maxwelljoslyn.com/notes/2020/02/09/2
** With any luck, you'll pass a 1000 soon. 
* Translations
** Is automation of any use to you on this front? I'd like to understand your process.
** https://www.maxwelljoslyn.com/jiangxi-account
*** Haunting. I consider this post a gift to [[Humanity]]. 
** https://www.maxwelljoslyn.com/notes/2020/02/25/1
*** Have you ever posted your work elsewhere? Maybe I've run into your translations on Reddit?
*** I am very lucky to run across translators. I desperately need the perspective.
* https://www.maxwelljoslyn.com/links
** I'm a [[Link|Link Log]] addict. Gracias. Like books on our shelves, they often tell us an important story about the owner.
* https://www.maxwelljoslyn.com/sithlordchallenge
** My [[daughter|j3d1h]] is drawing up something for the art challenge. We've been thinking about it. You are a [[Dungeons and Dragons]] fan, so I think you might appreciate the character we aim to model: [[Aquina the Shadowmonk]].
* https://www.maxwelljoslyn.com/ideas
** This is my favorite part of your site. Note for a lack of trying, but I rarely understand people. I wish it were more common to just get it out and not worry about the optics of it so much. I enjoy having the opportunity to hyperread through their thoughts and ideas. I hope this places grows so large that you have to atomize and catalog it.
* https://www.maxwelljoslyn.com/books
** I like how cleanly the quotes are organized. 
** That reminds me that I've not being doing any book reading. I've been so flooded by the interwebs. 
** If you ever need any e-books or audiobooks, please do not hesitate to ask me. I'll do my best to acquire them for you.
* https://www.maxwelljoslyn.com/poems/bunghole
** I'm completely unqualified to write or interpret [[poetry]]. I adore that you make it. It's an art beyond me.
** I adore this poem. Bunghole is a tremendous concept for me. It reminds me of [[Smelting Muh Silly Farts: ð“‚º]].
* https://www.maxwelljoslyn.com/notes/2020/02/03/1
** There will come a day when you will have the opportunity to meet my [[Root User]]: [[chameleon]]. I think you'll find her RPG and programming work thought-provoking. 
* https://www.maxwelljoslyn.com/notes/2019/11/22/1
** I find that my person-tagging fails to do the work I need it to do. I have too many different reasons to tag a person, and it's simply too ambiguous. I don't have a method I like for fixing this yet. One of my concerns is that I don't want to have to make too many tags. There might not be another way around it though. I may end up using fields here. 
* https://www.maxwelljoslyn.com/inform
** This reminds me of my son. 
** I'd be tempted to write a tool that would translate from your preferred syntax to theirs. 

Thank you for reaching out. I hope I'll be able to hear back from you on your site. This may be a lot to ask, but if you have the chance, I'd like to be able to search, have a tag, or a specific page I could check.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
