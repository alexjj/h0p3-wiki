title: 2020.11.22 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Hilltops

* Vapelyfe
* Read+Write+[//Becoming Nobody//]
* My wife is awake; I can feel her on [[monster-16]]. 
** I want to see them fuck so badly. 
** Went to chill with her (she giggles cause I knew and she knows I'm worried about her sleep). She talked to me about //Star Trek: Discovery// in bliss. I'm glad to see her up late. 
*** In fact, everyone was up at 2am. This is what my house is going to be one day maybe. Hikis hikik√Øing-out together. 
**** I have no fucking clue what we're going to do with that much space. //The Asylum// is the largest residence we've ever had, by miles. I am worried that it will detract from [[intimacy]], but it could just as well be a boon too. Hilltops. I'll go with the flow.
* //Venture Bros// until I drift off at 6?
* Woke at 2
* [[Morning Routine]]
* [[JRE]] called, missed it, called back.
** He called 3 people after, nobody picked up, but there was another callback.
** Asked about whether or not we are going to be moving asap. 
*** Continue to be handed my sign. Distance it is. Not up to me.
*** Asked about [[AIR]] moving in and rent.
** Brought up election fraud. He doesn't want to dismiss the claims. I walk through the definition of fraud here, and make my forest for the trees and software debugging priority arguments. 
** He's not feeling anxious, but she is. She wants to quit, even without anything else lined up. 
** Quinn is growing on him. 
** No visitation because of CV19 and the transition house for biomom.
** He's bored. YT & Plebbit have lost their luster, no gaming, child screaming whenever he's on the machine, but he's doing alright.
** MFW NO GF recommendation
** Can't take his mind off fraud, so we circle back. I agree there may be something for us to learn here.
* Read+Write+Walk+Talk
* [[Family Time]] @ 4
* //The Walk// + 1-on-1s
** Was dark before we got back, long route.
** It becomes even more critical when we don't have their wikis. They can see it, ofc. They have for years.
** My son is enjoying this style. 
* Reading The Wikis
** Nothing to read on the offspring's.
** My wife is disciplined in reading her [[Yearly Cross-section]], and she's clearly more inspired this year. I adore her reasons, and I hope my offspring will listen.
** Asynchronous, and requires more explicit referencing. 
* The Meal
** Roast, veggies, potatoes, mustard, coffee
** [[MTG]], son plays Affinity vs +1 MUC, and I get stuck on 4 land and he plays around my permission well. Pwned.
* Vapelyfe
* [[Family Log]]
** More wandering than usual, discussions late into the night. 
** So awesome not to be in a rush.
