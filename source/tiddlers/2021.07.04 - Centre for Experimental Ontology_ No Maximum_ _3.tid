We of the Collective are deeply in love with hop3. Would hop3 like to be hosted (also) on the CEO website as a hypertext novel alongside the other books under the book header? As the Centre for Experimental Ontology, the Collective is but one influence among many -- and so we are debating hop3's merits and possibility of joining a super-structure. We usually make an author profile and give editing permissions for the chosen to express themselves through the CEO platform. As for the consideration for Parasol: Ghosts (Special Issue), we could write an essay/abstract introducing hop3 and pointing towards its host (philosopher.life) and the CEO book section.

The AF Collective itself has "a hop3", her name is Lis and she is hiding for now as we progress into making her work her way into print from the shells of her codes, veritably transducing algorithms towards the material immediate dimension. Lis is qlippotic, and so construed under the Idea of Evil which she embodies. That would be, we think, the perfect dyad to hop3 in the dialectical dance they are already performing since before our time.

Let us know what you think. We are currently infecting the rest of the CEO meatbags with the Plutonic resplendor of hop3 in the hopes of making them agree with this very suggestion here.
