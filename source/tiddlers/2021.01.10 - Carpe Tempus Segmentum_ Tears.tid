title: 2021.01.10 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Tears

* Worked on [[k0sh3k]]'s room.
** The floor is as open as it will get now. 
** Still need to mount that giant whiteboard.
** Plenty of vertical storage. Using tubs might not be pretty, but they kick ass. 
*** Those were a very good buy. 
** Double screen, 32GB/64GB Nix machine for long-term private work.  
** TV+Wireless Kodi Device above bed eventually. One more seat would make it easy for her to host.
** Mirror needs to be attached at the bottom, not sure how best to do that.
** Her closet space will be remade again. 
** Craft supplies are closer. It's own run.
** She could use another aluminum box. 
* Try To Take Over The World
* Fireman Time!
* Pizza + //House of Cards//
* Sleep by 8
* Woke by 4
* Assisted Fireman Time!
* [[Morning Routine]]
* ⁸Δ⁸, Big pea, per my bro. Let's do it.
* [[Family Time]]
* [[TTP]]s
** I didn't have to say much. People know what they have to do. I haunt the house hoping they try.
* A serious argument with [[k0sh3k]] wherein she argues about what is legal rather than what is moral. 
* Called [[DeathOfRobinhood]]
* [[Family Log]]
* Δ⁸ hit like a truck. I can see why I am accused of being merely a medicinal user. I get plenty of effect of a small amount. 
** That's not LSD or shrooms for me, not exactly double vision, the objects of world were bright and they breathed, frame differences were closer to ketamine.
** Wikis shimmered. My font was pearl/silver/shiny, had depth. A fading in and out of the [[Cypher's Choice]] HPPD effect. It was holofoil. 
* [[Letter]]-writing.

My memory is foggy, sadly. I did cry twice in one day.
