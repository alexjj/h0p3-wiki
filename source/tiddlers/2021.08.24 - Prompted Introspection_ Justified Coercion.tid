title: 2021.08.24 - Prompted Introspection: Justified Coercion

!! Are there any cases in which you would support forced, involuntary brain modification to change someone else's mind, urges, or behavior?

Note that involuntary brain modification likely has a much lower threshold for inclusion than you probably meant to pick out. [[ITS], showing you an image, farting in your vicinity, or calling your name can result in involuntary brain modification. There are defections that must be met with this kind of seeming defection. There are cases of justified coercion, and there are even cases in which radical manipulation is justified. We are rarely humble enough.

I support taking the lives of some persons, including through manipulation, corrupting their mental states, and defeating their moral agency.<<ref "s">> Hitler's the usual go to. If you gave me a button to change his mind or just end his life, I'd press it. Finding exceptions is the easy part. Giving reasons for drawing the boundary lines isn't easy, usually. Obviously, re-education camps have tended to be immorally wielded to be those in [[power]], I have huge problems with how most institutions and individuals engaged in [[memetic warfare]],<<ref "i">> etc. etc. etc., and so on and so forth.

Your question is almost just asking if there is such a thing as [[Justice]].
