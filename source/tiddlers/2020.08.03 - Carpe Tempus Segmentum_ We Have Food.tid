title: 2020.08.03 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: We Have Food

* Woke at 8:30
** My woman's roars woke me. <3.
** Took over an hour, but I fell back asleep.
** My dreams had a narrative. 
* Woke at 1:15
** Chaos dreams
* Spoke with my wife. 
** Standing up to S. 
** Distributing workload of next phase.
** She looks better but still tired AF.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Called [[JRE]] Back
** Hanging out with [[AIR]] for a couple hours yesterday. 
** The grandmother of Matthew has been rejected. 
*** A step forward! He is doing his best not to get his hopes up because he doesn't want to be crushed.
** Interrupted by electricians at his house.
* Dialectures
** Planning spaces and processes
* Shopping @ Aldi
** We decided we were going to slow down. Good. Lots of talking.
** Rockit Apples, dirt cheap. They were the cheapest of everything there. What in the ever living mana?
** Veggies were solid, and we were able to get a lot of bread.
*** My son will be extra happy. 
** Meat was up 60% in price, but they had a hard time keep shelves in stock for it. 
** Still purchasing limits (1x TP per customer). 
** Drinking in the delicious titties around me.
** I picked up two non-food stuffs. 
*** Expandable paper organizers for my offspring. My son will not have his paperwork yet, but my daughter will be handed everything. 
*** Spice shelf. My daughter says she wants the kitchen more organized for space. Good.
** Paul and I got to talk. He's having a hard time remembering names. He looks thinner. 
*** Shot the shit about the world. 
*** He sang a classic songjoke with my wife.
* Dialectures
** Our Papers, Citizenship, One Thing With You While The House Is On Fire, a reiteration (yet again) of things they know cognitively but don't affectively enough.
* [[h0p3ful Review]]
* Read+Write+Walk+Talk
* Fireman Time!
* LoL
