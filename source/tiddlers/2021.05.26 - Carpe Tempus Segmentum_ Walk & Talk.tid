title: 2021.05.26 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Walk & Talk

[[TTTOTW]]. A glimmer of [[ᛝLightᛝ]]. [[TTTOTW]]. Leftovers, LolVod attempt, but this is the third time I just don't care (cool). [[TTTOTW]]. Hung up my door-board! [[TTTOTW]]. 

Went to bed (!= sleep) at 4. Woken by my offspring's half-hour stampede at 9. Couldn't sleep. Daughter has a lot of people contacting her for the vehicle, and she's handling them well. [[TTTOTW]]. Assignments, then back to sleep. Woke late, maybe 2:30? Meditation. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

//The Walk// with my offspring. Spaced Repetition discussion, again, of course. Thinking about [[FO]]L as our analogy. Daughter had nothing, again, as is her political right with me (though, not her moral right). My son had more though, and we thought about the development of our hyperreading habits. There's something embarrassing (and I'm at least partially at fault) about how much more I've learned through informal hyperreading than I have through formal post-secondary education in many respects (though, admittedly, there are topics in which I am sufficiently proficient where I //can't// find a suitable replacement online). It gives me [[hope]], this equalizer. Still, I regret not having taken my hyperreading more seriously from the beginning; I [[hope]] to become the right kind of scholar in the 21st century, [[WINTCIS]]. It's so easy to waste my time (and I still do, e.g. browsing maymays and low-confidence/authority work at the expense of more serious topics and authors). I will always find a way to be shit for brains, no matter the context. Saw Dave, and his dog Lucky; his body language was far more stand-offish. Hrm. Welp, okay. The rest of the walk was pleasant (saw a pool party with some huge titties, yum), and I don't even remember what it was about. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Freenode has been shakier than usual; [[ASmith]] is a fountain of knowledge. Chatted with [[K]]. Been a while! He's doing alright. Jumping back into the grind. Talked a bit about how [[JRE]] is doing. Same city, but they live entirely separate, unrelated lives. I still think it's a shame. Perhaps part of the difference is in virtue of ludologically driven remoting on behalf of my loved ones. Most want to [[vidya]] [[game]]; we are all schizoids. I hear that. In some respects, we've hit the wall. He's solid on the standard pathing he's walking down, and he doesn't need my help there. There's much bigger fish to fry, but I'm not convinced that discussion will ever be on the table. I'm expensive to speak with. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! Oh, they want $650 for two tires (unfortunately, a rare kind, no matter where we look). =/. 

//The Walk// with mi amor, but different. There's a shop within a football field of us that we've never visited. It's quite expensive for being a shithole (<3, but everything up here is so expensive, it's ridiculous), also they had Δ⁸ (also wildly overpriced). I wasn't going to get anything, but there was a minimum, so I got a bag of mixed chip-like snack things and an Arizona Watermelon drank. We walked in the heat, and all I can think about are the beads of sweat running across her like an autist who belongs in horny jail (`/bonk`). Her day was packed, and she's riposting parting shots from Kevin (bless his heart); her gang has her back every step of the way (including K's boss and le dean). Whatever leet ranking they have (apparently, it's quite rare to have it twice, or so they say), she's up for it again (she missed her first well-deserved raise last year). She's making headway on her presentation (most of the people who have positions like hers around the world will have access to it [and, this is the first time it will be remote: quite fitting for this particular tooling] - so, professionally, it's a big deal). She's reading a lot (of pure garbage) again, and she's still getting half-brained sleep (oh, stop fucking taking your allergy medicine: you know you have paradoxical reactions to it :P).  

//Skintime//, cooling off. Basement is far more pleasant to me. Perhaps once the car is gone, we'll rethink how to use the garage space. I think our windows need bright white. Bounce it out. 

My daughter crafted a Bill of Sale by hand that looks like a photocopy of the official form. She was upset about it. We have different standards here. I thought it was dope, and it doesn't need to be pretty. Went to the W-Entity to sell, but obviously they didn't read. Shame. They were nice though, and I appreciate that. So far, my daughter's opinion is that dealing with people is the easy part; it's the logistics that caused her to procrastinate. Sometimes she's quite shy, and then othertimes she's the in-your-face empath I've known since 13 months. This is a worthy task for her.

Made dinner with my offspring. Worked on our accents. We had fun.

[[Family Gathering]] sans [[5c0ut]] (we continue to use the household family Signal channel to great effect). Burgers, and they were good (I cut up an avocado too early, wasted it...I'm not good at this). We didn't talk about much. Mostly shot the shit. +0 clampfinity vs son's Illegal-MUC. Mull, but clamped hard into the game. He played well. I only saw one mistake that required waiting to blow then capsize (and perhaps we could argue about countering disciple as a second possible mistake), and it still probably wouldn't have saved him because I had the ravager combo with a manland, and wiping the board still cost him too much in the end (MoEs and opal in hand to recover if he did). 

[[TTTOTW]]. Local-[[FTO]]. Fireman Time!
