We can use this email thread for communication.

https://philosopher.life/ does not seem have your personal background.
One reason I shared mine, was that similar background helps tailor the communication.

Feel free to send me any questions any time, I'll be happy to provide my thoughts.

Regarding China, you can find various materials that should bring a more complete picture.
The first step is to be comfortable to read the propaganda materials from CCP and the so-called "pro-China" sources.
They generally are showing a different perspective than the western ones.

Behind this suggestion, the key is to gradually recognize the deep root of western value system, and in which parts
they differ from a Chinese one.

The process hopefully can lead to a mental framework that is deeper than the usual democracy vs. authoritarian,
freedom vs. oppression.

If you want some recommendations about the writings, videos etc from non-western sources,
I could provide youtube channels, books, and online articles.

But I usually refrain from that, because it shows a certain embedded personal view.
And I think the most important thing of learning new things is the ability to lower one's mental defense,
but at the same time has the intellectual fortitude to maintain a good independent view.
It's like walking in dark, with an inner sense of direction. It's best if one could start searching by oneself.
