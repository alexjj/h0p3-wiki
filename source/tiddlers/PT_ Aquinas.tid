; 1225-1109: Thomas Aquinas

* Reason and faith are very distinct; we believe in answers that are undecidable by reason.
* All our rational knowledge is acquired through sensory experience.
* A baby's mind is like a blank slate ('tabula rasa') with nothing in it
* The 'essence' of a thing is its description, and it's a separate matter from its existence.
* The world's essence must have preceded its existence, in God's mind.
* God's own essence cannot have preceded his existence; God must be pure existence.
* The universe needs a first mover, a first efficient cause, a necessary being, a perfect being, and an intelligence building natural bodies; those are God.
* The soul is known by its acts/
* True well-being is otherworldly, but we can also achieve an imperfect spiritual well-being on Earth by living a morally good life.
* A judgment is said to be true when it conforms to the external reality.
