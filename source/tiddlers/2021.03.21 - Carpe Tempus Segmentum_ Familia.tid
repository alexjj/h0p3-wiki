title: 2021.03.21 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Familia

[[TTTOTW]]. My wife is up late. Chilled with her, grossed her out, made her giggle. When I hurt myself, she's ultra happy (noice). I tried to put her to sleep talking about computers, but that didn't work. She kept trying to be all clever and shit, so it backfired. =). All the hugs. [[TTTOTW]]<<ref "i">>

Tried another hack with the NRG Tank. Top loading to prime. It hits, huge. Also, Vapyelyfe, *for science. [[TTTOTW]].

```bash
yay -S autokey-qt --noconfirm
# Yeah, doesn't seem prudent to burn mod keys. Was going to write this as an i3 mode, but why? Autokey seems acceptable enough for the job, though it isn't perfect. 
```

Slept late. 

[[Family Time]] @ 5? Late. //The Walk// was blissful. Wish they would tag me in to walk with them more often. It is my plight. It costs too much to speak with me. Have to learn too much of this retard's perspective to make it smooth. [[TTP]]s were not too painful. My wiki had too much to read, possibly; it happens. We were late in writing our summaries, but we were able to get my wife to bed at a reasonable hour. An even I treasured.

Life is best when it's sticky, don't make them not balls (but aim for the balls, yes), don't be like that person, and pet your shoe-impebbling gremlins. 

My daughter asked questions, and she got answers. She is learning never to ask questions. It's impressive. 

Spent time practicing our Choir of Whisperscreams while the real adults went to bed...well, practiced until we couldn't take it seriously anymore. Turns out, we run out of oxygen real fast doing it. An extremely detailed discussion about cocksucking ensued; we have agreed that once a dick has been sucked, it cannot be unsucked. Appreciating tard-chariots and the RPGness of life.
