* j3d1h
** mostly normal, but i've been irritable.
* k0sh3k
**Back has been hurting again, but otherwise fine. Vitamin D was apparently pretty low; thanks, lack of sunlight!
* h0p3
** I've felt good. No bees in my head, though plenty on the screen. Feeling productive toward goals I care about. //Skintime// is dope, food is good, sleep is outstanding, lots of [[TTTOTW]], talked to many people. No Diggity. 
* ASK
** I'm okay. my head hurt a bunch this week, my stomache hurt a bit, I had to spend too much time in the bathroom. my sleep is erratic, sporadic, and of highly variable quality. I feel tired.

!! What was interesting to you last week?

* Tons of [[MTG]]. =D.
* May have a new car! *fingers crossed*
* The death of 3G means I have to get a new phone, dang.
** `/salute`
* I almost hit a kid who ran into the road; I'm glad my brakes still work. I'm overly aware that they aren't in good shape, though, and I'm glad we'll be getting a different car.
* I am worried about [[Q]], though it is only a low chance.
* My purple sword fern is shooting sprouts everywhere! My maidenhand has a single tiny sprout, but it is doing things too! I am loving all the magic! I am getting things done, but as always, I feel I should be further along.

!! Outside of our immediate family, who did we have significant social interactions with? 

* PKM [[Anon]], [[Root Users]], [[Waldo_After_Dark]], [[free2]], [[Silevence]], [[ASmith]], [[papa smurf is real]], [[ALM]], [[gre78er8g]], [[FREEK]], [[psyguy]], [[valmad]], 
* Rach, GK, CA
* Internet randoms on video games.
* I have been doing some strange atypical "I do that too!" bonding with a psychic DJ in the pnw. He is a pretty nice guy. I wish he was local.
* Smokey & Randy, Butter, Q&A, Flippy, Fluffy, Noiz, TwoBit, matoune, Husky

!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family (including ourselves)?

* 1uxb0x
** I think I'm now making submarines that people actually want to use.
*** I'm also trying to connect with more people.
** I respect how you take responsibility for your action and inaction. You're a man of honor, sir.
** Your work on the tools has been thoughtful. I [[hope]] it is a place you might comfortably use for decades to come.
** Thank you for being mindful of your mother's sleep. I know it's exceptionally difficult for autist to remember they are being too loud in some contexts, and you are reflective.
** It has become clearer to me year after year that you are a person with an open heart (and, I do not know how to define that well enough*). Thank you. You're a good man, sir. There is not one person who is not [[lucky]] to know you. 
** You did well speaking with the doctor. I'm glad to see you taking ownership of your health.
** You have been consistently getting your work done and writing it up in your wiki before TableTime; good job!
** i'm glad you are so honest and kind. (orange and green are difficult to find.)
** I enjoyed your hypothetical creation adventure! Talking with you is a lot of fun.
* j3d1h
** i got a whole person asking me for an art commission. :]
** also, i managed to make a genuinely terrifying atmosphere for a roleplay!
** I like hearing you talk stories and discussing character creation with you.
** I'm glad you're taking the opportunity to take a class with St. John's seriously! I think you'll enjoy it!
** I have fun making soup with you. It's pleasant when you run the show, and the product is good. 
** You did an exceptional job, from beginning to end, getting everything set up with the bank. 
** Sometimes, you explain (and argue) with a clarity and concision of an expert. It's a treat for us all.
** It is downright shocking your ability to know what I'm referring to (even picking out the words I cannot) with just a hand motion.
** Thank you for helping me look for my check.
** I greatly appreciate your willingness to explain things.
* k0sh3k
** I've been doing well in Greek, despite feeling behind.
** You've been doing an exceptional job shopping for a vehicle and setting up appointments for the family. Thank you.
** Thank you for pushing me to clean my face, I'm not good about keeping routines like that.
** thanks for helping me work out some more stuff for that sci-fi world!
** Your rendition of Oh Shenandoah last night warmed my heart. I adore your taste in folk.
* h0p3
** The footwarming box I made has been excellent. Cost us nothing more than what we had on hand. I'm glad I listen to the ideas of my family too. They are lookin' out for me.
** You talked to a lot of people this week! You spend a lot of energy helping others become better people, even when it would be easy to just get frustrated with them and ignore them.
*** <3
** Thank you for going with me to look at cars; I appreciate your help in thinking about what we need! (Otherwise, I'd just buy that Chevy monstrosity with two seats and a huge back end.)
*** Chevy to the levy
*** Huge Back End...
**** XD
** Thank you for taking me to the appointments.
** Existing in the same space as you is a joy.
** I love playing magic with you. We have had some epic battles this week.
** Being able to sit next to you while you grind is awesome. You are a pleasure to observe, and skilled enough to enjoy watching for that alone.
** thanks for taking us to the bank to set up accounts.
* ASK
** You have been getting important things done this week. you freaked out a bit about the calling with the phone thing, but once you got going you were fine. 
**  It has been a source of joy to plan our days together!
** Your [[.i3/config]] is lookin' good. Good job.
** Your creativity is amazing. It's not just your work as a chef (e.g. [of the many examples] Stuffed ~~Pepper~~ Cabbage Cassalad), but in so many of your activities, practical and theoretical alike! You are always learning, an the way you explore is something I [[aim]] to learn from. You're skilled.
** Thank you for helping me empathize with Humanity. You are a radical practicioner. I have much to learn from you, and I am [[grateful]] that you are so gentle and patient with me too. 
** Thank you for shopping offline and online with me. You bring both a critical eye and a whimsy too (and I have no idea how to explain that).
*** Balance and Flow, Dear One.
** I know we aren't supposed to repeat ourselves in the [[Family Log]], but your chicken and roasted veggies are that good (we must break the rule; it would be wrong not to). Thank you.
*** to be fair, they were seperate incidences of chicken and roasted veggies.
** You got your phone calls, paperwork, and scheduling ball rolling. It's good.
** Thank you for showing me the fun that is sparring with bofors
** Thank you for asking about coming with us yesterday, and for being understanding when I wanted some time out alone with h0p3. We should do more together, but I appreciate your knowing that I need time with just him, too.
** thanks for helping me think out my villains! i would've been totally unprepared for a cool/scary scene without you. :)
