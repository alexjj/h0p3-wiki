!! About:

This is a log to talk about [[ASCII & Unicode Art]]. It may be inefficient to do it this way. Let's see, eh? I need to develop a workstation that I can clean off, keep messy, etc. It must be compartmentalized. Legacy is not the major issue here (though it often is and sometimes will be). This is just a temporary working space.
