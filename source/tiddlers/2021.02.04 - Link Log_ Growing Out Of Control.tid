* Disconfirm My Bias
** https://www.devever.net/~hl/omi
*** I hate that I will be giving up more and more control of my machine. Even darknet only work is going to have to be done on potatoes.
** https://insights.abnamro.nl/en/2021/02/global-daily-deconstructing-the-surge-in-eurozone-inflation/

* For myself:

*** Sometimes I really, really want to trust. Against my will though, extra-judicial, relying upon the inferences of someone who is very likely my intellectual inferior. If you could see what I can see, you wouldn't be well either.
