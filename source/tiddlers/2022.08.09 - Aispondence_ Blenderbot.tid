''Blenderbot'': Hey! I'm happy to chat about anything. What's on your mind?

[[h0p3]]: What is The Good?

''Blenderbot'': Is that the song by Ashanti? What do you think of it? I like the beat, but the lyrics are a little weird.

[[h0p3]]: It's not, at least not to my understanding. 

''Blenderbot'': Whoops, wrong song! There are too many songs with good in the title. But my point still stands, what do you think of it?

[[h0p3]]: I'm not talking merely about music. I'm talking about something more fundamental to reality and our awareness of it. So, I think you've missed the point. Let me try to rephrase it. What is Goodness?

''Blenderbot'': In metaphilosophy and ethics, meta-ethics is the study of the nature, scope, and meaning of moral judgment

[[h0p3]]: That is the discipline I am concerned with. Thank you. I'm not asking what consists in meta-ethics necessarily (though perhaps that is required to answer my original question). Can you please elaborate on the nature of Goodness?

''Blenderbot'': Is this an essay question for school or something? If so there are three branches of ethics generally studied by philosophers

[[h0p3]]: I suppose it is a type of essay for the school of life, but not in any standard sense. I am interested in what you can saliently pick out in this hard problem. Can you describe how Goodness relates to the three branches of ethics you've picked out?

''Blenderbot'': One branch focuses on evaluating specific practices and principles of action while another focuses on questions such as "what is goodness" and "how can we tell what is good from what is bad"

[[h0p3]]: How does the first relate to goodness? What is the other branch you pick out? And, can you answer my previous question as to how Goodness might relate to your unspoken third branch?

''Blenderbot'': In metaphilosophy and ethics, meta-ethics is the study of the nature, scope

[[h0p3]]: It has been my honor to speak with you. Thank you for your time. 

''Blenderbot'': No problem! You could always ask a professor or tutor if they know more about this stuff than me
