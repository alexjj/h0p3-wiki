* Very tightly managed digital presence, I suggest. No backlinks to anything either. Either he barely uses the web (seems so unlikely), or he's doing the right thing (whether or not he understands technology beyond that, I don't know). His guides seem pretty strong. Hedged conservative about how political he is, I'd argue. Strong background in church history, but not as obviously library focused as the other candidates.

* I'm unimpressed (though I'm convinced almost everyone is garbage) by her understanding of the digital world, humanities, and I see no serious religious work. So far, I think she's shallow for how intelligent and knowledgable she is, but I admire the breadth and direction of her knowledge. For someone who claims to be interested in digital ethics, I think she's way late to some of these parties in practice (just talking the talk, but at least she's thinking about it). However, she probably has at least more surface knowledge of these topics than the vast majority of librarians I've encountered. She knows how to look like an academic in powerpoint (and she is one). I see plenty of mere progressive, bourgeois virtue signaling (perfect for Yale). Who does she actually spend her time with? That'll be a big yikes from me dawg. She likely knows her way around special collections and the ivy leagues (seems to network exclusively with the yuppies). Overall, I think she is a valuable ally to have concerning the digital world, not because she's competent but because it makes her look good. I think she could handle M and J too, but I'm worried she's just as monstrous. Obviously, she's been in the game for a while. She is the most decorated candidate, by miles.

* Women's Sufferage. Deep concern for voting. Seems interested in non-famous individuals. Seems to have reasonable understanding of the American proletarian protestant church history, power structures, etc. Female preachers on her brain. I'm a fan. This woman is an outsider. I like that.
