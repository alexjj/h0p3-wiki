It's my honor to [[meet|Contact]] you, [[nomad]]. Let me know if I can [[help]] you, Madame [[OldestCrone]]. I've read everything you've said on your account, and I'm here to put my skin in the game with you.

I respect my elders as best I can (few merit it at your age, though you seem to be an exception), and I beg you forgive an autistic child for lacking socially acceptable manners. My name is [[h0p3]], o' ancient one. This is not a LARP or an ARG, though this greyish-whitehat does require taming. However immature, prurient, and tedious I may be,<<ref "a">> I'm a real person sitting at his desk thinking about your words. Please choose your words wisely with me, as I [[aim]] to choose mine wisely with you.<<ref "w">> I have come [[to answer you|https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/lobgws/lpt_what_is_the_downside_of_overgiving_sharing/go7h3l0/]], and if you need to speak at length with me (feel free to "ease [me] out of your life"), I would be honored.<<ref "o">> Here is the line that started it:

<<<
Do not tell your secrets. Do not tell anyone, ever, what you most fear, need, or want because you will be giving that person power over you. He can use that knowledge to control you or even to harm you.
<<<

Bullshit. Surely, you don't fucking believe that without exception. I've read your attempt at [[a cynical account|Memetic Warfare]] of [[power]]. You know better. I know you know better, but you go ahead and try to keep that a secret. You imply you are "old enough to not really care what other people think," (people lose conscientousness as they age; it's a convenient form of egoism) but that's clearly not true either (even if it were merely out of selfishness, though I don't suggest you are that).<<ref "so">> I'm sure you've experienced plenty of friction in your life (you work hard to avoid it) to the point you mistakenly claim to live life for yourself (I am prone to hyperbole and gravely mistaken language myself). Surely, you would agree to the maxim: know your limits, givers, because the takers don't have any. You are quick to caution people to //RUN!// (and perhaps that's what you'll do with me). One's life is never complete nor coherent, but [[intimacy]], as you know, is necessary for eudaimonia and requires trusting people (and you are wrong to have claimed that trust cannot be regained, as it can in many cases).

I write what you say I should not to the world. I am glad I do, and I am obligated as well. You already [[share]] yourself with [[others]] to some [[dok]]. I don't know what you are feeling to say what you did, but damn, it's an expensive feeling to have. You let me know if you need help. I'm a person who works hard to listen carefully too.<<ref "v">> Say it however you need to say it.

<<<
Be classy and send an actual letter through snail mail. Forget the gift card. Email shows no effort, and a gift card at this time would be weird.
<<<

Well, for our first encounter, I [[hope]] you'll find I've shown enough effort. You say, "It [is] always better to have such things in writing. Documentation is everything." My god, you have no idea how much I take this to heart. Even a decade from now, I will have our conversation at the ready. I do not wish to have an unjustified selective memory,<<ref "sm">> and I equip myself to punish those who do (and, yes, we are responsible to some [[dok]] for what we remember and the integrity of the stories of our lives).

I too have been "raised"<<ref "m">> by [[narcissists|2019.04.13 - SLT: TOU2]]. You seem to have a very interesting notion of what it means to set people free and a pragmatic preoccupation with self-sufficiency and self-defense. I disagree with your claim that we don't get to tell each [[other]] how to live; I can tell this has been a very expensive place for you. It has been for me too. I am a student of [[good]] and [[evil|E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial]]. It is possible we have made similar [[moral errors|2019.02.14 - L: Goto Jesus, Don't Collect $200.]] in life, from what I can see. I am glad we get to be imperfect with each other. I have no idea how to tell you what your honesty means to me.

* You seem to be a high-functioning Redditor for your age. Why aren't more people in your cohort as literate as you are?
* How was teaching medical coding? What did you teach as a high school teacher? Did you live up to your geometry teacher?
* What were you a road warrior for?
* What is your favorite legit Italian meal? 
* What did you [[like]] most about England? Don't worry, if we are friends, you will be forced to hear me talk about Tolkien (I talk a lot of trash). Aside: [[my wife]] hates that [[song|Music: Library]] too, for very important reasons.
* I adore the way you handled your MIL. She ever get the point of your sentence-finishing exercise? 
* Why do you enjoy /r/AmItheAsshole?
* I have some overlap with you in the Yankee-Southern German-Irish Protestant territory. What do you think about Christianity in the 21st Century?
* Did you anticipate something important about this winter?
* Are you a fan of the way Hank Hill maintains his lawn?

<<<
If you think that I am stupid, get in line beside me.
<<<
Lmao. XD. I hear that. Okay, boomer, shit-sandwich time. I'll start: there's at least an 80% chance a lot of your politics and beliefs about what young people around the world are experiencing (though you often give good advice) are deplorably misguided. Your denial of the possibility of a classless society is something I will hold you accountable for (and, yes, I have a moral right to your answers, ancient one). You're opinions about intellectual property are surprisingly malformed. I desperately hope you're not a landlord (then we'd really need to speak about parasites). I'm pretty worried that your career(s) have blinded you to some crucially morally [[salient]] features of the world. Mine too, right? :P As a colorblind redflag spotter, I too make far too many mistakes. I get the feeling not only did we both have shitty parents, but we've never lived up to our own standards as parents either. God damn, it's hard to be human well. I strongly prefer to attribute this to ignorance rather than malice, but you know what I fear, clearly.

The schizodeluge of the lost desert madman:

You've learned from your mid-life crisis that you yam who you yam,<<ref "y">> and your brand of wisdom shines, no doubt. You pay your debts, deliver the bad news with integrity, spend plenty of time asking people to listen to you asking them to listen to someone you agree with (defer to the authorities, of course :P), you give solid advice (I wish I knew how to thank you), sincerely tell strangers on the interwebs to have a good day (fuck yeah, my ninja), obsess over the corporeality of snailmail (I'm gonna show you how it's done...anyone can keep a copy of this [[‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±]] in its entirety on any of their devices :P), kvetch & lob egg-sucking threats (I do want to hear it, you're a delight), follow the money, slay the slackers and addicts, determine what is and isn't anyone's bidness, nail everything down, ponder our responsibilities (oh, we may have to wrestle), manage your reputation and appearance ruthlessly, ~~tabulate the costs of surviving in capitalism~~ worship business, and attempt to draw the lines of what consists in [[Family|Family Log]] for you and others. 

I'm really glad you let us think about who you are, that you [[share]] yourself ([[whatever parts you can|PSM]]). I think you work hard to trust people with a robustly hedged-conservative (and politically conservative) give and take. I agree that you do a good job of not posting anything that identifies you or your location<<ref "l">> (and I hope you'll take that as a compliment; I hold that process in high regard), and I'll even agree that "confidentiality is a valuable commodity." I like how you'll say things you know are unpopular because you think they are right. I'm not the sort who backs down either. Make no mistake, I prefer to dance rather than brawl. 

Anyway, I'm wandering again, blabbering, it's what I do. I puked up my words on the page, and I think there's food for thought. Maybe we'll have more to say together. My secrets, fears, needs, desires, and vulnerabilities are here. I intend to bind us together. I'm [[lucky]] to be with and even dependent upon people all the way down, and I know it.

Sincerely,

h0p3
