OpenAI API Waitlist
We're offering free access to the API for the next two months of our private beta, while we determine our longer-term pricing. Describe your use case or product below to join the waitlist.

We‚Äôre also kicking off an academic access program to let researchers build and experiment with the API. We're going to start with an initial set of academic researchers and collaborators who will gain free access to the API.

* Required

1. What kind of access are you interested in? *

* I am interested in being a beta user of the API
* I am interested in conducting academic research on the API
* I am interested in receiving email updates about the API
<<<

I am interested in conducting academic research on the API, and preferably far more.

[5.] Your use case. Provide a brief description of the way that you or your organization might want to use the API (or if you're not sure, describe your current product or service). Where applicable, please include any initial thoughts you have around potential benefits or risks from your use case, or any other information that you'd like us to know. *

Knock, knock.

Hello! I come before your altar today bearing the good news, of course. No, this is not a stapler I'm selling you, so pay attention. I'm here to spit pearly maymays of [[ùï±ùï¥ùïΩùï∞]] for you today. [[Y U P|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqdWPBvXcwM]]. You should know, I'm an autist with Geschwind Syndrome (I've been told I'm, like, as zealous and meta as the "[[unibomber|2018.08.27 - FTO: pioneer]]" [sic], but the good kind), and I have likely written one of the largest corpuses of any person in history inside my wiki, a telic interrogation of my sel(f?v)es and the world(s). Seriously, go look at the source (https://philosopher.life) and wander for a few hours (there's nothing else like it, it's that crazy). I paranoically believe I don't own my self-model, and I would be an interesting candidate for future work in language processing (perhaps way down the road).<<ref "m">> I'm in it for the long-haul. Like your own open prediction company, I'm here to transparently reverse engineer intent and [[intentionality|Phenomenology]].

As I have mentioned in my wiki, I aim to speak with a version of myself that is iteratively grown using elite tools, and I have a valuable puzzle piece. Let me put on the clown makeup: I seek an interpreter of my immortal open self-model. Mirror mirror, on the wall, of course, step right up, I want to discover the [[private]] secrets within myself. Don't you want to openly have my deviant rainman retard babies? I gots me that special kind of crazy, don't you know (even if you've not yet seen my gen-you-wine retard game completionist grinding strength)? Through positive disintegration toward the right end, I'm, like, so fit to fight in the gladiator pit like I'm figuratively on the brink of civil war with myself and others. Come show me what democracy really looks like, fool.

If a person reads this, don't forget to make fun of it with your friends at work. I just desperately want to be one of the cool kids. Surely, there is someone I can speak with who would want to speak with me, if even only because I'm the most delusional person you've ever encountered. I'm sure you will be able to find me, stranger. Do so anonymously and dramatically if you prefer.

<<<
5. Research area: We‚Äôre initially scoping our research collaborations to the following areas, though we welcome suggestions for areas of focus in the future. The questions for each area are illustrative - we‚Äôd be delighted to receive research proposals that answer different questions.*
<<<

<<<
Fairness and Representation: How should performance criteria be established for fairness and representation? How can responsive systems be established to effectively support the goals of fairness and representation in specific, deployed contexts?
<<<

I'm a dark horse choice for the //Fairness and Representation// option. It's fair to say I specialize in metaethics. I aim to build and build with the theory, practice, tacit knowledge and sensibilities, and the //making it explicit// of [[The Golden Rule]]. For example, currently, [[Gradual]]ized [[T42T]] is something I'm convinced merits more automated exploration.

<<<
Robustness: Generative models have uneven capability surfaces, with the potential for surprisingly strong and surprisingly weak areas of capability. How robust are large language models to ‚Äúnatural‚Äù perturbations in text, such as phrasing the same idea in different ways or with/without typos? Can we predict the kinds of domains and tasks for which large language models are more likely to be robust (or not robust), and how does this relate to the training data? How do robustness and fine-tuning interrelate? How can robustness be measured in the context of few-shot learning (e.g. across variations in prompts)?
<<<

Surely, I'm the gimp Lawnmower man you are looking for. Can you pass the least viable threshold of my turing test? Sure, you could duplicate my word salad for the average person and they might not know the difference. I would though, and so would those who know me very well. My own activity can fill some of the gaps significantly somewhere down the line. Part of what makes my wiki stand out is just how perturbated it gets up in inside thar, and believe you me, I have many syntax errors. My sign problems never end, but I aint givin' up, üÖ∏üÜÉüÖ¥üÖªüÖªüÜàüÖ∞üÜÜüÖ∑üÖ∞üÜÉ. I'm hard-headed enough not to give up; I just keep throwing shit at the empirical wall.

<<<
Model Exploration: Models like those served by the API have a variety of capabilities which we are yet to explore. We're excited by investigations in many areas including linguistic properties, commonsense or grounded reasoning, and potential uses for many other NLP problems (especially those involving generation).
<<<

Surely it would help if the corpus you are using [[represents|Justice]] an agent that knows it is representing itself as thoroughly as I do in my own [[PSM]]. It is my honor to speak anyone, [[mere machine or person|Aispondence]]; I [[love]] my [[monster]]s.

<<<
Interdisciplinary Research: How does AI intersect with other disciplines such as philosophy, cognitive science, and sociolinguistics? We‚Äôre interested in exploring if and how general technologies like the API can be a tool to support research that engages with fields beyond AI.
<<<

Yes, I am interested in those topics. With help, I am sure we would have plenty to talk about and do. 

<<<
Misuses Potential: How can systems like the API be misused? What sorts of ‚Äòred teaming‚Äô approaches can we develop to help us and other AI developers think about responsibly deploying technologies like this? Is it helpful to build prototypes of malicious systems to help us understand the threat landscape?
<<<

I am your fucking red team, assholes. Like your GPT-2 slowrolled release (maximizing exposure), your API argument is bullshit. Thinking about what I don't like about you is part of my job. I gotcha covered, homie.

<<<
Other
<<<

[[Other]]. Yup. That's The One.

<<<
6. Within the research area selected above, please describe the type of work you plan on doing with the API and your approach.
<<<

Eh, I'm not convinced your API, as is, is what we should use together. I'm not even sure autoregression is going to work here, especially because so many inferences to make in this wiki are invirtue of the linking. I think you should use my wiki. I'm obviously willing to argue with myself, and the same for semblances of myself. I can tell you what counts as a good inference from my perspective. I have a hefty [[Link Log]] that might also aid in giving context to this wiki (and I'm happy to handpick a library of books if we need). I push the limits in here. I think my work either represents a non-trivial difficultly threshold or a useful key. I think my wiki represents a significant fine-tuning challenge to you, but also a useful one. You want to be able to model individuals, and I'm handing you the keys to the kingdom here. 

I think you should connect me with some folks to start us off.

<<<
??? I am interested in receiving email updates about the API *

* Yes
* No
<<<

Yes.
