title: 2022.07.09 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: The Beach

Fireman Time! Chicken + roasted veggies leftovers. Cookies. Water. //Severance//. [[TTTOTW]]. Sleep by 3?

Woke at 8:30? Meditation. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

Folks prepared for the beach. Convinced my sympaticon to come. 

We drove for 35 minutes. Didn't realize it would be this close. Heavy traffic, music, and chatter. State park with good facilities, lots of picnic areas, and it didn't cost anything. A 9/11 tourist trap. New England beach for sure, lots of sailing, some fishing, crabs, you know the look, but with trees on the edges that don't belong there.  

My sympaticon went her own way. The remaining four made camp, applied sunscreen, and then went for a dip. The water was cold, though doable. I'm fat, lack balance, and my feet are no longer calloused. I banged and cut my feet quite a bit. I had to be careful. Lots of living things, no major litter, and it wasn't overcrowded. 

//The Walk// with mi amor. Found lots of shells and rocks. Flipflops spraying water behind us. Hundreds of geese emerged from the dunes, walking their way to the ocean, and the humans made way for them (for the most part). The geese had danced this dance many times, and some were even collared for tracking. No inflatables are allowed in the water. 

//The Walk// with my sympaticon. Talked to a fellow who was fishing. Said it's not catching, more like meditation, but that he catches a couple dozen keepers last week, two today, and others none. A piece of driftwood.

We ate at a fish'n'chips restaurant, and I had clam chowder too. Pretty amazing. Not as good as the place 11 months ago, [[2021.08.07 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Aquarium]], but close. I am convinced they do better fried fish up here than any southern preparation I've encountered. I have no idea why it's better, but it is.

Drive back was pleasant. Assignments. Dadnap. Hard. Woke at 6? My offspring have significant sunburns. Not enough sun protection, but it's not like they've had a lot practice with exposure. We adore our computers.

[[D2]] + //Ender's Shadow// @D7T09:01:15. AHK is not working in D2 for me. No idea why. But, I'd like to ease the burden on the frenzy baba. Constructed Lawbringer, but with Sanctuary's ED bug, I'm not convinced it's a worthy device. The damage is too low on the barb. He doesn't wield Grief as well as the pally. Sorcs and nec grinding. T-Gods. Some eth craftables. 

//Skintime// + //Arrested Development//, //Party Down//, a snippet of //Severance//, and then //Westworld// with my sympaticon.
