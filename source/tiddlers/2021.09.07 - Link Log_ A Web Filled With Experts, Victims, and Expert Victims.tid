*** Analog, lossy, ridiculous word-of-mouth, accidental versions of this exist in Thailand (and everywhere) too. This is what feminists should be fucking fighting against (and those who I respect the most already do). This exists in probably all 1st world nations. This isn't merely some hatepiece against the ay-rabs. This is all around you (though it's not easy to do anything about it, I realize). I'm met enough slaves in my life to know what I'm fighting for. Call me crazy, and I'll know what you are. This is what we are up against. Slavery comes in many [[dok]], and we owe these people our lives. I'd also like to shoutout to Margaret Atwood who has, unfortunately, foreseen too much.
