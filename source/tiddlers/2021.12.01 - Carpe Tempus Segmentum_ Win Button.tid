title: 2021.12.01 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Win Button

//Skintime// + //China, IL// with [[ASK]]. Sleep by 3?

Woke at 11? Meditation. Fireman Time! //Skintime// with [[ASK]]. [[TTTOTW]]. Hugs'n'bugs. [[Morning Routine]].

Shopping @ Aldi with [[ASK]] and [[5c0ut]]. Hit the win-button today, shopping was fun, privileged, and filled with good food. We got more fresh stuff than usual. We have little room in our freezers at this point. 

Shopping @ Our Asian Market with [[ASK]] and [[5c0ut]]. I got some of them sala bow and prawn chips. They got a massive supply of seasoning, sauces, noodles, etc. We got lemongrass and kimchi too.

[[TTTOTW]]. Game 4 of Chess Championship. 

Shopping @ W-Entity with mi amor for candies for advent. It was a pleasant blur. She said I smell like cum, but I've not been cumming much (pre-cumming, yeah). Enjoy, madame. =D.

Dadnap, waiting for her. She came quite late, =(, so minimal //Skintime//, but just enough to hear about her day. 

[[Family Gathering]] was good. [[ASK]] prepared a noodle-based stirfry dish. She wants a real wok or something along those lines (don't remember what happened to our old one), so we'll get one. We watched the Judas episode of //House//. My offspring's ability to recognize Biblical references is sad. I'm sure they will pick up enough along the way. 

[[TTTOTW]]. A long chat with [[ASmith]]. Not convinced he can help me here, which is fine. The man has a lot on his plate. Extended into the evening, more personal than usual. Decided to speak with liquidsnake (whom I've watched quietly for long time).

[[ASK]] is discovering how much more she dislikes some of the software in her life. It's cute watching her cuss at her [[monster]]. Mi amor and my daughter were both up, and both provided me a similar story, XD. Nobody wants to turn their brains off. I get it. I do.
