title: 2020.08.20 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Stainless Steel

* Woke at 2
** Delicious sleep, and, I didn't shit the bed (give it time).
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Offspring weren't even close to on task.
** Son's DNSMasq worked, and my daughter's didn't. She's really going to make me take root.
*** If she weren't lazy, she'd be building work arounds right now.
**** I'd make an oh-shit key, close out junk and fix the whitelister. I'd have a tripwire for my dad SSHing or VNCing in, and I'd tunnel my traffic. Or virtualize. Or even a full-blown rootkit. I'd make it so it didn't matter if I lost root. Nope. She prefers to lie without style or honor.
* Fireman Time!
* Thumb is big, but the rest of my hand is better looking.
** Feels acceptable. Those are the biggest blisters though. If it wouldn't hurt, I want to chew on my skin. =).
* Admired my wife's scars.
** She has more than anyone I've met (or right up there).
** I am a pansy by comparison. 
* Car is charging. 
** No fun arguing with me.
* Cleaning
** Also, we had ants.
* My wife created stainless steel cicadas for me. Amazing. So heavy, and even slicker! We held off on the walk to make and test them.
* Vapelyfe
* The Walk
** The Sensor in me Senses the Sensor in you.
** Cool that a few recognize us. 
** Saw what we believe is a golden eagle. It watched us watching it.
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Offspring made grilled cheese, tomato soup, and peas
* //American Gods//
** Much better the second time around...hrm.
* Read+Write
* LoL
* Fireman Time!
* Read+Write
* Son was got playing games at 2. Now I don't believe him about last night.
* Sleep by 2:30?
