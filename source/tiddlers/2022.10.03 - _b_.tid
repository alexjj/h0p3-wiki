People have got to stop conflating the creation of the modern stock market (shares being an older and independently discovered construction many times in the history of our species) with capitalism (itself an ancient practice of exploitation). Further, arguing these are both new, not merely in terms of realized complexity, is a redflag.

It appears the LLC is a shell-shield often wielded by those who would not wield the [[ROG]] wisely either. Prima facie, stockholders ought be liable for the debts and crimes of the corporation. Given this shield, it remains unclear that otherwise moral competitors stand a chance in the asymmetrical dog-eat-dog pyramid that is evil by top-down design. Given survivorship [[bias]], laziness, and how liability is interpreted in capitalism, many are easily misled to believe scapegoating through incorporation is the only sustainable approach.

Why should we think the wealthy seeking information will subsidize even semi-public prediction markets to the point that the average return reaches the average return on stocks? Only polls that provide useful signal for their [[private]] processes without too effectively aiding their competitors would be something they'd pay for, and only if it was profitable to them. Fiat and incumbent insiders are often the biggest, if not exclusive, winners in the long-run. I do, however, think it is cute-clever to find the indifference point by betting against things that you want to happen to hedge your own happiness. Let's all join in on our personal derivatives markets. That'll surely make it all better.
