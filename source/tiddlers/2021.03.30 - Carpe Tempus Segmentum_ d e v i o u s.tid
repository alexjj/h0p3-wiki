[[Sphygmus]] chatted with me. I'm very lucky to have both asynchronous and synchronous comms with people. The right balancing over time is hard to strike sometimes, [[sharing]] a space with the other. I'm a really messy person, and I don't know enough. It's a great mixture. I'm glad.

```bash
xset r rate 250 150
# Hrm, perhaps a VNC problem. Gonna be lazy AF about it. =)

yay -S micro-git --noconfirm
# It's delightful. 
```

m16-vm-ubuntu is alive now. Shreddit no good there either. By hand it is. Fuck it. Remember kids: overwrite with gibberish before deletion (may still catch them with their pants down, better than nuffin).

Slept. Sweet, baby jesus. Thank you. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

Hugs'n'bugs. Totally hands-off their school, both parents (sounds like they aren't sleeping enough either). Their choice. `/deep-breath`. God damn, I love you. 

The worst best choice of the day: walk or bang. Killing me. I'm a blackhole. I want //everything//. Literally Inform the Men! No time for talking today. My neck and my lips are my buttons. Shut me the fuck right up, yes ma'am. Shower of the gods! Then, I got to hear about her day. It's absurd how much chaos she must bring order to. There's too much to remember. I have no idea how she does it. The amount of warfare that goes into even basic interactions is too much for me. 

Practiced muh julienne cut technique on the ginger, which I confused with the garlic for a moment (I was wondering why we needed more). They are different, btw. Happy to eat both raw/pickled though.<<ref "a">> Chilled with muh bro.

We were going to play with our draft cards, but nobody was too interested. Okay, whatever. Not here for the game anyway. She held my hand (it was a good day). My offspring convinced me to try Fluxx again. The way to win that game is find the quickest possible way to end it, full stop. My daughter lasted longer than the rest of us; she aint no quitter. She won because we couldn't hack our way into ending it faster. This is the worst ever printed. I am literally, physically threatening the creator/discoverer (and all the manufacturers and retailers) of this game. Innovation my ass, Andy Looney, I hate your stupid face (but thank you for giving me any reason to be at the table with my chillun, okay, maybe a beer instead of a punch). I have learned my lesson from the pointlessness of Fluxx and brought it to the next. :P.

Vapelyfe with broski while people loaded up plates. [[Family Gathering]] was filled with induced laughter and new cowpot recipe, which was really nice (I doubt it will last long). [[TLDR]]: We played CAH, and because my daughter is //always// cheating at this game, I decided to see who would notice if I did (someone played with 20 cards in his hand instead).<<ref "p">> My daughter looked me in the eyes and said, "You're cheating, I know it. You don't deserve that giant stack of wins you have." In my flat, serious affect, in at least partial agreement, I raised my 20-card hand and said, "you're right, I am cheating. I really don't deserve these." She was so close! Go on and trust your gut, kid. You got it. I almost said nothing, was going to //Hotstreaks//:[[Sinister Nescience]] this one, see how many times it would take, but my wife actually came really close to beating me while playing fair. I had to let her know because that's impressive. Also, it's amazing how little my wife needs to hear to know I know what card she has in her hand. I think my favorite part of this game is just flashing cards to tell sidequest stories, counterfactual fictions, revelatory goofing. 

Broski and I sat in our armchairs and talked about the Fed. -=[ Rabbitholed ]=- 

Going to be picking up more canned goods. Back to two pantries. My brother has this trick where he can glance at his kitchen and see it all at once when it is ordered fittingly.

Local-[[FTO]], Shah. Might be going on a walk with some loser who takes care of their grandma. Weirdo. I'm asking them to pick out where to walk (they should pick as public a place as they wish). Depressed, memory failing more than average, tiny windows of conversation, mere threads hanging-on. My bet is they haven't actually looked at the ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî± for more than 10 seconds. The conversation killer. It does do its job of slashing through the masses when it must. Shah may care though. Lots of reasons to think they are the sort who does give a fuck; it's just really hard to do.
