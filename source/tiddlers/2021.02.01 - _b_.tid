Put on your pants and organize, gnostic ninjas. Pull me out of the messianic-delusions-rideshare of factionalized group action and strand me out in the middle of nowhere with a jerry can full of theory and a match. It feels like there is only schizoposting in a world where the self is divided. My obscure narcissistic references are often merely internal self-reflections in a ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱. There is a meaning where you must get the whole picture before you get any of the picture. I'm lost. Surprise!

My wife is non-jokingly telling me to lose myself in something.
