> Previously, I mentioned that I didn't like change, and that it was the basis for why I might be considered conservative. 

[[Change]] and price-efficiently finding the fitting rules to accurately perceive and interact with the world can be quite expensive for we [[autists|2022.09.01 - Troglodyte: Autism]], bro. `/nod`. We aren't usually great at modeling the minds of [[others]], but this isn't always detrimental. Knowing our shortcomings sometimes gives us a [[chance]] to step back and think about why people are the way they are, perhaps even providing some basic resistance to unreflectively going with the crowd without some initial critical examination. 

I'm still learnin' about this topic, too, as you know.

There's still plenty to speculate about what consists in conservatism. You will note, of course, that how we define such a word is the result of our own [[bias]]es. Keep that in mind when thinking about my definition of this word, please.

One can be "conservative" (or "hedged-conservative," as I like to say) in the sense of risk-aversion about some aspects of our lives that are not so directly political without perhaps being fittingly labeled something like a [[pright]]ist (my own disambiguating [[word|Alias]] for it*). What's worth //conserving//, saving, keeping, and protecting, and why? No doubt, this a fundamental question for [[finite]] creatures like us.

I suggest the core ethos or motivation of conservatism as a political perspective is egoism and the largely unmitigated pursuit of the self<<ref "s">> or extending one's essence into the world, including via the extension of one's identity through one's tribe(s).<<ref "i">> Though, by this definition, many of the people I've met who would label themselves progressive, liberal, [[pleft]]ist, and so on (and would like to think of themselves as somehow being superior to whatever is considered politically conservative in their society), are actually conservative in practice. It's just not popular in some circles to come out and directly say they only really care about themselves in the end (which confusingly includes appearances of being nice to others, where they are still ultimately motivated by self-interest). Someone who only chooses to vote for policies or politicians because it personally benefits themselves (including their self-perception, tribe, or mere virtue signaling to others), rather than seeking [[the good|The Good]] of all persons, is the type of conservative we should be worried about.

> However, after much discussion, it has come to light that a lot of those Google Slide descriptions were based rather flimsily, and that conservatives aren't quite as positive, or even neutral, as I had thought. This revelation allows me to make much more sense of why I received a score of -64, which is pretty left-sided when considering that I answered with 'no opinion' to anything that I didn't understand...I'm sure that if I did properly comprehend more of the boxes, it would be even further into the negatives. 

What things do you feel you didn't understand?<<ref "k">> Do you really have no opinion on them, or do you think the questionnaire wasn't designed to elicit or provide the option to express your perhaps more complex beliefs and desires about the matter? Do you think there a negative connotation being implied in receiving a "negative" score for holding [[pleft]]ist views?

> This score aligns much more closely with the radical thoughts that I had during the final paragraph of my essay, instead of the flimsy conservative description. After all, I would rather help than hurt, and most conservatives appear to hurt more than they help (and that's bad!).

> So I suppose that it could be considered surprising, but I was more surprised by the incorrect slides than I was by the essay.

What do you think these slides tell you about your teacher, your school, your community, and perhaps even your parents? Do you think this essay you've written ''to'' your teacher (and not merely ''for'') required you to fight an uphill battle against your teacher's [[bias]]?

> What am I most passionate about? Well, it would appear that, on average, my strongest opinions relate to the boxes involving specific types of people, which is a stunning amount of boxes. Let's take box number one for example. It states "The USA should pass a Constitutional amendment that would make it illegal to discriminate in any situation solely on the basis of sex," which to me has an extremely obvious answer, being 'of course they should!' 

I appreciate that you have this intuition. Do you have an argument for why it should be the case? Surely, you're looking to provide a justification with more objective force to it than your own subjective thoughts on the matter. You would probably deny your opponents' intuitions serve as proper justification, right?

> As proof that it's obvious, the literal Oxford definition of discrimination is that it's unjust.

Would it count as proof if the Oxford dictionary defined it as not being discriminatory? Is that really a good argument in favor of your position? Sometimes the definitions handed to us from those in privileged positions are not to be trusted.

> Discriminating is therefore morally wrong, so it of course should be disallowed. 

Can you think of any actions that are morally wrong that should still be politically permissible? I would agree that The Moral Law must fundamentally shape all political laws and social conventions (there are other words we can use here), but I am not convinced we can map true moral normativity 1-to-1 onto the laws of standard governments. That's a hard problem in political philosophy.

> A man being treated poorly just because he is a man, or a woman because she is, has a fundamental flaw, being that their gender does not define their actions and personality, even if it may influence it. An employer saying "we aren't going to hire you as a teacher because you're a man" is a ludicrous statement, right? And that's why I'm so passionate about it. 

I'm curious to see what you think consists in gender. It's a hard problem. 

Do you think we can be morally obligated to stop being ourselves, to change aspects of our personalities, or to even set aside our presentation to others in the pursuit of high priorities?

I know you're working to become a teacher. Have you looked into what male teachers experience? It's an expensive place for an autist employing your line of reasoning.

> It doesn't matter who they are, it matters what they do.

Isn't what they do central to who they really are? Does it also matter "why" they do what they do?

> What about least passionate? I have a lot of things that I'm not passionate about, so it's tricky to decide. Like I mentioned before, if a box was unclear, I labeled it 'no opinion.' There were so many things in that inventory that had no explanation, and it just assumed that I knew, such as number thirty seven. This box mentions "Most adults on welfare are lazy and do not want to work." Welfare? No idea what that is. The lack of clarity means that I am unable to answer it, and I end up offering no opinion at all.

It's time to read, sir. Politics must be a passion for all citizens.

> I had a similar issue with number twenty nine, "The ACLU and similar groups that take many cases to court claiming constitutional rights have been violated usually cause more problems than they solve." I don't know what that means! 

A surprising percentage of Americans don't. What do you think about that?

> There were also some statements that I did understand, but wasn't sure whether they were good or bad, as in number fourteen, "Student lockers should be searched on a random basis for illegal materials by police and/or school officials." Is that really a problem? That just seems like a waste of time, unless illegal locker storing is more common than I think (very uncommon).

Can you think of other reasons police officers (or even school administrators) would ever favor this process? Can you think of any victims that might tend to arise from such a policy?

> Pretty much all of my political beliefs come from a single source. That might sound bad by itself, and I should probably do some extra research on my own, but a single source doesn't mean that it's a bad one. Most of my information on politics, be it news, beliefs, or experiences, comes from my friend [[j3d1h]]. [[j3d1h]] is a kind-hearted, analytical individual who wants to help improve society. They're the person who taught me that communism is not only good, but that it's way better than capitalism, and that past incarnations of communism in societies have just been 'capitalism with extra steps.' Now, this is a pretty crazy thing for a single person to teach someone else, because you would probably expect a lot of denial from such a fundamental deconstruction (I sure would), but the thing about it is that [[j3d1h]] presents their reasons very logically, explaining precisely why communism is better than capitalism. They try to use the inherent objectiveness of morality to get their points across, and it works wonders on me, since it makes the final opinion much easier to digest, being that communism is morally good and capitalism morally bad.

I hope you will find more sources. She's a good one for her age, of course. There's lots of [[wrestling]] to do.

> [[j3d1h]] was also the same person who went over those Google Slides with me and explained that most of the political spectrum descriptions were flimsy or lacking. 

I'd like to hear your view on them. If you have the time, walk me through it. It's a difficult task, and I suggest one's opinions and framing require updating with new information. I think it's also hard to find trustworthy information, especially when most people have a conflict of interest in their discussion of [[justice]]. How do you think we should deal with [[bias]]?

> We figured out that, while radicals are morally the best group, the slides depicted the center as an ideal place to be! 

Some radicals are clearly immoral. Wouldn't you say Hitler was radical, but not in a [[good]] way? I take radicalism to be similar to extremism. I'll agree that some form of extremism<<ref "t">> is morally right in many cases (particularly in justified politics), but the vast majority of extremes tend to be morally vicious. 

Why do you think the slides depicted the center as an ideal, enlightened, or properly moderate position?

> We even took notice of the fact that reactionaries had a specific bullet point dedicated to referring to them positively, when the image shown was literally Hitler. There were a lot of strange things in those slides that I suggest you correct, and [[j3d1h]] and I are trying to figure out how the slides ended up like that. Was it because the descriptions were more opinionated than you thought? Was it because you were trying to be inclusive of all beliefs? Was it because the school disallows leaning towards one side, or parents would get upset? We've been theorizing the reason, and scenarios like these are what I was referring to previously: that [[j3d1h]] is very logical and that they've taught me most of what I know about politics. Maybe you even learned something too while reading, but if not, I still hope that you enjoyed it, and were able to get to know more about me. In conclusion, and in contrast to my original essay, I am most definitely not conservative.

=D.
