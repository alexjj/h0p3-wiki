title: 2020.06.19 - GClark: Rule-Following Problem Rule

"""
[2:04 PM] h0p3: How's it going, sir?
[4:37 PM] qwerkyscience: Decently! Kind of mixed but I am working on a project, building an experiment for cognitive atomization. It’s crazy, so much literature suggests that dissociative drugs don’t disconnect you from your long term memory but I think the doses used are possibly low. I suspect there’s a gradation of effects where different kinds of long term information is cut off. So I suspect visual information might more quickly diminish. 

Besides this, my Facebook chat kind of crashed and a lot of friends kind of disappeared a bit. Not fully, I talk to most of the people still but that was kind of lame as the chat was pretty integrated to my life lol. Someone from the discord who I was talking with often also left. It’s pretty strange. 

I think all these changes have led to some procrastination and mild cynicism for a while. But I’m not too bad regardless. 

I think the riots maybe stimulated these changes.
[4:39 PM] qwerkyscience: How are you?
[4:41 PM] h0p3: Still thinking about what you said. I'm a slow reader. I'm doing well though. Grinding along in life, ups-down, doing my work (still pretty manic), overall happy.
[4:42 PM] h0p3: I ever tell you that my wife was burned alive at 13? They found at she was allergic to morphine on the table. They gave her a great deal of ketamine as the only option available.
[4:47 PM] qwerkyscience: Thats incredible and sad
[4:59 PM] h0p3: Her memory is uniquely variant to my eyes. She is my angel; the most beautiful and righteous creature I have ever met. Her wise story is everything to me. It has been my honor to meet so many intelligent humans (you included), and she is a genius unlike any other I've met. She has significant memory problems (and brilliances that are [[awe]]-inspiring to reverse engineer; she speaks my language like an autistic empathizer savant I've never encountered anywhere else in life). Her uncle, a man she lived with during childhood, [[Charlie]], is a math prodigy and an autistic savant shockingly knowledgable in physics. It is clear ketamine had a significant long-term set of effects on my wife's mind, and I would like to understand them better.
[5:03 PM] h0p3: I don't believe in spellcasting magic, sir, but I do believe my wife is miraculously telepathic with me some ridiculous percentage of the time. It's like she's got Bene Gesserit + Second Foundation [[power]]s to me.
[5:05 PM] h0p3: http://k0sh3k.philosopher.life/
[5:09 PM] h0p3: I'm sorry to hear about the FB chat problem. It's hard to find the right chat platform. I am an advocate of TW in this space.
[5:12 PM] h0p3: I am glad to hear that you aren't doing too bad. Procrastination and cynicism are not fun problems; I definitely experience a very cynical mindset in many contexts, and I'm sorry to about the procrastination (I know that feel).
[5:13 PM] h0p3: The Riots have certainly required me to think long and hard, very much shaping how (and providing opportunities to make choices about how) I have to feel and think.
[5:17 PM] h0p3: I take my Platonic dialogues seriously. It is my honor to understand what you feel and believe.
[5:22 PM] h0p3: Even if I can't make it [[right]], [[hope]]fully I can make it [[beautiful]].
[5:23 PM] qwerkyscience: When I dosed dissociatives, it definitely seemed to change me for years. It was scary at first honestly. I think they are more dramatically impactful than psychedelics. Cannabis is also kind of intense if you end up getting the crazy psychotic effects lol.
[5:24 PM] qwerkyscience: I felt almost traumatized by dxm
[5:24 PM] qwerkyscience: I felt like I couldn’t unsee things
[5:24 PM] qwerkyscience: I think psychedelics can be “unseeable” but it’s not the same sort of thing in my experience, at least yet.
[5:25 PM] qwerkyscience: I felt constantly as if social communication was entirely false and delusional after dxm
[5:26 PM] qwerkyscience: I thought that we are just being vague enough that meaning seems to overlap and we believe we have some specific understanding, but in fact no one is on the same page with anything. Instead we try to use a false sense of bridging each other’s perspectives
[5:26 PM] qwerkyscience: I felt this very emotionally when it happened. I would get bursts of existential horror
[5:27 PM] h0p3: That is terrifying. DXM sits waiting, but I've been working to limit strong disassociatives without a strong negative reason that makes the risk worthwhile. -- Also, yes, sir. I have socially named myself only a few times in life, Psykotic, gdoghomes, 4eak, h0p3.
[5:32 PM] h0p3: You speak of Wittgenstein's rule following problem. Think carefully on that path. I am amazed at the number of empiricists I know who take up internalist positions that spiral into egoistic solipsism. Speculative Realism is a hard problem in philosophy, including the problems of [[other]] minds.
[5:45 PM] h0p3: I certainly do not know what it even means to talk to even myself well enough about my own blackboxes.
[7:30 PM] qwerkyscience: The dxm definitely led to a kind of solipsistic state for a while. I do not feel that I resonate as strongly now though. I think communication is maybe achieved on some level, but perhaps humans perspective of the world really doesn’t reflect reality too well. There are better and worse perspectives but perhaps the best perspectives are still pretty fallible.

[12:10 PM] h0p3: I am a fan of the idea of voting.
