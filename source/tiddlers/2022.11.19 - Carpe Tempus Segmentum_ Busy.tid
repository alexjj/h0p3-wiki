title: 2022.11.19 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Busy

Ginger ale and juice, [[TTTOTW]] + //House of the Dragon//. Laundry. Leftovers. Chat with [[ASK]]; lots to think about at the other place.  Chat with [[j3d1h]], and we can both see my memory deteriorating before our eyes. She lost her stylus last afternoon, but found it. It was a quiet panic. She needs that stylus; it has become crucial to how she enjoys using her computer. Chat with [[1uxb0x]]. I helped him cull and shape the functions of his deck. It's gonna be quite a beast; I'm not convinced I can defeat it 60/40 were I piloting both sides. 

The sacrament of conversation with [[search_social]].

[[TTTOTW]]. Second charge of the Smok. Gotdayum! Still have maybe 25% left in the first pod. Can't make huge clouds with it (well, I've never tried high wattage - I keep it at 5-7W and it doesn't hurt my lungs), but it works for those who sip. Chat with [[Ignota]].

Welp, now that I won't be racing on open trackers, and I've an extra Sata3 SSD embedded in the belly of [[the beast|monster-16]], I suppose I'll still make good use of it. Testing to make sure file[[sharing]] tools don't mind the mount in the middle of `public-share` (they shouldn't). It will be nice not to thrash on torrents (which does happen, unfortunately). Have to add the x's, `rsync -acr -xx --delete --force /mnt/m16-new-storage/ /mnt/m16-old-storage`. Torrents aren't long-term, and it would make the two HDDs asymmetrically sized (yuck). This should accelerate deduping as well (though, that too must be checked, otherwise I'll need to exclude).

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

Picked my sympaticon up a day early. It was not a good experience for her. Oh, well, before that, while omw, I encountered a possible angel on the side of the road. Transacted and carded. Tears as he told me that he needed someone to speak with and was glad that I offered that as well. Got back: eventually slept, maybe 9pm?

Woke at 2. Garbage sleep. Meditation. //Skintime// with my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]]. Responding to [[Ignota]]. [[Q]] is officially adopted! My boi is safe.

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. //Inform the Men!// Meditation. 

[[TTTOTW]].

Shopping @ Burlington with mi amor. Encountered Frank and Steve, brothers, possible angels as well, a kid on the way, finding housing and work. Transacted and carded. Both were extremely talkative (I was given 2 bear hugs and 5 fistbumps in 2 minutes), and Frank asked me to be his "counselor" (and Steve showed me his son's report card), as he too needed someone to speak with. My ears are his, though I do not know how useful I will be. `/wave`. Couldn't find the right leggings for mi amor and my daughter. They wanted $45 for the thin overall snow pants, =/. I want a good pair, as the farmers I grew up with had (they gave me hand-me-downs from their own children a couple times). Doesn't look like that is happening. I did find very cheap pants, a shirt that will be acceptable for the soiree (so that I may finally meet SZ in person), and a construction hoody useful for walking (and my offspring took my other two). I picked out two long sweater things for mi amor so that she may also look the part (she look good). No changing room, but we tried them on in the back area where we weren't supposed to be (my response to the worker was awkwardly humorous, and he decided I wasn't worth his time). We also had sammiches. Talked hard.

Played [[MTG]] with [[1uxb0x]] while [[j3d1h]] and [[ASK]] continued building decks (I want to limit how much I help, as they need the practice; once they have something, we'll tune it). I lost a game to my son. Was well on my way until he just Vault/Key combo'd me out on the spot. I played more conservatively the following games, but my ramp is absurd. No real way into the game. Humility and Bribery were garbage against me, and I'm also bad at [[MTG]], as for the 6th time in 2 weeks, I've failed to remember that Kaldra Compleat has haste.

[[JRE]] messaged me back. They are going to leave fostering option open just in case the donor produces more (though they hope she won't). I am surprised. Cool to see they've changed their minds. From [[Rb]], sounds like cupcakes were enjoyed. 

Mi amor confirmed the rumor. For people who heat their house with electricity, it's gonna be insane (oil and natural gas are also rising, but not at the rate of electricity). I know people who will be spending $1.5k (~1500sqft homes) in January just for their electric bill unless they eschew heating beyond what is necessary for their plumbing. Crazy. 

Cleaning. A bit more insulation around the basement window. We've more to do on this front.

Clogged drain, again. [[1uxb0x]] took apart the pipe downstairs and augured out the clumps. I very much like the hair-catcher recommended to me (have two we use on rotation), and it's a good one. It is no match for haphazard use of 5 longhairs. It annoys me when my flashlights are not where they belong (same for scissors). It went quickly, and we were better prepared. Not much of a mess. Didn't need to use the extended wirebrush though, as that gunk was not built up! The bio-powder we use seems to be working. =D. 

Cleaning. An attempt at a brief VC with [[search_social]]. Jitsi was fucking up in fascinating and different ways for several folks. I couldn't hear anyone, but they could hear me. Reverse was the case for another. People are usually surprised by how high-pitched my voice is. Many tell me they imagine a much deeper pitch after reading my words. `/nod`. 

Laundry. Cleaning.
