I don't know how well we see each [[other]], but I know we can improve upon our vision and understanding wisely together.<<ref "w">>

I don't know what to think about or call this place that I now call ⦗ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱: h0p3⦘. It's nothing short of stupid in some ways, and yet, it's my treasured digital home I share.<<ref "s">>

I'm an autist cursed-endowed with Geschwind Syndrome. To my understanding, as a sacrament, I'm a pointy, sticky, bouldering, [[Gradual]]ized [[T42T]], and pathological communophile toward [[The Telos]]. I do my best to map my life with and like FOSS where applicable, [[WINTCIS]]. I have strong misanthropic shapes in me, and I ask you to be wise with and for your [[Humanity]].

I [[hope]] you are willing to speak at length with a [[madman]]. We each take on risk in life trying to connect with people. 

I'm a polarizing territorial person deeply interested in what it means to privately and publically speak with each other through text.

[[IA2DYJ]] by being as moral as I can even in simulations. Even the mere games of the Game of Life are opportunities to improve upon what matters most. Kindly, where you deem it necessary, please kindly slap in the face and tell me: "wake up, we're equal, idiot." I will thankfully think carefully about the words you write down for me.
