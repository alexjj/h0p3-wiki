title: 2021.05.08 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Flying Kick

Slept hard. 10 hours. Officially on the edge of too much. Wake up, idiot.

Fireman Time! Tried watching //The Eric Andre Show//, but it's irrelevant. Can we say hedonic treadmill? Yes, we can, ~~other [[h0p3]]~~ [[Herb Quine]], yes we can. Misclick and I'm watching the show and listening to Lana Del Rey. Just hit me. Tears. Okay. Time to write.

I've noticed I've been less interested in [[Link Log]]s. Hell, even my reading on the web has turned to shit. I feel like I'm ghosting around in life, pop up in place, perform, FLYING KICK! pre-nerf CoS clicky (*only the best monks, ofc), next mob (I broke the camp a few hours ago). Where's my Scryer with dat Hundred blows staff? Lore. Can't loot it anyways. Freebie to whoever is being ~~nice~~ kind to me in the zone. Happy Birthday, punk. I know. It's broke. Is it 10k Scryers for every one staff? 2 minute kill, 14 days straight of playing to maybe get one on average? This is a really good game.

Back to spinning my cube. [[TTTOTW]] or go be present with fam. Choice seems obvious. Go.

Hugs'n'bugs. Offspring were getting on task. Seems like everyone slept in.

My son's MGA deck is no joke. I was wrong. Looks like a pile, but it isn't. Pure Disenchant, Ramp, and Bomb stacking. He's missing lots of cards, but it works. I'm dropping bombs and playing well, but I'm just overwhelmed by his development and key pin-point removal. Surgical use of Rude Awakenings, leaving no openings. Takes 1 and 3 with it. He demolished me, and my deck is sick. GJ.

[[TTTOTW]] & Dancing. It works. =).

//The Walk//, extended route in the rain. She took my candy, wish she took all of it. ^^take my candy, girl.^^ (Tomorrow. Okay. `/charlie-brown`). Dope walk.

Shopping @ W-Entity. Picked up food, blankets. Ridiculously expensive. Delicious though. Couldn't make keys, so we'll try later at Home Depot. 

Called [[JRE]] back. We blathered while he played on his machine. I'm glad. I'm enjoying the blather. He's gotten better at singing. I don't know if he knows that. Showed me his pikler ladder he built for the boys. It's really well done.
