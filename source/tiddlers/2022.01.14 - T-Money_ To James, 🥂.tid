In short. I'm good. How are you doing?
You made a tiktok channel! =)
I'm hanging in there. Grinding away. It's cold AF up here.
Watching all your vidyas.
Doggo is cute.
I get to see more of your place too than I've seen before.
I'm glad the dogs will keep each other company. There's something to be said for having at least two of any type of creature.
Your idea to dress the dog up in a shirt?
I hope you go for the full mullet.
Thanks for checking out my page! Kinda a sad story how I got the pup. But he has been alot of fun. I haven't went back to work yet so I've been playing with tik toc for my puppy. We had shirts and stuff from our other pup. So we just used dog clothes we already had! Lol. Wife's idea but he likes them to be warm.

You are flexible, sir.
Your foot alright?
I can't get my foot up there like that (don't think I could when I was a teenager even).
I think that mullet can go another 6 inches, at least.
God's Mane
I don't know if I told you. But my best friend passed away suddenly December 3rd. He had hurt his back and was off work. He got some respiratory problems but had already had covid last year. He also survived liver failure due to alcohol induced cirrhosis. He died suddenly of a pulmonary embolism. His girlfriend called me on the way to the hospital. I hopped in the truck and started driving the 6 hour drive to get there. I spoke with the ER doctor shortly after he pronounced the death. I started 2021 with the expectation of Burying my mother during chemotherapy. She is doing well and has a new lease on life. I closed out the year with paying for my best friends cremation on a credit card that I don't have the cash to cover right now
Now I have a new lease on life.
And it includes this amazing haircut that we call the Kentucky waterfall
Fuck dude. I'm sorry.
I almost reached out to you to have you proof the obituary I wrote.
That was the one you went to visit last year, right?
(I'm glad your mom is still doing well.)
Yeah man. We have been best friends since middle school. He knew more about me than my wife. I take many stories and lots of knowledge to my grave. I lost a massive piece of me.
He was 37
That is horrific.
Thank the good Lord he did not have any children
Like you and me and many others like us he did not fear death
But you don't get a puppy when you're planning on passing away. LOL
Yes, sir.
So I lost my dog last year had to put him down. And then I got a new puppy in December. Now he's an internet w**** LOL
I'm in a good middle spot man I just thought you deserved to know kind of why I fell off the map for a minute.
You're all good, sir. 2021 was a very expensive year for you too.
You ain't lying. It's expensive not to work and pay bills
I'm glad to see you come out on the other side even intact, let alone with a new lease.
LOL
That too, lol.
I'm build for this world. Sadly.
Built
I had an old college buddy ask me to adult for him at a tire shop.
It's surprising how so many people struggle with basic human interaction and the ability to manipulate others into catering to your needs
I think that makes me kind of a psychopath. But I'm not very good at it LOL
I am going to tell the truth. B****** love this haircut
Lol.
That KY Waterfall is fitting. Looks good. `/nod`. I like that name too.
H suspenders on The Daily bro
A rustic look

I spent $4,500 to get the stud installed for my $500 tooth. And I'm too cheap to spend the last $500 to get it fixed
And yes that is a shirt of Africa that says roots
I think you look cool without.
You aren't suckin' in your belly there, right?
I'm gettin' fatter.
No I've lost weight. I also had hernia surgery the day after Thanksgiving. James passed away a week later. So I spent the second week of my recovery sleeping on a couch in Charlotte
I messed up a couple weekends ago and accidentally bought a small bottle of gin. But otherwise I've been really good and I'll drink it all. And when I got the Gin I was home alone the girls were in Indiana
Really good and not drunk at all*
A slip and part of recovery. I don't count it aganist my almost year of sobriety from alcohol.
You've done extremely well, sir.
Yeah man. You can't make this shit up. Lol.
It was one of those situations then I literally had to show up and parent The Grieving girlfriend and take care of everything needed in order to get my friend's body released from the hospital. In order to get his authorization for cremation notarized by his mother. Lied to the funeral home that his father was deceased just so we can move on without actually getting his body cremated. I had to play a constant role of mediator between his girlfriend and her family and his estranged family in Georgia
Thankfully all of that is behind me and I'm moving forward like he would want me to. I have never lost someone that close to me that suddenly. I literally have videos of us chatting and talkin the day before and the day of
Apology to drop a heavy bomb. I'm in a really good mood not looking for sympathy. Just elaborating on the heaviness of what I carried last month LOL
Yes, sir.
You did right by him and her.
I'm sure it was a special hell.
I hope you'll be able to keep those vidyas so they won't be lost.
If you could use a remote backup, I'm happy to keep an encrypted resilio sync for you.
(that way I can't see inside, but what remains of your treasure won't be lost)
How are the girls doing?
Girls are doing well. Kathy has nearly lost 100 lbs after bariatric surgery. Lots of Lifestyle Changes there and she is dealing with lots of fatigue but is managing and started a gym this year. Samantha is in the throes of hormonal change. And everyday is a motherfuking roller-coaster and all I want to do is shoot people. Including young children in Middle School. Lol
That is amazing.
And, hilarious*
I can't say I understand hormones well enough, but I am convinced they are extremely influential in our house too.
I know them too well. Unfortunately I'm an emotional monster myself.
We all are. lol. XD.
How is your family doing?
Anyone catch covid yet?
Everyone is healthy so far. `/knock-on-wood`.
I assume we will catch covid sometime.
Walmart today seemed understaffed and understocked, and our area isn't even hit that hard.
Image attached to message
Yeah
I'm worries.
Like that.
Worried.
Yes, sir.
Since I have been doing mostly house husband work all year I've been paying close attention to food prices
Aye. Feeling the inflation.
The lack of Supply in certain areas has been apparent. But he legitimate like we are out of f****** chicken. That's just kind of scary
Empty shelves all over the place
I'm praying for mayhem
A nearly bloodshedless, immediate, and sustained transfer of power to the people of the planet in a fitting infrastructure is what I hope for.
Mayhem do seem mo' likely tho
Yeah I'm more like the concentration of power becomes even smaller. The middle guy and the lower guys get come together and Smash down by the oppressive Force. A Revolution begins and Grassroots area of the world. Mass starvation deaths sickness and desperation beyond what we've ever seen.
Perhaps
I'm going to go to hell for all the ppl i kill
I am blind AF
R u.
Yeah
Like for real? Can't see out of your eyes well?
Lol
Well, figurative, symbolic blindness.
Or blind in the the sense you are attached to an unrealistic Utopia that will never come to fruition and I find it annoyingly hopeful
Aye
I suppose it depends on what you mean by unrealistic and utopia.

Puppy distraction. Real time
I find very few people even know what I believe or am attached to.
Puppy is cute AF.
Yes I'll can utilize my intuition to present something to someone that they'll claim for their own. Most people aren't as articulate as you and are I. Therefore they need help formulating their own words
You sir need none of my help. I actually need your help deciphering what the f*** you
Mean
Lol.
Yes please forgive my lazy attempt and categorized into you into something silly. He was not intended to be offensive
It's all good.
F*** you h0p3
lmao =D
I love you too, T-Money

I'm not sure any of this is healthy. Honestly it's serotonin induced Manic. From a manic depressive. Medicated with an s s r i
I'm playing with fire and postponing the Crash and Burn. But honestly I'm okay with that right now.
I'm glad you are holding it together, sir.
Not easy to do.
wont lie. copious amounts of thc
and a new puppy are a great distraction
have you ever wired an entire electrical circuit breaker panel "high on weed"?
hahaha
i have bro.
Fuck no, haha. I did enjoy your vidya on it though.
that was the outside box comming from the pole.
i illegally cut the safety to rewire it
but i have pics of the inside where i upgraded from an old 30 amp to a full 200 amp services box
Way out of my league.
ran a 30 amp circut for a camper and a 220 service for exterior garage.
dude. i have never done it before
im just built for shit shit.
hahahaah
Just built different, bro
yeah you are
lol
:P
i was so proud of my daughter.
she found the moment to use to word bewilderment in a sentence with me.
lol
It's a good word.
like she said out loud. ive been waiting to use this word
then made her remark. lol

best photo of the kentucky waterfall and joe dirt beard
im just lucky to have hair says my wife
so i roll with it.
i think she is a bit jealous of the additional attention i recieve.

Do you think that is an accurate metaphor?
Accurate no. Funny absolutely
It's quite obvious if you attempt to research cases of the flu for the 2020 season. The numbers simply don't exist it is all covid. But you can Google 2019 and 2018 flu cases and get high quality numbers
Many of the measures used to protect us from covid have been effective in handling other kinds of illness.
It's not that I don't trust the CDC specifically. I don't trust any of the bureaucratic nonsense that is funded by the government. Too many adverse incentive Supply to states to inflate the numbers. I understand why it happened the way that it did. Lots of money being tossed around
The virus is real I have no doubt about that. But the origin of the virus. The release of a vaccine so quickly. A worldwide pandemic. Masking the public. Private companies in venues requiring vaccines to enter facilities. I don't know man it's all crazy. I'm just hanging out in my basement
I don't think you do understand.
Probably not
Me neither.
All I know is there is no quality source of news anymore that I feel confident they are reporting outside of their agenda
A hard problem, indeed, sir.
I'll just continue to hang out in my basement
Me too. =D
And send funny memes
I do my best as well
I mean the American people voted Donald Trump as president. Like s*** has went downhill so far I don't know where to begin. We literally voted for the You're Fired Guy
They wanted to watch the world burn.
I would take Barack Obama back right now Kathy
That may be part of the point, to continue to nudge us toward Classic Liberals. He's black Reagan (but non-self-hating).
I'm still praying for Mayhem. I'd like to watch it burn. I mean I do want some fire extinguishers. I personally don't want to burn I just want to watch it
LOL
Obama was not black Reagan.
LOL. Maybe so in the fact that he was such a good orator. I hate that everyone makes fun of Michelle Obama. Me and my wife were just talkin, I think she is a hottie
I hope you will spend some time reconsidering my claim.
You forget I'm not that deep. It's all surface level nonsense.
As Jewel said. Who will save my soul?
That is no excuse.
Plenty intelligent enough to be less wrong.
Forgive me what am I wrong about? Obama being Reagan?
Having plenty in common with him, yes. That is to start.
I'm not invested in agreeing or disagreeing with you on that. You win.
Image attached to message
I hope you will spend some time reconsidering my claim.
Like I sincerely feel we are on the precipice of legitimate Mayhem
Perhaps
And there are plenty who deserve the blame. Obama and Reagan both have their share as well. But Cheeto man and the senile dude we got now. Yeah contributing to the problem
I agree to that claim.
I have been conserving getting some donkeys and muels to train them.
Goat meat is delicious.
Hard to find a way to go fully independent, off-the-grid in a sustainable way.
I don't think an individual family is capable of going fully independent for an extended. Of time. It definitely has to be a community effort and has always been historically in the past
I agree that it is highly unlikely unless you began with far too much capital and planning (and, the ultra-wealthy have been increasingly), but they were already going to survive.
It reminds me of that South Park episode when Cartman injex Kyle with the AIDS virus and then meet up with Magic Johnson. The Cure is injecting straight cash money into your veins
Lol
I would be very curious how the capital and planning of the ultra-wealthy wood protect them from the masses.
A worthy investigation
As power grid shutdown, refineries shut down, and Roads become impassable.
Aye
Your generators has become useless. You can only store gasoline for so long before it goes bad
And you might be able to build big walls. But there are a lot of very ingenuitive rednecks that cover this nation
It is difficult to appreciate how wealthy the wealthiest are.
But when the economy collapses and the dollar carries no value. All you have is existing assets that are physical.
Aye
It would be interesting to study how the most wealthy fared after World War II in Germany
Though, I think physical may be more inclusive than you intend here.
That may be valuable.
Not just Germany either.
The outcomes of wealthy families over thousand years even.
The wealthiest are often less beholden to any particular nation or geographic region.
Sometimes you're really annoying to talk to. I generally don't like talking to people that are smarter than me
You engage me on a higher level than I am used to. Most people's minds don't think as quick or as deep. And you have the audacity to tell me to investigate further
I agree. I am annoyin. Lol.
I'll stab you with an umbrella and then open it. Because I'm sick like a diseased Ethiopian
