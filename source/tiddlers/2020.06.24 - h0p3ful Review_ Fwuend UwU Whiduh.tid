** I adore the matching [[prompt]] and [[Antipleonasm Analysis]] you do. Some of the content that's missing in one can be found in the other. 
** I would like to have seen a rehearsal of a steelmanned expression of the quote. Hand the person their argument in such a way that they at least recognize it as their own, and better yet, as an improved representation. By strengthening what is correct, you can show why the weaknesses fail more dramatically, yet fixably (and in such a way that it's easier to swallow).
*** Look, this is better than I do in my own work. I'm not complaining. I'm trying to pick out how to improve here. Your goal is to be a helluvalot better than I am at this shit (yeah, everything, I guess).

** up. lern 2 play.
*** I adore how you can put two fingers to your temple, squint at me, and "telepathically" I know exactly what you are saying to me. Of course, I love you too. =)
** I like that you are making comics. I hope you won't fret too much about it not looking exactly like you wanted (you know what I'm thinking, so I'll stop here).
** You are monitoring your sleep schedule more thoroughly than you ever have. I'm grateful. It is such a crucial signal in your life. You are much wiser at your age than I was (hell, I still don't have a sane sleep schedule).
*[[2020/06/23 -- Prompted Introspection: Slight Rant]]
** I realize that answering these questions in this spacetime is ridiculous. You do a great job with what you have here.
** Love the rant, of course. I think you've missed part of the first question (or you skipped over it too quickly). This is a hard problem. I ask you to continue to think about it.
*** As we have many times before, this is a topic we will need to speak about many times again (and I'm sure something you will contemplate long after I am gone).
** I like that I have to sit and stare at the screen lost in your thought here. My reading speed does slow down in this kind of analysis mode. It's a slow and close reading.

** up, loser.
** I agree: you need friends who aren't lazy and stupid. Moonstone sounds fascinating.
*** You know me, I'm always on the prowl for 14yo grills interested in politics and saving da pwowetawians.
** It's not that I won't have strong opinions at those levels, but it's not always appropriate for me to push further in that direction (and, yes, I'm saying that seriously even with the line right above this one, lol).
*** It's great when I have the chance to justifiably say it to anyone (which is such a rare occasion for me): you do you.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** [[Code Snippets]] needs a tagging. Gather this shit together, yo.
