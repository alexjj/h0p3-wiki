You both like Programming.
You: Hello!
Stranger: Hi !
You: What brings you here today?
Stranger: I want to have more knowledge
You: Hells yeah.
You: Me too.
You: I suppose I want not just knowledge of anything (there are an infinite number of truths to know), but knowledge of what matters.
You: What do you think matters most? What is worth knowing?
Stranger: Do you have any idea bruh
You: I have guesses, lol.
You: I think trying to understand together the nature of [[The Good]], especially in our context, would qualify.
You: I'm interested in programming tools that serve persons in general.
You: What kinds of tools enable us to share what we understand to be [[salient]] together in a fair, performant, and safe way?
You: We can talk about something else entirely*
Stranger: What salient means, English is not my native language
You: Ah, well, it's not even originally an English word, really. I'm using it to pick out an ancient concept. Salience is concerned with saltiness (not the modern way of talking about anger, but literally about the stuff we add to our food to make it taste delightful).
Stranger: Okay, thank you for explaining
You: We can think of salience as highlighting what is important or value from a sea of flatness.
You: Similar to how salt makes food "stand out" to us.
Stranger: Yeah ,at first are you a programmer
You: I dabble. I've used computers for 30 years.
You: How about you?
Stranger: 😅
Stranger: It's just my first year,at university, software engineering and information systems
You: Hell yeah, my friend!
You: That's [[awe]]some.
You: What do you enjoy most about it so far?
Stranger: Everything lol , especially coding!
You: I adore my [[monster]] (https://philosopher.life/#Monster-%CE%A6). [[Computing]] is a gorgeous and even addictive activity.
You: What classes have you been taking?
Stranger: like 13 for each semester
You: 13 classes?
You: Holy god. That is absurd.
You: How does your schedule work?
Stranger: haha 😥😅
Stranger: schedule?
You: I'm not used to university systems that enable their students to take that many classes. I assume they are shorter units than I'm used to. I'm wondering how many hours per week you spend on a given class.
Stranger: Everything is pretty cool and not really hard
You: Anyway, what have you been coding that makes you feel happy or proud?
Stranger: Many professors
Stranger: I am just a beginner 😅
You: Well, I hate to say it, but I'm probably just a beginner myself.
You: I look up at the people who are way up high on the mountain, climbing much further beyond anything I will ever reach.
You: What computer are you using?
Stranger: My computer just broken 😭, it's Lenovo , windows 7 professional
You: =(.
You: What broke?
Stranger: He stopped to work at the week of my exam lol
You: Ouch.
Stranger: Yes !
Stranger: Anyway
Stranger: What type of PC you advise me to buy
Stranger: But not expensive please 😅😅
You: I don't know where you live, and I know that pricing varies considerably. I'm hard-pressed to advise you.
You: I suggest picking up at least one computer that is highly Linux compatible.
You: I would focus on single-threaded benchmarks, RAM (I'd aim for no less than 16GB), and an SSD (preferably an NVME drive).
Stranger: Okay 👌
You: This is a reasonable place for benchmarks: https://www.cpubenchmark.net/
Stranger: Thank you 😊
You: I don't buy new laptops; I only buy them used. You'll have to think about what your secondary market is like. I live on my desktop though.
Stranger: I have to raise some money to buy,is there any organization that gives PCs for free for software engineering student
You: I do not know that one. I'm sorry. =/.
Stranger: Like in north Africa or Tunisia
Stranger: No problem!
You: What's your internet connection like?
Stranger: it's good these days and in Dorm there's an unlimited internet connection
Stranger: It was expensive before installing wifi
You: How often does it drop off for you (if at all)? What is your up/down speeds, on average?
You: Was it expensive because you had to rely upon your phone's modem?
Stranger: No it's pretty good now!
Stranger: Phone tickets
You: Ah, yeah. That shit is very expensive.
Stranger: Yes !
You: Hey, my name is h0p3. I really enjoy thinking about computers a lot. I want you to be able to communicate with me after we leave Omegle. This is my contact information: https://philosopher.life/#Contact%20h0p3 - I use Tox and Session (https://tox.chat/clients.html and https://getsession.org/) for real-time communications (in case you ever desired to reach out).
Stranger: I have to buy a PC because I am obligated to go from city to city to study that's why I don't prefer desktop
You: A used laptop makes good sense then!
Stranger: Thank you sir 😁
You: It is my honor. Do you have an alias I can call you by?
Stranger: alias ? Like miss ? Or my name?
You: A nickname, a pseudonym.
Stranger: Emy
You: Not your offline name.
You: Emy, cool.
Stranger: yes
Stranger: Are you professional 😃
You: I have been a professional programmer before, but I am not skilled.
You: I simply <3 computing, even if I'm bad at it. XD.
You: I've met many professionals though.
Stranger: Haha ,if you love it that's what matters
You: Ah, we have picked out what is [[salient]] my friend. [[Love]]. https://philosopher.life/#Love
Stranger: are you a philosopher
You: I am. I do my best. I cannot say I am good enough.
Stranger: interesting 😃
Stranger: Are you on LinkedIn
You: I am not. I'm not a fan of this network, though I understand that many must use it to advance their careers.
You: I do my best to avoid most social networks, and instead work to own the means of production. I want to own my machines and my data and even the very processes I use to think about myself and the world.
Stranger: What I suppose to do 😥 then
You: That site I've linked to you is actually a single HTML file, a really big one. You can download it and view it offline safely. It's my version of a social network, or at least, it my node that can live on many networks.
Stranger: Getting a profile on LinkedIn or not
You: You go ahead and get a profile if you think it will help you.
Stranger: Which link
You: https://philosopher.life/
Stranger: Okay 👍
Stranger: Do you think used PC is good for 5 years of studying software engineering and information systems
Stranger: At least
You: It can be. It depends on what parts of engineering you are working on. Some of the best hackers I've ever met live on potatoes (really terrible, awful, slow, no good computers that are still noble machines!).
You: I would anticipate that a decent PC will last for 5 years, yes. Though, laptops suffer from wear and tear considerably.
You: If you are using Linux and you keep it lightweight, you can work magic on even very old machines.
Stranger: I don't use Linux in usual, I am using windows
You: You should consider dual-booting.
Stranger: okay ✍️ lol many information
You: I will keep our conversation available for you so that you may review it.
Stranger: thanks
Stranger: 😁
You: Here's the link where our conversation will end up: http://philosopher.life/#2021.08.12%20-%20Anonymous%3A%20For%20Emy (it's blank right now)
Stranger: Do you know good servers to join on discordon
Stranger: Discord**
You: https://philosopher.life/#Links%3A%20Discord%20Servers has a list of servers I enjoyed before I scrubbed my account and deleted it.
Stranger: Okay ✍️😁
You: I highly suggest picking good subreddits, reading hackernews (news.ycombinator.com), and following particular projects that interest you.
Stranger: Hell yeah
Stranger: Get answers quickly
You: The eternal problem. =)
Stranger: And what after learning java and C and python , what is the next language to learn
You: Those are excellent languages. I think Rust and Go are worthy languages as well.
Stranger: Okay 👌
You: You may spend a lot of time learning the mathematics underlying computer science. Studying data structures and algorithms won't be a waste of your time.
You: There's also a lot of things to study //about// programming that aren't directly concerned with coding itself. Those are some of the more [[salient]] things to study about computers, imho.
You: It's a good thing you are hunting for knowledge; I'm sure you are flooded by it.
Stranger: Yes hunting always 😬😬😬
You: What do you like to do when you aren't in school or working on programming?
Stranger: Is that your question
You: Yes. =) I'm wondering who you are outside of school and computing.
You: (though, obviously, school and computing are badass)
Stranger: I am introvert girl lol
Stranger: No friends
You: I'm sorry to hear that. =/.
Stranger: they are annoying friends
You: What makes them annoying?
Stranger: I don't find some motivated people like me here
You: Oh. What do they prefer to do with their resources?
Stranger: Share knowledge and having fun without being jealous or selfish
Stranger: Even my roommate was horrible
You: That's a high calling, no doubt.
You: What made them horrible?
Stranger: I care about her when she is sick but she never ever cares about me at all
You: I hate to say it, but I think most humans are that way. =(.
Stranger: And she has many friends
Stranger: But she hated me
Stranger: For no reason
Stranger: She is a lazy and spoiled girl
You: I know that feeling.
You: I respect your kindness and thoughtfulness. I know it's not easy to navigate the world alone or deal with selfish people at every turn.
Stranger: My friends want to just take benefits of you without giving anything
Stranger: Yes thank you btw
You: I've found lots of [[friend]]s online. That can [[help]] to some extent. It's still important to have offline friends who care about you. Sometimes I see socializing as being a process in which we sift humans for [[good]] people.
You: Do you have any family?
Stranger: I have a question lol
You: Shoot, ask away.
Stranger: Why you put some words between ()
Stranger: Yes mom and sister
You: Oh, those are [[link]]s in my ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱. You can search those words, and there is page dedicated to them. [[Find The Others]] is the syntax I use inside the wiki to link to that page. https://philosopher.life/#Find%20The%20Others
You: When you go to [[review]] the transcript of our conversation, you'll have the links right there for you.
Stranger: Okay 😬
You: It might not be useful to you, but it may.
Stranger: I know that
You: Do you get to see your mom and sister often?
Stranger: Except vacation
You: Oh. It can be difficult not to be able to see our [[love]]d ones for long stretches of time.
Stranger: Yes it is !
You: Are you able to remotely communicate with them often?
You: (not everyone enjoys communicating remotely, so that can hinder our ability to stay in touch)
Stranger: yes it's the wifi in the dorm
You: Ah, well, good.
Stranger: yeah I hope that everything be good like that next year
Stranger: inshAllah
You: Back when I was in college, there was no wifi available to students. We had to plug our computers into the network with an ethernet cord.
You: for the dorm* that is
You: Insha'Allah, I [[hope]] so too.
Stranger: Are you Muslim
You: I am not. But, I am a religious man.
Stranger: Nice ,i wish if you was Muslim
Stranger: Anyway continue
You: I can appreciate that.
Stranger: Yeah I used internet a lot last year of high School
You: The internet is the best.
You: I wish I could run it straight into my veins.
Stranger: Lol 😆
Stranger: Yes it is, it's not available for all people
You: That is a crime against [[Humanity]]. I am very worried about this problem.
Stranger: Yes , for is for example we couldn't install wifi for years
Stranger: For my family
You: Primarily due to costs, or other reasons?
Stranger: But other people do ,no it's not costs at all , it's like they installed it for people that they know or having another illegal money
Stranger: What that called in English
You: nepotism?
You: Corruption of some kind.
You: There are many words for this problem. It is a serious problem.
Stranger: I think so , we give the same money but they ignore us and do it for our neighbors
You: That makes me angry.
Stranger: Yes ,we suffer a lot
Stranger: Like they don't care about you at all ,go and kill yourself
You: =/, yeah. I know the sort.
Stranger: but we have at my grandma's house
Stranger: Now
You: I think I'd be grandma's house all the time.
You: Tell me about your grandma.
Stranger: She is the one that will buy the PC for me honestly
You: Your grandma is dope.
You: What does she think about computers?
Stranger: And yeah she learned by herself
You: She's [[Leet]].
Stranger: She always tell us how they don't let her study in school
You: Why didn't they?
Technical error: Lost contact with server, and couldn't reach it after 3 tries. Sorry. :( Omegle understands if you hate it now, but Omegle still loves you.
