* > we are ourselves the entities to be analysed
** What could be more [[Straussian]] than that? It's only true on solipsism, internalism, and ultimately anti-realism(s). Heidegger was wrong about a great many things, and if we take up the torch he stole (from Husserl) and transformed seriously, we'll likely be forced to do the same. Here's my heresy.
** We are studying the experience of our experience, at the very least.
** Insofar as we are ends in ourselves in virtue of moral autonomy, an incompatibilist Kantian Reason at the core of our Kantian [[Humanity]] fundamentally concerned with perceiving and being toward metaphysics [[irwartfrr]], yes, we all must examine such as [[others]], an irreducible essential, qualiatic end that ought to wield its own contingency as an emerging and evolving instrument (in reflective equilibrium) toward its collective goodwill and goodfaith attempts to discover-represent the [[The Final Telos|The Good]].
*** > we are it (Dasein), each of us, we ourselves
**** I'm fine with the claim that Heidegger is opposed to this view in some respect. He was simply too immoral to know the truth. He was morally vicious (and we must admit that even Socratic classism held them back too here [though they tried, amiright?]), and that must take that into account at this level. Ad hominem is necessary for fair interpretations and judgments of authority.
** We are not obligated to agree to the onti/ontological distinction, and we should doubt what it means to claim Dasein is the ontological layer preceding the ego.
*** Further, I suggest Heidegger's internalism (as demonstrated among his neo-Virtue_Theorists) shows the hubris of claiming Dasein's ontological priority to ~~theoretical~~ metaphysical objects. Obviously, I'll agree that the concept of Dasein precedes all instantiations or tokens (and that there's something to be said for claiming their unity), but I see no reason to accept that a living Dasein is conceptually different from an individual Person^^tm^^ (though I'll agree it extends beyond the modernist's epistemic prior to ont*c Cartesian or Husserlian apodictically bound ego-cogito [and this here is why I think Heidegger might never have escaped as he wished]). 
*** I'm sympathetic to the conceptual necessity of Dasein lying syntactically prior in existential (not the quantifier, though that is also an interesting question) statements, though I wonder if the bootstrapping into autonomy may demonstate otherwise. It may be a transcendental problem. 
**** ["There is" X] does not necessarily imply Da-Sein (a mind knowing "there is" and "that it is" coming to understand "that it is" and "that there is") unless we are just talking about The Absolute, and that may be the case (I do not know, Socrates). 
*****  A Living Dasein cannot be wrong about its own existence in at least one respect because it is a free cogito, a changing self-thinking thing thinking about it's own thinking, in partaking of Saint Aristotle's Eternal Perfection of the Essence of Metaphysics, his divinity, which is [[Saint Plato]]'s too (cringe all you want).
***** Why should we think the concept of Dasein is aimed at the //sum// of //Cogito ergo sum//? The most fundamental context such that there //be// "I"s and "thinking" in the first place are not categories of instantiated experiencing but of metaphysics. It's a further Hegelian point to claim that metaphysics might be Daseinic. 
****** We are not obligated (nor are we obviously permitted) to assert the claim that "I am" is all that much what we are, though there are fundamental links. It is possible that "I am" is a living idea though not a Dasein or so beyond Dasein it's ineffable. Heidegger is doing fundamental philosophy, I agree. 
****** It may be the case that many non-Daseinic beings can think. And, even thinking that one is an "I" is not obviously equivalent to claiming it is or has or partakes of an "I" or "I-ness" all the way down. P-zombies are hard problems. 
****** Dasein is not obviously sufficient on the PoSR, though it is necessary as a concept for the concept of a moral (and hence existential) [[phenomenology]]. Dasein that doesn't think normatively about it's own existence is bad at thinking about its own existence. It is less-than in such cases. It exists to the same degree, but it's not what is toward its sufficiency. 
******* Descartes starts with metaphysics only in appearance, and never arrives. Setting aside the deism signaling requirements as a [[Straussian]], we can agree that the method of doubt never makes it to escape velocity because probabilistic-infernential empiricism must be part of the equation. We have to begin with a established belief about metaphysics even as priors, that's part of the category of our Reason. 
******** I agree with Heidegger that Descartes misses the boat on questioning how our positions on metaphysics go on to be products of the kinds of beings that we are. 
* > Thinking is not the only way of being of Dasein.
** Not the only, but necessarily as part though. There is no [[phenomenology]] for Dasein without at least the background radiation of continuing the implicit thinking of at the very least being a thinking thing in a world. 
*** So, I agree that every instance of Dasein is thinking and to some [[dok]] carries with it at least an implicit "I", even if it is not exhausted in the kinds explicit recognitions, discoveries, and self-conscious reflections upon of cogitos and egos. So, there is something anti-condificationist to consider here.
** The essence of Dasein includes some underlying pre-conditions and architectures and implications for contingency in the evolution of those architectures. While there are multiple ways of being Dasein and experiencing as Dasein, there is that which is essential to all Dasein. 
** > is to be shown as it is proximally and for the most part — in its average everydayness
*** Perhaps it is preferred, desires, or even empirically likely, or the tendency will be that, however, "the most part" is not obviously necessarily true. The Present-At-Hand might be our fucking vocations in some sense though. Once we move past nihilistic positivism, wisdom requires that humble our assumption here of what it means to be Dasein as Dasein-well.
* > prior to being this or that thing we are firstly just being
** We are experiencing being, we are being as, there is beingness to us, and I agree that anything that obtains has a being, even if only in virtue of the concept of what it means for it to obtain. 
*** Insofar as a Dasein obtains, it shares in common with all objects that obtain, being or "it obtains." It is true given this possible world. The semantics of the actual world are such that it includes all facts of this thing, and whatever extra special metaphysical touches that we might be tempted to say Dasein is prior to in the reification into "I" and "thinking."
*** Metaphysics is not what we construct, though we must construct in order to discover (even humbly in some cases) metaphysics. Heidegger still has it backwards. I think the conceit may simply be having claimed to have overridden a Cartesian perspective without having actually done so. 
* > Heidegger’s diagnosis of traditional philosophy is that it fails to develop an adequate theory of ourselves, because it reifies ourselves qua minded beings: we are considered either as some sort of an entity over and above the physical (dualism, in particular Descartes), or as being nothing but some physical stuff among other physical stuff (reductive physicalism)
** System 2 is key to our present-at-handedness, and we would not be Dasein without something functionally equivalent. A person is a thing, but not a mere thing. You cannot go beneath a person being a thing except insofar as you are simply picking out qualia. Ultimately, our qualia implies dualism, and that's part of what makes us a very different kind of thing from mere objects in a reductive physicalism. Heidegger can dig as deep as he wants, but he cannot capture the peculiarity of Dasein's existence without already committing the crime he claims Descartes has committed. 
*** Heidegger's anti-realism extends into denying the existence of things Dasein isn't thinking about (or at least experiencing) at some level. It never makes it past the Copernican Revolution; it's still fundamentally too solipsistic. He's gotta bite the bullet, and he's too egoistic to do it. 
**** Perhaps he attempts to unify the world and the self as a thing while trying to avoid calling anything a thing. Dasein does not escape the category of thinghood, even if it can have such experience. It can be wrong at some level, though it still begs the question. It must take up some turtles.
