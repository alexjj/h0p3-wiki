Holleee fuck. That was amazing. I am blistered stoned and I have never seen this video or this song done like that. Wow. Like one of my new favorites now! Thank you for sharing!
Did you recently discover that or have you been sitting in that?
On*
Today
Awesome. Yes. It's amazing. Always share music with me!
Hope you are well enough today!
Taking it easy

I am a meme collector. Never enough hawtness in the world.

Thumbs up?
I'm driving in New York City right now
Hahaha. Be safe please!
You back home yet?

Yup
How's your day going?
How are you good sir?
It's been a productive day. We had lentil soup. It was good.
Thinking we should have made more than we did. I like those leftovers a lot.
Haha. That is awesome!
My fridge is full from the camoit Halloween gig this past weekend.
Campout*
Makes life easy to have it all set
My life is so much easier than it ever was suppose to be.
Hahah
Parts of it are significantly easier for us.
Brilliance is a burden not everyone can bare.
Lmao
hehe
I think it's worth thinking about what's worth suffering for, no doubt.
Without it, I'm not convinced life can be all that satisfying either.
Or at least not justifiably so
I had a tough night last night. Not gonna lie.
What made it tough?
I am thankful my brain has began to overtake thr Ssri I threw at it back in the spring when momma first got sick.
Basically I was depressed af and thankful for it?
Such is life.
When a so common feeling is absent for many months....
I got lost
There may be some types of depression for which it is rational to be thankful.
"I miss the comfort in being sad" - Cobain put it simply.
That is another claim.
Either way. I threw chemicals at a problem. Knowing it was a risk.
Still damaged goods. Always will be. But thc in high quantities is near psychedelic.
How are the girls doing?
Self sufficient
Lol
An odd place to be as a dad, I think.
They just call when somethings broke.
Coming to terms with that myself.
Close to self-sufficiency, then*
I was fuxking out of my mind yesturday.
I reminded my daughter that I was the most loyal man she would ever meet. And if she ever needed me. To call me. Even if it's a dead body. Just stop. And call me. Lol
She understood. ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I'm was planning an exit from this home last night.
Changed my mind this morning.

ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I still. Have alot if cocaine and hooker to do before I die.
It's pretty important to feel needed and even wanted.
But I don't wanna be so old I can't be on top. Hahaha
Preach. Important bucket list shit.
It's at my fingertips. Ugh. Fuck.
Lol
Oh, sir. Being on the bottom is absolutely the best. I have a thousand fucks under my belt at this point. Have her hold on for dear life as you fuck. Let her be lazy.
I do t get to have sex with my wife bro.
It's like scheduled and shit
I thought that might have changed some
Kol
Well, ours is pretty scheduled at this point too.
She's a crazy busy woman. Gotta find time for it, and can't always.
I do miss the spontaneity there, but that's just not in the cards (she's embracing her asexuality more too, imho).
I can only imagine now with what she is doing.
I give up. Spent the last month on like 6 websites down the Sar hole of attention seeking behavior.
Dark hole.
Kinda a cyclical thing for me.
So I just ghosted like halved a dozen ppl and deleted all my accounts.
Trying to find the right community is hard.
The gay community loved me. Good God. That was slightly alarming. Bwahaha
Even I've entered into [[Reply Mode]]. You are a rare exception in the past few months actually. That [[vidya]] I sent ya. I do not do that even for my [[Root Users]] except under safety considerations.
I can see why.
I do think life might continue to get lonelier, on average, as we get older.
(and, we have little to complain about in many respects, I realize...not many men our age have wives and children and all the necessities and so forth)
Yeah. I think cheating is my solution. Haha but not trying to balance 6 people and multiple accounts.
Yeah. I'm a pathetic POS. I make no apologies for my temperament
Haha
Different senerio different life don't judge me homo
Lol
Well, you know all my opinions here.
I think it would be a blessing to be bisexual.
It is much, much easier to find men than women.
Got one guitar prodigy I kept and a local couple I actually met in the parking lot at the mall
ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Cut my losses wirh the rest.
Back to normal work for me.
Lol
 No more checking messages obsession.
It's nice to have control of our notifications.
I had issues with that in highbschool college and on and on.
Forgive me for unloading
Lol
I have used you for a leaning post more often than I care to admit
I am not above admiring that.
Just know I'm here too.
When you or if you need it.
And ime there for other grown dads.
[[Killcoin]] being one of them
Probably the best we can do sometimes, I think.
I talk to him daily
Text
Good
I even got him a local plug.
Cause... You gotta know ppl. And I know ppl that know ppl. Lol
I'm afraid to write again.
You should. Every day.
I know.
No one reads. It's all 20 second videos.
It's fun to make them. But they bring me no more joy than television.
I'd say it's hard to find people who will read, but that can be developed.
Which really is just mindless brain occuosncy
I have heard discord was good. But I've tried it twice. And I'm still confused.
Discord has a lot of people and content, no doubt.
I'm not a fan, but I do miss many parts of it. I've left twice as well.
I actually find myself most active in smallengine mechanic groups on Facebook. Lol
Reddit and Discord might or might not have fighting communities for that as well.
Any local fools who enjoy it too?
fitting* communities
It's not stimulating convo.
Nah I'm not into it.
It's just easy to me
ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
