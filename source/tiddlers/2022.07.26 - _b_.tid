If you're a nation-state, like, say, Pakistan, that imports more than than it exports (especially energy) or you've declining foreign investment, you're probably going to suffer domestic currency depreciation as global pressures to sell it skyrocket. If you're a sovereign who has nowhere to push risk except to your own currency, and you're blowing your forex reserves defending said currency against said depreciation due to US-IMF neocolonialism (including cyclical abuse), you're far more likely to default on debts that can only be paid in foreign currencies. Holding off on defaulting by diverting funds that would have gone into public infrastructure into paying foreign debts or making foreign bond payments, or, even worse, borrowing money in a foreign currency to fund expenditures (especially as credit chills or interest rates rise), only exacerbates the crisis of each cycle. Add both (1) the principal-agent problem of corrupt, short-term undemocratic leadership taking bribes for indebting or legalizing the foreign theft of resources from future generations of that society, and (2) capitalists knee deep in unproductive rent-seeking and labor exploitation engaged in regulatory arbitrage and capture to prevent taxation and revolution, and there's little reason to think generations of the proletariat of your nation-state have much [[chance]] of escaping a multi-scoped political prison.

I need to stop giving as much of myself to those who need me the least. I don't work hard enough to fight that [[bias]].

Beyond the wage suppression generated through maintaining an untapped reserve army of labor, a poor person on the streets is usually worth less than nothing to capitalists in the US, but put them behind privatized bars, and at least some of the capitalists benefit from: (1) $40-50k of annual slave labor capital to exploit on top of up to half a million annual tax dollars per prisoner infrastructural costs of incarceration to embezzle; (2) a coercive fear factory backing the nearly invisible signaling lines of unjustified authority everywhere else; and (3) a red herring scapegoat class cyclically screwed for life.

If all you have to fear stems from your memories of pain and all your desire likewise from memories of pleasure: you're probably stuck in the egoistic aesthetic mode. This isn't to say empathy can't provide q-memories that influence us like this, but our [[SO]] desires can be enriched by reasons beyond hedonism. Protip: if you think you get to choose the construction of normativity beyond the mere [[aesthetic|Beauty]] (and even this isn't accurate when fleshed out), like buffet spirituality, rather than simply whether or not you will bind yourself to it, you're still stuck in it. And, yes, you are morally responsible for that.
