!! About:

//Accountably decentralizing personal autonomy is hard. In the relevant pursuit of [[The Salient]], lexically order and prioritize your multi-agent Williamsian weighing; consider your permissions structures with dimensionality. These are the stakeholders+shareholders of my identity. May they virtuously and [[straussian]]ly be Guilds-Creature Navigators, Mentat Senpai Confidants, and Members of The Justified Strain of The Bene Gesserit. Channel Uncle Iroh for me, [[Plato|Saint Plato]]nic Guardians. Help me think, feel, and act [[irwartfrr]]. May you be kaleidoscopically [[beautiful]] [[irwartfrr]]. May I practice what I preach, say as I do and do as I say, dialectically atone and grow, and reach for [[The Good]] as wisely as we can muster. Who do you think I am? Who do you think I should become? This isn't a webring, it's a lifeweb. These are my tard-wranglers, and I am their autistic 4eak. Thank you for doing the lawd's work.//

Your constant vigilance - forged in the fires of autism - does not fool me, however. You are fucking gas. Of course, I love you, you brittle little shit.

One of my favorite parts of [[Find The Others]] is recognizing our interdependence so thoroughly. The experience makes the need for community so obvious to me. I'm lucky to have anyone who has thought so carefully with me about my life. I am honored to be able to trust a network of humans.

!! Principles:

* With skin in the game, you may have me temporarily bracket, [[REDACT]], wrestle with, or [[Question Everything]] regarding anything you pick out. 
* Our conversations can go dark, completely [[private]], even using custom infrastructure. 
** e.g. you'll note that I lack almost any chatlogs with [[1uxb0x]], [[j3d1h]], and [[k0sh3k]] on this wiki.
* You may have read+write access to this wiki. You'll have to choose how you modify it and why. I know you know what this place means to me to a sufficient [[dok]].
* You may have my sensory organs directed and voice wielded in sufficiently private and justified spaces. You have my attention.
* You may have to help me define this place.
* Have the right to post in [[/b/]] too. You may speak anonymously from this ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱.
