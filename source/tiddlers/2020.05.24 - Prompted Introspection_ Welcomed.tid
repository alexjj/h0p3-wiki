title: 2020.05.24 - Prompted Introspection: Welcomed

!! Tell about a time when someone made you feel welcomed or accepted. 

[[2018.12.24 - Prompted Introspection: Feeling Accepted]] is excellent, and I'm simplifying the question. I should note that I'm not convinced that being welcome or accepted is something that I always feel when it occurs, nor can I say that //welcoming// and //accepting// are the same thing. It seems to be something that can be broken into parts and [[dok]]. Prima facie, welcoming and accepting are good things though.

My brothers accept me pretty consistently. They accept my rambling, my wildcard factor, my rabbitholing leaps, my violent interrogation, my preoccupations, my infuriating qualities, and so forth. It's not just one small timeslice, it's a broader lifelong timeslice. Yeah, it's had its ups and downs. Accepting [[The Other]] is expensive.
