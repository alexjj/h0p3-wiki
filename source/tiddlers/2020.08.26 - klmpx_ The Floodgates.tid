title: 2020.08.26 - klmpx: The Floodgates

hello again, sorry to keep flinging my particular type of bs here but you opened up a floodgate in my head so now we're both screwed. I was thinking about the correlation between your duality of 'fast/slow mind' and how it resembles the duality of 'ideal/material'. For example the 'material' perspective correlates to 'slow' mind because to make a decision or think from that perspective you have to account for a million things between possibility and probability, like the past/future, the system of the now, the societal implications, pain/fear, etc etc and one is constantly being either pulled or pressured by two directions, whereas the 'ideal' is unencumbered by this 'material' perspective and therefore correlates to 'fast' mind, like how we can dream for 5 seconds but it feels like 5 hrs. I dunno if that makes sense but I'm just trying to give you different perspectives to compare so you can notice the pattern in between, that's where the true meaning lies, not in the words. I just use 'ideal/material' because it was the best fit for what I had already been thinking about from the perspective I was thinking from but it's proven to be quite useful as it does get at the core of the meaning so that you could than apply and compare it to something as specific as psychological perspective, 'political-economics' or as fundamental as the 'mind-body' duality.

Also! This is very important to understand in order to keep your sanity while looking at things as 4 things and that's the difference between duality and dichotomy, I've never gone this deep trying to explain this to anyone so I don't have the words to explain it but I'll give you examples so you can see the pattern. Mind/body would be an example of duality, while male/female would be its corresponding dichotomy, the combination of these 4 things is what makes up an individual. That individuals perspective of the world in their 'mind-body' would than correlate to 'ideal-material' duality of perspective which creates the correlating dichotomy of 'left/right' (notice the feminine qualities of the left, masculine of the right in 'political' perspective), and this pattern goes on and on and on creating the fabric of reality as we know it.

Ok I'll shut up now, let me know what you think when you read it, and sorry in advance if the manner in which I come across is too 'arrogant' or whatever, I do come of 'too confident' but that's the thing that keeps me sane since I 'sacrificed my ego on the altar of reason'. It makes me a bit disconnected with others in a way while also creating the contradiction of understanding them better than their parents.
