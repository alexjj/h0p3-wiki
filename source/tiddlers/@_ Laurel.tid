The Beinecke was gorgeous. `/thumbs-up`. Today was the second weekend it was available to the public since covid hit (which hit 4 weeks after we moved up here).

I doubt you'll see it, but I thought I should say it. I'd like to meet you in-person. Maybe you could walk with me (or my family [they have wikis too, e.g. [[my daughter|j3d1h]]'s: https://theta.wiki/]) in the Beinecke Library sometime. I'm happy to meet at a time and place of your choosing for whatever activity makes sense to you. You're also welcome for dinner at our table and any travel arrangements you need too.
