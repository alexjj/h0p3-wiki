** I like how you didn't write down how you temporarily solved it, and you skipped all discussion of `wpa-cute` too. You should have caught this in today's [[review]]. Please, use that time to flesh things out further. See your tiddlers as drafts for longer than you have, please.
*[[The Lightning Thief: 19, rough draft]]
** Make sure that you attempt to transform this in your next draft. There will be times where you should start over too (I'm not saying you should in this case), and multiple times even. This is a very painful practice to learn. You have to kill your darlings.
*[[2020.07.01 – Wiki Review: Mad]]
** I am grateful that we both have the latitude and trust to be misinterpreted to some crucial degree. That's an expensive problem, I realize. 
** I admire our ability to argue carefully with each other (most 12yos cannot wrestle a grown madman like you can). You have no idea how awful most people are in this space. You hold what matters in high regard, and I hold that in high regard.
*[[2020.07.01 – TDL: Internet, internet, doesn't work for me yet.]]
** Manjaro seems to make sense here. If you are sticking with Arch, it is because you want to tough it out, not because you are being lazy, right?
*** I suggest you could have i3-Manjaro primitively set up within an hour or so on your machine. (I'd back up my /home partition first just in case, homie...and, as you know, I've been begging for this to be automated onto your desktop (and if you wish, encrypted or plain onto [[m16]]) for quite a while now.)
** How'd you end up fixing your wireless, btw?
** You've got my work on there, but I don't see your mother's. You aren't really fleshing much out either. Aim for that.
*[[2020.07.01 – Prompted Introspection: Coins sides.]]
** This is a surprising answer! You go in a lot of fascinating directions here. Please consider what you've created as simply a brainstorm that hasn't been developed or fleshed out into a fuller draft. I am pleased with this level of brainstorm (in terms of sheer difficulty alone) given the amount of time this was meant to take, but I want you to see that it has a long way to go (which is exciting: you have thoughts worth thinking much, much further about here). Excellent. Thank you.
*[[2020.07.01 – Carpe Diem: Internets]]
** I have that happen all the time when I'm listening to an audiobook too. It takes practice, but eventually it won't bother you so much. You'll just track back.
** I am glad to see some detail.
*[[2020.07.01 – Antipleonasm Analysis: Lottery sight.]]
** Bullshit. That is not an excuse, and you know it. You run your copy of Bob locally. You don't need a network connection beyond the local loop. There are number of work arounds on this, including the ability to pull out a piece of paper and write it down.
** I know you can imagine better things than that too (Should I pull up proof? You will pay extra for that.). You are just mailing this in.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** [[2019.07.02 – Prompted Introspection: I am like, so bad.]]: you are still young. I think if you decided to focus, you would be just fine. If I have to be the one motivating you, will you fail. I'm going to let go. You will sink or swim; it's gonna hurt if you try to breathe water.
