title: 2021.10.06 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: weak little brittle-boned bitches

Woke at 4? Long meditation. [[ASK]]ing. She's feeling some better. Going through all her stuff. Surreal. Old EQ printouts and childhood photos now disposed of. It's a special time in someone's life when they must go through their material possessions and ask how much it really means to them. Sometimes, I think the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 has relieved me of some pressure here. 

She's up. Slowly waking up. She has no idea what she's doing much of today, a pre-blur. //Skintime// and backscritches x2. My drug. Rwandan woman coffee meetup. We had some pumpkin-applebutter on toast with coffee. My son didn't keep records for us to think about whether or not coffee is helping him. We need to do that. 

Motherfuckin' Lol Worlds Play-In! There are no bad teams from the major regions. It's a pleasure. 

Daughter has been [[sharing]] her work more lately. I wonder if she'll cross some thresholds where the passion will just pour. `/fingers-crossed`. She's gonna be joining the Artgroup, possibly. =).

A flash!

[[Pinephone]] failures make me sad. With authentication breaking, I'm stuck doing ugly things for it. =/. Have an old Samsung Galaxy III that I want to turn into an mp3 player. Interestingly, Google services no longer run on it (Cyanogenmod of yore, rooted, etc.), and I'm using sideloaded APKs to get it done. Signal refuses to treat it as anything other than a phone (and it isn't connectable =/). [[Resilio Sync]] is having its fair share of troubles as well (naw, nm, QR codes are pushed through an intermediary: obviously, it should just have the fucking key instead...trapped only seeing whatever the official proxy can see...badjoojoo to my eyes). Syu on [[m16]], as I'd like Mumble to be up-to-date. Jami (a la Gnu Ring) and Jitsi another try. Meh. qTox does screen sharing though.

//The Walk// with my offspring was laxidasic~~a~~ool.<<ref "l">> Vapelyfe. My son continued the permaculture conversation, and we are so nitpicky. Also, apparently, we are weak little brittle-boned bitches. We took an extra-long route. A discussion of [[Straussian]]ism, minimal spoilers on the //Foundation// series to connect some key dots, and my daughter continues to flesh out narratives for us. Her recent piece is neat, maybe vaporwave even (so, ofc I'd like it).

This day two years ago, [[1uxb0x]] said he wanted to "live in moral luxury." I think that's still LifeGoals TM.

We worked downstairs. Thinking of scrapping the glossy layering and just going with a super thick card. Session has been nixed, sadly. So, there's room for one more key. I've tried my fair share of P2P git tooling attempts; I'm cautiously optimistic about radicle's second attempt here. My son is struggling with old keying problems in new copies of user-made manjaro distros. 

//Raw Skintime//. She skished me and told me about her day. 

A wild [[sinan]] appears...`/wave`. He's a person I've been interested in speaking with for couple years now. It's rare that I encounter someone who plays by the rules so well. Reminds me of [[BDS97]]. Chat with [[T-Money]] too. It was a blur/whir of connections all over.

Moar flashes!

[[Family Gathering]]. We had Asha noodles, mushrooms, onions, boiled eggs. I had some chocolate too. We watched the Radioactive episode of //House//. Many comparisons made. It's easy to pigeonhole me, and my wife seemingly impossible. 

[[ASK]]ing. Extremely heavy lifting. Jesus Christ. They've got a fuckton on their plate.

Cleaning. Quick shower. Someone is loud and annoyed that I'm interfering in her life (it's late, and you've not done your schoolwork). I am, clearly, just, the worst. [[TTTOTW]] + LoLWorlds.
