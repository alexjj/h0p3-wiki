* Woke at 11
** Solid sleep. 
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Wife was super busy.
** She "ummms" a lot sometimes.
* Read+Write
* Dialecture
* Talked with [[AA]]
** My messages aren't reaching her on signal (no receipts, makes sense). I'm getting her messages though.
*** I appreciate how she noticed I wasn't responding, lol. 
** She has more chickens, and they will lay different eggs.
** [[AG]] has been having fevers, so work has been no go. She's been using her money to put together a room though, and now she sleeps in her own bed again. She's been feeling better in general.
** [[UJ]] 
** Talked about Ender's Game and Shadow.
** She's been playing FFXIV and Animal Crossing.
** Still no idea how things are going to play out in private or public schools in here area.
** Reinstall on her end fixed it.
* Read+Write
* Offspring working on controlling their own git/proton accounts for their wikis (beyond the others). They want to keep the subdomains. Cool, we'll see if that works.

* [[h0p3ful Review]]
* Fireman Time!
** Why I'm late to pickup the phone, ofc. =)
* [[JRE]] called me
** Had a frank phone discussion with the Elder Marbles. I'm not sure what to think. I appreciate that he aims to be cordial even when he doesn't have to be. I don't think he solved anything, but I think he doesn't think so either. 
** T is normal, cool. Weight loss seems to be working.
** He's getting his freak on.
** Thought about interpreting philosophers
** He's playing //Satisfactory//.
** Matthew is poking his eyes, and Rebecca may be able to stay home to work through the end of the year (perhaps longer).
** Our farts are deadly. XD.
* [[vidya]]: [[Disco Elysium]]
* Vodka + //The Newsroom//. 
** It continues to morph for me.
