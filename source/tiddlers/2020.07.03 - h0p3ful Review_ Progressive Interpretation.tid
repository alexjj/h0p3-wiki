** Dope. =) Glad you burned your freetime reading.
** We will be wrong many times in our wikis, even when we do our best. I appreciate your willingness to think about the truth with so much integrity. It's so expensive.

** Your understanding of roleplaying has become increasingly complex over the years, [[2017.07.03 -- Blessings Log]]. I'm glad you continue to enjoy the blessing of your imagination with others.
