title: 2022.06.24 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Last Day of Vacay

[[TTTOTW]]. At this point, I'm hunting for voices on Tiktok worth subscribing to. [[Antipleonasm]]s are hard to beat. Hate it the infrastructure all I want, I have to hear. Sleep by 3.

Woke at 9 to my sympaticon's signal. Chat with her. [[TTTOTW]]. //Skintime// with my amor. Fireman Time!

Hugs'n'bugs. People are chillin' today (it is vacation). Starting to pack. I don't want to have to worry about it when I see the boys. Also, I'm gonna try not to dadnap, as I want to pass out early tonight (after [[hope]]fully a walk with my sympaticon). 

[[Morning Routine]]. [[Jibberjabber]] with [[Rb]]. Termination trial in Sept, and the paperwork is already beginning for making the file fit for the adoption worker. Dope. Still projects 9 months after that. There is nothing we can do but wait (and, I suppose, that was all we ever could do, since we were going to do the rest either way). With biomom dropping out of comms with the state, this may go smoothly. `/fingers-crossed`.

[[TTTOTW]]. Thinkin' about how my son will travel back. He's not happy with multiple connections, and we're discovering it is not so easy sending a young person on their own over contemporary national transportation systems (not like when we were young). He set up VPN access just in case.

We ate pho. Vapelyfe. It was delicious. 

//Everything Everywhere All At Once//. [[Rb]]'s first, and we did our best not to speak too much (though, ofc, it bleeds out of us). Lots of small things on the second watch through. The grown men cried, the others laughed. Helluvamovieitellyawhat. I am not convinced the reasoning behind the nihilism makes any real sense (the Platonic realm, they have a version of it I suppose, is exactly why I know it matters, after all). 

Dishes. Prep house for the boys. Snacks. [[1uxb0x]] has decided he is not staying. `/nod`. He heard me out more than once. Alright. Vapelyfe. [[TTTOTW]].

The boys came in, jumped to me, and gave me hugs. [[Q]] stuck around and played with my camera and me. Picks up new words fast. Rested for a bit, and chilled with the boys some more.

Made pizza and had some beer. Watched some //Stranger Things// with [[Rb]].

//The Walk// with my sympaticon. Relaxed. Friday night parties in the hood, lots of kids on the edges of the streets. 

Brix. [[TTTOTW]]. Le Tenant haunts.
