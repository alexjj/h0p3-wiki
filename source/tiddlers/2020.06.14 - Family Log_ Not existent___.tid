title: 2020.06.14 - Family Log: Not existent???

!! Write a paragraph summarizing each person's week given the wikis:

* [[1uxb0x]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I've been getting more freetime this week. It's rare that I do so well in work, I think I may be improving better than normal. I hope I keep on in this route. I'm happy about my work on the infinite. (I hates it I tell ya!)
** j3d1h
*** You did a good job taking notes while I set the Git scripting up. You asked some pretty good questions, when prompted, and you took decent charge when I asked you to fix a problem with yours. I think you've been working harder on your daily logs, and there's certainly more personality put into them. Your Francis Hutcheson notes were beautiful - you did a better job than I did, in that regard! Your sentences have something different about them, I can't quite put my finger on it. They have better structure, and they really sound like you.
** k0sh3k
*** Thank you for your work for me this week! You did a good job. (You now have TWO STORE DOLLARS.) I hope you will think harder about the difference between fiction and not true; sometimes, it's easier to say things that are true through fiction than through nonfiction. We need to think about how to tag your schoolwork for me.
** h0p3
*** [[1uxb0x]] has been feeling stressed, and it's been an uphill battle this week. [[Ten Things you need to know about the Future]] was interesting. He's been taking down that [[Notage]] consistently. He's set up his git and proton accounts by shadowing his sister. He's been trying to rigorously reason about some of the precepts of calculus and [[The Infinite]]. He's been jotting down notes about //1984// in his [[Carpe Diem]] log. His notes and presentation on [[Francis Hutcheson]] were a valuable contribution to our discourse. He has not been listening closely enough to his father this week, but it's obvious that he's still trying to be constructive. He got some of his room clean (and helped his sister with hers). It's been fun {[[dreaming]]} about [[urban-survival.tdl]] with him; he appreciates what it means in some crucial senses.

* [[j3d1h]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I am suprised that you didn't go to get the 2 dollars. When you were younger you probably would've worked to get those 2 dollars of anything. I love your notes. I remember asking you what you were going to do and you telling my cyborgs, it's odd that you didn't ever have a tiddler for it.. The end "grog" in your notes is amazingly funny.
** j3d1h
*** I've felt far less motivated this week, just in general. I'm not sure what it is, really. I do have a lot of drawings on my mind, so I should try to get those done. h0p3ful reviews have been much smoother than they used to. I like that I'm thinking about my worldbuilding and such in logs, not only in my head.
** k0sh3k
*** What do you think the evolutionary "push" was to make humans generally risk takers? We are the prime instigators of the sixth mass extinction, yay? I really liked your Lightning Thief paper. I am disappointed you didn't write the cyborg paper; I will add that to your work for next week. 
** h0p3
*** [[j3d1h]] is often my peer. That is a rare luxury and privilege for me. I await the day when the asymmetry flips, where I will not understand her as well as she understands me. I [[hope]] to be a [[good]] student of hers qua [[BAGD]]. In terms of accountability, she has been more dishonest than usual this week; however, she has been sociable. If feels like her notetaking has strengthened this week, but her schoolwork has suffered. Her wiki work and [[h0p3ful Review]], taking more ownership of her wiki infrastructure, welcoming her brother as shadow, and her clear discussions have been delightful.

* [[k0sh3k]]
** 1uxb0x
*** Your poem was suprisingly misinterpreted, some said it was cool and some got the point. It's bad that one even thought it was about your childhood. I'm happy your ankle is usable now. I've noticed dads bead toy and I don't see him using it in the way he normally would like, at all. I love your joke about domesticating my father.
** j3d1h
*** Tuesday's prompted introspection is awesome! I know you're busy, but if you can, I think you should write things like that more often! Thank you again for helping on my school plans. I'm sorry I didn't mention your files - I hope to fix that soon! Your poem was amazing, even if some people didn't catch the message.
** k0sh3k
*** I wrote a second poem. I don't feel another poem in me, at the moment. I guess I'll just make some more rosaries. I like h0p3's fidget, but I might break it down and make it longer. I like how I've planned out the kids' school year with them; I think, as long as they stick to it, it'll go well. I think all the subjects are interesting, and I hope they do, too. I'm surprised I didn't write more about Chairman Meow's foot.
** h0p3
*** [[k0sh3k]] has been pulled in many directions this week, and we see the beginning of the end of most of her time during the weekdays with us approaching. She's been running the show at the library, and that has been expensive. She's been writing poetry, and it's a been a useful object for interpreting the people around her as they interpret her (for lack of a better term) qualiatic Grogginese (or is k0shiquanese?). I am exceptionally grateful when she [[domesticates me|2020.06.08 - Prompted Introspection: Monday]]. Her ankle is doing much better, and she's been more physically active (awww yeaaah, boii!!). Walks have been tremendous. I wish there was more time in the week because I missed her AFF. Shopping with her was a privilege. Oh, and she made a sick bone-beaded chewtoy noisemaker stimmable fidget chaplet for me. <3.

** 1uxb0x
*** I was looking at [[this|https://twitter.com/suzydymna/status/1271062190032855046]] when you caught me. It's horrifying that people would think the left would love Trump, and I don't think that they're making a joke. I'm happy that you've been talking with some more people this week. I was loving the camping idea, but I am partially agreeing with my mother, I don't think we should do it now.
** j3d1h
*** Working on the philosophers timeline is a good project so far. I like that we get to see so many different points of view. You've talked to a lot of new people recently. Your TW Canvassing is a great idea. It's a shame urban survival won't work out for now, but it's something to think about nonetheless.
** k0sh3k
*** I liked Dr. Pearson a lot; he let me play with his snake. No one has time to actually respond to DJT [[as often as he tweets|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump_on_social_media#Rate_of_tweets]]. It is nice to have everyone like you; I enjoy it immensely. Thank you for sending me hoaxes! That will come in handy. 
** h0p3
*** [[h0p3]] has been doing a lot of [[FTO]] work, and he's been lucky to speak with friends, family, and strangers. He's been reaching out to trained philosophers this week, and that's cool. TW Canvassing has become a daily habit. He's been happy to work in the philosophy timeline with his offspring, and it has given him many ideas. His work is feeling overloaded, fragmented, and just-in-time. Walking has been amazing. He feels embedded in the lives of a community of people across the world, doing his small part.
