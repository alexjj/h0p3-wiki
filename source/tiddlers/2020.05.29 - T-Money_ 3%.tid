How's the week going for ya?
May 28 1:37pm

Finally glad it's the weekend. How are you sir?
May 29 10:51pm
Fuck yeah.
May 29 10:51pm
I'm 2 glasses of wine in. Eating someone who claims to be a cop alive.
May 29 10:51pm
Yes. Proud of you. I'm off call and drinking alcohol! Lol
May 29 10:52pm
Haha, noice.
May 29 10:52pm
I'm glad you are off call.
May 29 10:53pm
What is the schedule like for being on call?
May 29 10:53pm
and, are you finally off the computers?
May 29 10:53pm
Finally had two aircraft in today to work on.
May 29 10:53pm
Good.
May 29 10:53pm
Suppose to be moving me to Friday and Saturdays off call. On call the rest.
May 29 10:54pm
I've done more inventory control at this job than I have working on helicopters.
May 29 10:54pm
I have taken alot of "joking" "being picked on and made fun of" up to this point. I usually try not to get into that cause I come across supper arrogant and mean. Not funny.
May 29 10:55pm
You'll have your chance, lol.
May 29 10:56pm
But I have been quiet enough. It's time to get savage, slowly.
May 29 10:56pm
Aye
May 29 10:56pm
Either way. They are way over paying me for what I am doing.
May 29 10:58pm
Lol
May 29 10:58pm
Sick.
May 29 10:58pm
It sucks to be a sensitive soul though. With anxiety and depression. Lol.
May 29 11:00pm
Such is life.
May 29 11:01pm
How is the claimed cop Holding up?
May 29 11:01pm
He doesn't want to come out to play. `/cry`. We'll see. I'm giving him both the rope to hang himself and the chance to prove he's a human who merits his life.
May 29 11:03pm
I don't know many police officers. If any. I've had both bad and good experiences.
May 29 11:08pm
I've never met a good one.
May 29 11:09pm
I've gotten pulled over alot for speeding. Also while carrying a handgun. Gotten very few tickets.
May 29 11:10pm
I'm also white and obviously on my way to work.
May 29 11:11pm
Considering texting him. He should talk with me.
May 29 11:36pm
Lol. How did you come across him?
May 29 11:37pm
Plebbit. https://www.reddit.com/r/TikTokCringe/comments/gsnl88/this_is_america/
May 29 11:37pm
Hard to find it on my phone. Looks like her might have deleted his comment.

I'm at the bottom with him.

Verdict is not so good, but better than I anticipated.
May 30 12:42am
Reading now. He acts sincere. But hides behind "what I want you to think"  vs "what really happened" my quick anyalsis.
May 30 12:43am
I've read his 6 years of posts. There is some good in him, but I'm not convinced he's a worthy human.
May 30 12:49am
And, he definitely should never have been a cop.
May 30 12:49am
Who is a worthy human? Shit I know I ain't. Haha
May 30 12:50am
I believe about 3% of the adult population are.
May 30 12:50am
At the same time "I never asked to be born"
May 30 12:50am
That rate might get higher outside the developed world.
May 30 12:50am
We don't have a choice in our birth lottery, but we have plenty of choices about who we will be. That's what makes us worthy.
May 30 12:51am
I have next to zero faith in humanity to be worthy. I'm just trying to keep. My own head above water. I've stepped on a few people along the way. But I'll be damned if I'm gonna drown for their sake. Sad but true.
May 30 12:55am
I know.
May 30 12:55am
Back to reading this juicy cop and you tango.
