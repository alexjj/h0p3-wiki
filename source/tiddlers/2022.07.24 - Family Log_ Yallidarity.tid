* 1uxb0x
** It's been alright.
* j3d1h
** waking up way too early, probably just the heat.
* k0sh3k
** Overheating, which is unusual for me; that made my exhaustion just so much worse. Migraine without the headache, which is still so weird. And bad nightmares.
* h0p3
** Dadnaps and rumination galore. Been having what feel like seizures in my stomach. Some overheating.
* ASK
** Not so very good. I'm sleeping more but I am also more tired. everything hurts. suck. on the plus side my head feels less like it is filled with pissed off tapioca. Nightmares are really bad. it cycles.

!! What was interesting to you last week?

* D2, Severance, The Boys, Hyperion, Kielbasa, Cake that Killed, a giant moth that did not make it but the cats are okay with that. A single giant wing still lies at the foot of the stairs. It was the biggest wild moth I had ever seen in person. Now I want to watch some Kaiju.
** I n d e e d.
*** Quite
* People have been tired this week. Pretty much everyone.

* Multiple tirejacks came in handy.
* Recession/Depression/Food-Supply-Chain-Disruption preparation
* The downstairs got cleaned, and //The Shop// is functioning nicely again.
* Sweet, blessed AC and fans and cold showers.
* My week was good. I'm still getting unlikable amounts of sleep, but it is improving. I had my ears cleaned deep, which I should probably continue to get those cleaned because they are probably not fully cleaned. My work has been much better as of late, and I am gonna try to improve. I've been basically only been playing diablo 2 and rimworld.
* Bowchika continues to grow. Rise up! I'm enjoying this avoidance-tank glass-cannon. She is better than I thought she would be, though still weak AF.
* Getting the library storage closet cleaned out led to the discovery of a treaure trove of bookends, and the acquisition of some spare computer bits.

!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family (including ourselves)?

* 1uxb0x
** I think I have well balanced games and work.
** I appreciate your clarity and verbosity in your mathematics notetaking. I [[hope]] you make it rain, sir.
** Thank you for the work on our emergency water supply and fixing my mistake.
** I like how thoughtful and prepared you are to present your side when you disagree - like this morning, with your clothes, you made a good argument and you made it gently and clearly. I appreciate it, and it's an excellent skill to develop. 
** Your puns are high quality and dank. Well done.
** thank you for attempting to get some items for cecil :]
* j3d1h
** i like how quickly i can connect with other writers and artists.
** Thank you for pitching in, pulling your weight, and defeating the tragedy of the commons with us in [[The Alien Asylum]]. You are integral part of our micro-society, and you enable our machine to thrive inside a much more hostile machine that surrounds it.
** I enjoyed quibbling about your symbolic logic brainteaser.
** I appreciate that you had us [[pause]] //Stranger Things// to read the code.
** I am glad you are the sort of person who listens when your friends are having serious mental struggles. I hope you will be careful to not let it hurt your own mental wellbeing; finding and keeping that balance can be difficult. 
** Thank you for not actually smothering your brother. 
*** ...for now :)
** Thank you for helping me look for music.
** Thank you for sharing your art with me!
* k0sh3k
** I have been better this week at recognizing my state of being at work and taking time to chill when I need it. Also about leaving on time, rather than getting caught up and forgetting to leave. 
** You've had a lot of temperature changes through out the day, handling other people's circuses, nightmares, exhaustion, health problem, and a pretty miserable week in many ways. I think it's fair to say you've not been happy much of your days this week. You still mustered the energy to be with us and to think about our lives with us. Thank you.
** The school .plans are another rung up the ladder. It's well-conceived. May they understand and use it well.
** I enjoyed shopping with you, especially for school supplies. You are cute AF. 
*** You've also been thoughtful about the ReMarkable 2 and your digital infrastructure too. Thank you.
** Thanks for cleaning out my ears.
** Thank you for the fingernails.
** Thank you for taking delightful photos. They look great, psychedelic too, imho.
** thank you for the new school plans!
* h0p3
** I work very hard to respect the dignity of the personhood of those with profound mental illnesses.
** Thank you for going school shopping with me and helping me to make wise(r) choices.
** I've enjoyed playing and talking about d2 with you.
** i like that you're willing to try newfangled things, or at least observe them without too much bias.
** Thank you for spending so much time with me. I have really been enjoying our time together. I may never forgive you for 'It's Always Sunny,' but I will no longer be saying that you have bad taste in television. I will consider that a deviancy because otherwise you have pretty excellent taste.
* ASK
** I've liked what little music that I've heard that you have.
** Thank you for finding this perfect desk setup. It works well. We should find a chair you find comfortable.
** Thank you for working so hard on the basement with me. It looks good and functions well.
** You are skilled at making meals that have [[good]] leftovers, and you also are thoughtful about adjusting how much food to make.
** Thank you for managing all the snacks. They have been [[awe]]some.
** thanks for the pathfinder resources!
** Thank you for organizing and watching over the snack stash, so the kids don't eat them all at once.
