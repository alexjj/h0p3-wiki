<<<
Woke at 3:30. Meditation. Fireman Time! Hugs'n'bugs. [[TTTOTW]]. 

[[ASK]] and I made breakfast. Leftover tatertots became dope hashbrowns, eggs, and millennial toast. Watched classic phone conversation on the youtubes.

Dadnap. Fireman Time! Meditation.

//Skintime// with mi amor. She tired. Put her to sleep (without a chokehold...this time.)

[[ASK]] is awake! //Skintime// + //One ~~Piece~~ Place// + lemonade. [[TTTOTW]]. Orange Dark Chocolate is expensive, $3 for the sheet, but it is kinda insane. 

[[Family Time]] was smooth. It went by very quickly, imho (though, just as many hours as usual). Vapelyfe.

Burritos + salsa. //Sherlock//, the Hounds episode (yuck). 

Shopping @ W-Entity with my sympaticon. Thinking about clearing out the laundry room/utility area further, and I want to put my stuff under my mattress (which is on the floor, and, I don't mind it being on the floor, but it is a waste of space). They don't have enough storage bins that are strong enough, and I'm going to have to order it online. While in the aisle, a wild Lynn appeared. `/wave`. Carded. She just started talking to me out of no where (dope AF, tyvm, love it). She might be in trouble. Covid has done a number on her mom and especially her son. Said she'll be [[sharing]] the card with her son (who is a "baby" a couple years older than me, <3 [hey there, homie]).

//Skintime// with [[ASK]] + //One Place// + //ATLA//.

Woke at 6? Meditation. She's up. Hugs'n'bugs. Blankets smell too much like cum. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time!

[[ASK]] is up! //Skintime// + planning our days + //ATLA//. Laundry. Made breakfast. Millennial toast + mandarins + eggs + water. [[TTTOTW]].

A wild [[tset]] appears...

[[TTTOTW]]. Check-in with offspring. Shovel and salt the snow. Gonna go ghetto with our electric dryer and catch some lint/moisture with a mesh bag but let it heat us down here. We'll see if the moisture is unacceptable. I can say that the house has tended to be too dry for me, so it might be just fine. 

We chilled in the kitchen and thought about the implications of our raptor languages. Made tuna fish sammiches for the boys (since we're the only folks who will eat that delicious stuff<<ref "s">>). [[TTTOTW]].

Dadnap while [[ASK]] made lipbalm.

Offspring came down to grind. Laundry. They are scripting. Prep for dinner. [[MTG]] with [[ASK]] as we munched on high fructose snacks. Radiators have been bled (no need this time), and I'm going to put that tool up downstairs now. Cleaning.

Mi amor and I hit the lot again. She likes it, and it's rational enough to my eyes. Can trade-in. Cool. I think she'll be happy with it. Although, we noted an allergic reaction in her last night. Skin has hives, and her eyes aren't doing great. Can't take anti-allergy meds because she cannot sleep with them, at all. 

//Inform the Men!// Meditation. Shower of the gods!

[[TTTOTW]]. Finished off the match with [[ASK]]. Neck and neck.

[[Family Gathering]] was delicious. Pulled pork and salad. More [[pausing|Pause]] than usual for talking. First adoption attempt episode of //House//.

//Skintime// with [[ASK]] + //ATLA//. Sleep by 9?
