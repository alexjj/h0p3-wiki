[18:22:35][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] hey, whats this tiddly wiki thing?
[18:22:45][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] it looks interesting
[18:23:18][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] is it like trilium notes but with HTML5?
[19:04:38][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] huh this is interesting
[19:04:47][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] thanks for the ezwiki
[19:05:08][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] and the southpark. itll be in my share soon.
[20:21:11][h0p3] Hello there, [[nomad]].
[20:22:16][h0p3] Tiddlywiki is a very flexible tool in some respects. You can make it do what trilium does, and a lot more. 
[20:22:36][h0p3] It's nicely wrapped up in a single html file, and I think that's pretty darn useful.
[20:23:13][h0p3] Your library is fascinating. Was talking about your name and your files with [[k0sh3k]] and [[ASK]] just a bit ago as we were shopping for fruit.
[20:23:34][h0p3] How'd you come up with your name?
[20:23:52][h0p3] Are you a fan of this episode: https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/The_Defector_(episode)?
[20:25:14][h0p3] We just watched that [[Everything Everywhere All At Once|Film: Exploration]] during [[Family Time]]. I wept through the end of it.
[20:26:40][h0p3] https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/The_Outside_of_the_Asylum for your name?
[20:27:14][h0p3] We call our home, [[The Alien Asylum]].
[20:52:39][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] Yes. There was a character in the hitchikers radio play who made the outside of his home the asylum,  large brick walls, flooring, uncomy chairs. and the inside was outside the asylum, and was decorated with lots of plants and open space
[20:54:35][h0p3] If you end up making your wiki [[public|PSM]], I'd definitely read it.
[20:56:09][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] the-outside-of.the-asylum.xyz not much there yet, other than your legal notice, I quite liked it.
[20:56:42][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] I've been writing a peice about the american dream i intend on putting there once i finish it
[20:56:46][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] if i ever do.
[20:57:35][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] but theres quite a few sources. and I was hoping I could find something like this that i could make public. being able to include the full text of the source gets me off.
[20:58:29][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] so right now its just test phase, learning all the things. 
[20:59:06][h0p3] I've set my Firefox to watch for [[change]]s. 
[21:00:09][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] Are you a philosophy student? or just an observer?
[21:00:19][h0p3] Always a student.
[21:00:39][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] i like that
[21:01:14][h0p3] How about you? What do you do to survive in the world? How do you enjoy spending your precious free time?
[21:02:57][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] Trying to stay sober. I sell oolong tea at a local park
[21:03:24][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] usually pass out a zine or two
[21:05:05][h0p3] You got a place to sleep at night?
[21:05:09][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] I have a very DFW relationship with pleasure, even the manufactured kind.
[21:06:03][h0p3] I definitely appreciate the pursuit of pleasure.
[21:06:27][h0p3] Œî‚Å∏ is what I've been using lately.
[21:06:42][h0p3] Lots of other ways to achieve pleasure, I realize.
[21:06:45][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] yeah i live in a tent on some property i own. luckily my neighbor has wifi. I mostly rely on solar for electricity, If I need some at night extra i might start my truck. 
[21:06:52][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] my DOC was acid
[21:07:29][h0p3] A fantastic substance. Though, people who may be prone to schizophrenia should perhaps not use, from what I understand.
[21:08:05][h0p3] Acid permanently alters openness to some degree. 
[21:08:15][h0p3] Can't use it very often either, which is interesting.
[21:08:29][h0p3] What machines do you have?
[21:09:29][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] I thank my LSD expirences every day as a schizo. It's very different kind of hallucination. But it helped me be grounded in reality long-term. made it a lot easier to recognize that my perceptions are lying to me.
[21:09:46][h0p3] `/nod`. Very expensive experience, imho.
[21:10:08][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] Just a laptop, and a few items in my truck to make tea
[21:10:09][h0p3] Schizos unite, friend.
[21:10:44][h0p3] I live in CT, US, btw, in case that may matter.
[21:10:56][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] swamp boy
[21:11:13][h0p3] I treasure my time in Baton Rouge and New Orleans. 
[21:11:27][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] I used to sell tea in new orleans
[21:11:32][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] back before i was sober
[21:12:51][h0p3] What do you [[hope]] to express in your piece about the American Dream?
[21:13:19][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] Its really more about education, and managing expectations
[21:13:31][h0p3] Have you ever visited this place: https://www.reddit.com/r/sorceryofthespectacle/ ? (I suppose I should ask as well, have we ever met?)
[21:14:11][h0p3] An appreciable [[stoic]] problem.
[21:15:39][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] my generation (im 28) were schooled around the idea of 90's call centers. We were graded quite often in a mandatory class on the microsoft office suite. yet, when we became working class citizens, that nice doesn't really exist in our modern world
[21:16:06][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] and I think I have not. But who knows
[21:17:12][h0p3] I can't say I'm a fan of schools in the US, though I'm a fanatic about education. 
[21:17:57][h0p3] What do you wish you learned in high school instead? If you got to draw up the curriculum, or what speech or story should they all hear? 
[21:18:34][h0p3] Not necessarily a pleasurable experience to write on, but there's some to be had in it, I think.
[21:19:28][h0p3] I'm 36, btw. I bet we have quite a bit in common.
[21:20:19][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] now that I'm older. Basically everything from highschool has fallen out of my head. However, I quite enjoy educating myself on topics of interest. I believe in a dewey school system. Just encouraging children to explore the vast resouces they have at their fingertips. and then testing them on basic comprehension.
[21:20:34][h0p3] Preach, yo.
[21:20:42][h0p3] Something to be said for an unschooling mentality. 
[21:20:56][h0p3] Profoundly pragmatic, even.
[21:21:13][h0p3] I think TW (Tiddlywiki) is an amazing tool for lifelong learning, btw.
[21:21:46][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] when i was a child, I had a friend from a nerdy summer camp, her grandma ran a dewey school in japan, and most of her alumni are in very specialized technical fields now that we're older.
[21:22:28][h0p3] Makes sense, especially for the ADHD variety who can hyperfocus, and the autistics who are lost in their own worlds so often, and the schizophrenics who connect all the dots.
[21:23:16][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] In my personal expirence. I have more problems not connecting dots than I do connecting them.
[21:23:42][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] once you see an edge
[21:23:42][h0p3] I'm not good at it myself, though I try. 
[21:23:47][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] all you can see are edges
[21:23:54][h0p3] [[infingress]]es
[21:24:07][h0p3] [[infinigress]]es*
[21:24:37][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] I guess thats a way of putting it
[21:24:42][h0p3] What's your thoughts on [[certainty]]?
[21:25:20][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] It is my firm belief, that it is a mistake to hold firm beliefs.
[21:25:28][h0p3] `/nod`.
[21:25:50][h0p3] Dogmatically Undogmatic 
[21:25:56][h0p3] Tolerance into oblivion
[21:26:08][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] What are your thoughts on religion?
[21:26:19][h0p3] I think we're all religious, inescapably. 
[21:27:44][h0p3] I use the word religion (and its variations and synonyms) quite often in my ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±. Not sure [[hao]] best to condense it down. 
[21:28:02][h0p3] What do you think matters most?
[21:28:17][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] community
[21:28:25][h0p3] Amen.
[21:28:44][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] and not the discord communities of modern day, I mean the people in your direct, local, community
[21:29:11][h0p3] I can appreciate that, no doubt.
[21:29:45][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] but thats nothing super new.
[21:30:06][h0p3] I don't care if it's nothing super [[new]]. 
[21:30:47][h0p3] I am convinced we can build online communities that matter, but I think it's exceptionally hard and rare. 
[21:30:58][h0p3] [[Discord]] is an example of a failure, in my eyes.
[21:31:22][h0p3] What's it like building community in your area? 
[21:32:12][h0p3] My [[Root User]], Sir Brother [[DeathOfRobinhood]], is an exceptionally wise community builder, in my view. I [[aim]] to be even half as [[good]] as he is. 
[21:32:35][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] Hard. But we make it work. I think our biggest problem is the area, I live in a very rural... and traditional area. 
[21:32:56][h0p3] How do they treat you?
[21:34:08][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] After they get to know me? The same as anyone else. but grandmas don't like tattoos, I think I put off a lot of people because of my vaguely intimadating appearence. Though, I wouldn't hurt a fly
[21:34:47][The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum] my laptop battery is gonna go in a bit though. It was nice making your aquantiance
[21:35:13][h0p3] Thank you. It was my honor. I am always reachable, and I do my best to respond thoroughly.
