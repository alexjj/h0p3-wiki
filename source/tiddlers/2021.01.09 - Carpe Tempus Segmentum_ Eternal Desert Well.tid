title: 2021.01.09 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Eternal Desert Well

* Woke at midnight
** Amazing sleep. Weird dreams. 
* Try To Take Over The World
* Fireman Time!
* //House of Cards//
* Sleep by 8
* Woke at 2?
* Called [[JRE]]
** [[AIR]] may be moving sooner. Eviction process has begun.
** Δ⁸ was almost as good as LSD for him. Sublingual, 30 minutes to hit. That's crazy. Lucky dog!
** Work will likely begin soon.
* Try To Take Over The World
* [[Morning Routine]] sans the fun
* Asked if they were proud of how they used their time. Asked them if I would agree. Do you want to think about our difference? No? Okay. I love you.
* ⁸Δ⁸
* Shopping
** Aldi
*** Cashier was cool. Soda for her.
*** We got the basics. We needed fruits and veggies and bread and milk and potatoes. Pantry is fine.
*** Went slow, tons of people. Cashier said this was not even close to as busy as she has seen this month. 
** Breadstore
*** Technically cheaper, but not worth the extra trip. Only for bulk, I think. 
** W-Entity
*** Missing food acquired
*** Containers for craft supplies
* Dialecture
** All parties can see as clearly as I can make it. We are in agreement I am being rational and patient. This is where years of moves have taken us.
* Meeting with insurance agent.
** I'm an awkward person to have in the room, lmao. Kept asking if I was listening.
*** You know what I'm doing, sir. I've handed all the proofs you need, and you know that too.
** He went way too slowly. Eventually, I knew what he wanted me to tell him. If she dies, we have options. Less than death, we do not.
*** Asked for a day to think. Will be two before he's up to chat again. 
*** $88 a month for 4k/month upon illness or disability. That's fucking expensive, but it would buy time for a significant change without the same emergency. 
*** Still need to read more about whether or not these actually tend to pay out fairly. 
*** Testing for it, etc (glad she's drinking water, if it would be soon). Insurance for this year or two makes sense. It could break us, easy.
*** Virus(es) are still on track to hit upwards of 70% of adults, right? I cannot predict we will be an exception. May my life be irrelevant to their survival at this point. 
** Continue to look into paying the mortgage faster. That is a place to squeeze. 
* My son isn't feeling good. He's feeling the heat from my daughter too. He's being kind. 
** Comforting and thinking. 
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Fishsticks + veggies + coffee
** Wide range of practical matters
* Continued planning rooms. They know they can get this done after school as well. 
** Working in stages. Continue to {[[Dream]]} with them. 
** Both agree that I'm [[aim]]ing to hand them autonomy as effectively as I know how. I require cooperation in some places still.
* Fridge whiteboard otw. One for chores, the other for whatever.
* Bedroom nookboards otw.
* A communal tub has been generated. Freebies.
* Bathroom got organized again. We keep getting closer. 
** Bulk/Overflow also making more sense. 
* Daughter is annoyed by loss of Discord. She is doing something on her machines. I know what her {[[Focus]]} looks like. 
* Worked on [[k0sh3k]]'s room
** Coat hangar is up. Worried about the weight. That is not a great door. Glued as well, just in case. 
** Old lamp works well. Might want another near that mirror.
** Aesthetic combat station is clean and operational.
*** Ironically, the station might not be pretty, but it functions.

It was a controllably horny day. It was a productive day when not thinking with my penis as much. Shit got done.
