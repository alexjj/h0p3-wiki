;How long do you anticipate it will take Selah to heal?

Her arm is coming along well, but her perineum, we expect no less than two months. She already takes daily epsom salt sits, so we think those are helping. My role during this time is to make her comfortable, make sure we never go anywhere without her sitting pillow, and prepare the salt waters. Foot massages too.

;If you got room on the floor for 3 of us (we have our sleeping bags), j3d1h and 1uxb0x can come

That would be awesome! Yes, we would have room (though admittedly, we would be a bit squished). We have a spare mattress and a sofa if ever, but if you have at least one extra sleeping bag, we'd have some assurance that no one ends up on the floor. What do you (plural) tend to like to do when you're in a new place?

;Don't be shy with pictures (I am unfloodable). She's gonna look different by the time I get to hold her! How's she eating and sleeping?

Pictures sent (with one more). She's voracious and is always wanting to eat. She came out 6.9 pounds and lost half a pound in the days following, but has been steadily increasing since then. We expect her to fill out in a couple of months. She's having breast milk exclusively so far.

She's sleeping more during the day currently, and seems to be most awake between 6 PM and 4 AM. I'm taking the early morning shifts these days and am enjoying the quiet moments with her (except for when she is screaming inconsolably (though her screaming isn't really all that bad rn)). 

;Everything set on the job front?

I have 5 weeks off, partially paid. I can take even more from a combined pool with Selah, but we're not planning on doing that yet (maybe I will take more if you come up :)). We've got two shows going live in the fall, and two more (shorter) projects lined up that should take us into the winter.

I'm also taking some time during my pat leave to update my demo reel (last time was 2015) and my website. Toyed with the idea of maybe using Tiddlywiki for that, but haven't seen any examples yet of TW handling images and embedded videos quite they way I'd want. 

If you're curious what my first site as a perfesshunal looked like, you can view it here:

Also, bonus content: I decided to participate in a Reanimate collab during my first week as a dad just to let off some steam. What it is is a group of animators who organize on Tumblr to recreate, scene for scene, an episode of an old cartoon. This year's entry is a scene from the Super Mario show:https://youtu.be/eDP-D53zbE0
