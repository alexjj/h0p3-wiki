<<footnotes "f" "Frazee, you aint crazy. I love you. You amazing, homie. Thank you for your honest efforts and good works. You serve Humanity more wisely than almost anyone I've encountered. You are like a Saint to me, sir. I'd wash and kiss your feet, and your asshole too (`/wink`). I'm a saint whore, can't get enough. We're privileged to have you in The World.">>
