Awful Trend: let me describe what's wrong with ~~socialism~~ collectivism by describing ~~capitalism~~ individualism. I project this projection will continue.

''''#oFfMyChesT: Like, I don't //really// care what you think, but when poople copy me, I feel less authentic and unique, like they've misappropriated my personal culture (that's my intellectual property!), failed to respect and give eternal credit to my unique self-created style, ignored the epic struggles imbued in my aesthetic, blasphemously misdirected the worship I deserve from others onto lesser beings, and reminded me that my own mental states (let alone justifications for them) don't completely originate with me either. I begin to feel like a hypocrite, and everything that I take to be valuable about myself is called into question since I'm left with existential anxiety from questioning whether or not I'm really at the center of the universe anymore (I'd rather deny there was real meaning in the world if it's not the one I made up). This is completely unacceptable. My attractiveness is my personality, #iamthemaincharacter, I'm trying to be //The// Original, and you're messing that up. Kill The Imposter.

I can't say I know how to do it well enough. The primary responsibility of a parent is the justified adultification of young humans. Parents can be friendly right up until that line conflicts. There are many cases in which we are obligated to engage in defection in [[Gradual]]ized [[T42T]] (and our personhood likely begins to sprout at 16mo). You [[aim]] to create a peer or higher from the principal position. There are cases in which the parent must simulate the consequences of The World because there are some kinds of mistakes that you can't take back or fix. Anti-fragile training requires constructing massive cognitive and affective surpluses rather than operating at peak efficiency because their longevity is often in virtue of how they perform during moments of real or perceived crisis (often it reveals what we're made of). More problematically, given the extremely high rates of actual dark-triadism in 1st World Nations (though it is uncouth to speak of such things), we're required to consider the likelihood of it in our own, to prepare accordingly, to be able to account for at least both lines of possibility from the wisest unified perspective we can muster, [[WINTCIS]].

A Capital Idea: Sell landmines disguised as prayer mats. Prophets are gonna go through the roof.
