title: 2021.01.04 - Prompted Introspection: April

!! Have you ever dated someone who you felt was below your standards?

If we're talking about serious dating, no, or at least not at the time.<<ref "a">> Having been married for 16 years, I feel like my understanding of my wife's fitness has clarified my standards. She is my ultra-sensor of the world and a [[gem]] through which I judge all. She shapes my understanding of [[gfwiwcgws]] and [[The Good]] as I can [[fff]]ingly perceive [[It]]. 

April was a special woman to me.<<ref "g">> I think we could have done alright. We spent a non-trivial amount of time together, and we had a lot of the important stuff in common. She was smart and she could put up with my insanity well enough too (maybe a decade or two would be far too much, though I doubt we'd have offspring like the ones I have). Does she live up to the standards that [[k0sh3k]] demonstrates for me? To a non-trivial extent, yes! April was a [[good]] person when I knew her (poor women are more likely to have the fitting empathy for [[others]], and she was empathic and her major was Religion,<<ref "p">> ofc), and I'm gonna bet she still is. There's an equal-yoke problem, and I think it helps that my wife is significantly older than me (she had lived 50% longer than I had when we got married). I think I'd still count myself honored to be her husband though.

I feel like I chose wise women. Perhaps it's just nostalgia or failed memories, but I am still fond of the vanishingly few people I've dated.

<<footnotes "a" "As we are all [[fff]], there is a sense in which none of us live up to an ideal standard I hold in high regard.">>

<<footnotes "g" "Hrm. Tracked her down. Fascinating to see she now works at our shared institution coordinating some of the very things we did together (couldn't have been the worst experience to think it worth going back to the same place to replicate it for [[others]] [or help them avoid making mistakes with fools like me :P]). I wonder if she still plays ping-pong. I'm sad to say, I have no idea how to bridge the gap between who I was then and who I am now for her. I assume she would be disappointed like anyone else.">>

<<footnotes "p" "Apparently, a necessary component of any woman that has interested me. In a sense, there is no way to interpret me without that background. If you've never felt or studied it before, if you had never experienced the social dynamics of such groups before, and if you hadn't had to wrestle with your [[faith]] hardcore: there's no way we could speak the same language.">>
