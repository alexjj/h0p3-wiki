!! Audit:

* The big "weekly summary" additions cometh.
** It is, of course, tiresome to read what I've written.
** I like sticking to 3rd person as much as I can. 
** I assume it will take us a while to get into the groove of this practice. Maybe it will change significantly. I hope it won't fade.
* We've moved to [[TTP]] dissection just for the offspring. It's already enough work as it is.
* It's wonderful to see this log grow from it's humble beginnings.
** I've done a good job of getting everyone in my family to participate, to appreciate we're doing here, and so forth. 
*** Sometimes it feels like I'm the one carrying the family in some stretches. Good. It's my honor.
* We've had to stick more rigidly to a [[Family Time.tmpl]] structure, eating our frogs first and so forth.
* My offspring now have to switch off between [[TTP]] sections so they can concentrate. 
** I have no idea if that will need to continue. I'm hoping, in time, our [[TTP]]s will settle down and/or people will be comfortable shaping them without so much effort (but, that isn't my prediction).
* I'm pleased with our work here. It's non-trivial.
