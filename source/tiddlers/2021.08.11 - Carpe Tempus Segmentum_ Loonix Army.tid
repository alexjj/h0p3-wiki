title: 2021.08.11 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Loonix Army

Woke at 12:30. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! Sketti leftovers + Chocolate coffee beans + water + Vapelyfe + LolVod while otherwise [[TTTOTW]].

She didn't sleep well because of the AC. So sensitive to noise, and she did her best to time. She did get enough though. I could hear it. I got a lot XOXOs. Talked to me about the fires she has to put out because of S (I've already forgotten the nickname), and his incompetence has launched her. She wants more task force work, particularly for policy. Invite-only, and the 2 of 3 leaders in charge of this have been picking her instead of people 1-3 levels higher than her. It's something to grow. SCOPA has been a resume line and a waste otherwise, it seems. PT today.

Hugs'n'bugs. Double-checked to make sure they were awake. My daughter is really not a morning person, though she tolerates her mother (the only person in meatspace, perhaps). Grumpkins. 

Speaking with [[anon]]s. Interesting encounters. It felt like islands to me.

Sleep by 10. Woke at 3. Meditation. AFireman Time! Took a shit. Cleaning. [[Morning Routine]]. Dinner prep. [[TTTOTW]]. Vapelyfe.

//The Walk// with my offspring was good. We hit the sto' for dranks, and saw Jessica (fine shawty), my son initiated a conversation with her. Seemed good. Card worked after cleaning. =). We rabbitholed hard today. My daughter didn't do her work, but we talked about her burnout. An indepth discussion in the problem of trying to bridge the knowledge gaps between her and her peergroup (very expensive trying to even articulate in an accessible way the facets of the concept of hospitality...[[FTO]] is an absurdly difficult place to read in some respects). Discussions of proofs and rhetoric. She's got her friends installing software to hand them data they need for hedonic pleasure and perhaps flourishing; may she raise the Loonix Army^^tm^^. My son explained the Punic wars (and the origins of the word, and wrestling with victors who write history). It was my turn to present, and we went after the [[power]] centralization problems of Keynesianism as it's playing out in the repo market. 

My offspring left trash to accumulate outside the bins. I saw a piece in the neighbors yard. Another discussion of Libertarian property rights, a bare minimum, what it means to respect the autonomy of an[[other]]. They may be baking their apology. 

Called [[JRE]] back.

Offspring came down to [[The Den]]. Finished explanation of what the repo market may be signaling to us. We continued a discussion of wealth structures and processes in the world. Son has 100 songs that can't be automated with the tooling he has. Still searching, but perhaps by hand. My daughter got it down to a one-liner for cronjob. They went up to finish dinner.

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! She came down to join me in reading celebration.<<ref "r">> 

[[Family Gathering]]. We had mole chicken tacos, corn tortillas, the standard veggies, lime, roja sauce, and fizzy water. I had 6. =D. Shit was crazy good. Didn't even touch the rice. My wife explained her day (and she had another meeting added). I get the feeling that everyone is feeling more pressure.<<ref "a">> [[TTTOTW]]. My interviewing process may be what she adopts, `/fingers-crossed`. //Skintime//. Begged her for the third time today to write her doctor. Being unable to lay down without pain like sucks. =(. She stayed to read while I fell asleep.

Sleep by 8?
