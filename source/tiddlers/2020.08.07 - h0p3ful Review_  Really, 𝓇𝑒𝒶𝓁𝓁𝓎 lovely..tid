//[[Notage Ti.68]] won't be getting a [[h0p3ful Review]], so I'll say it now: I appreciate that you prefer Linux. I do. Yes, you will need to channel hate for the bullshit, and you'll need to learn to wield it well too (justified hatred*). You must become someone who is able to make himself comfortable with any OS (and this turns out to be a harder problem than it looks at face value). I'm hoping that you will enjoy [[Emacs]] so much in the long-run that you won't accept anything else unless forced. You still must master bridging Windows and Linux as best you can, and there are many things you will appreciate about Windows (you are a noob at that OS: me too...we are just noobs period, dude). Roughly, the goal is to run your own machine on any machine as best you can. On some systems, it is an all-out prisonbreak.//

** Yup. I suggest drawing them in your 2-in-1. Learn to take digital math notes. Use paper in a pinch.
*** This is actually not an easy place for the mathematicians I've met. I'm not sure how to do what they might want either.
*[[2020.08.06 – Prompted Introspection: Mental disease]]
** Haha. I adore it. Thank you. It would be: Really, 𝓇𝑒𝒶𝓁𝓁𝓎 lovely.  
** I appreciate how you analyze mental disease. It is not an easy topic, and empathy is harder than most ever recognize.
*** Saw an economist from CMellon speak of some work on this topic. Fascinating.

** You will find most people disagree with you here, son. It is an important hard place in [[The Great Human Conversation]]. I think you will be disliked for your belief (while also being sometimes persecuted for a lack of conventional tact and rhetorical grace that you have inherited from an asshole like me). I'm sorry.

** [[2019.08.07 – Prompted Introspection: Hard one.]] is delightful. "This isn't important" Lol.
** [[2019.08.07 – Print Reading: Greed]] reminds me of the concept of the attractiveness of [[The Good]]
** The Hanlon's Razor claim in [[2019.08.07 – Conceptual Analysis: Fundamental Attribution Error]] is dope. 
** I appreciate that you've been workin' on computers with me for a while now, [[2018.08.07 -- To-Do-List Log]]. Thank you for planning with me.
** [[2018.08.07 -- Life Log]] is sad. I am [[grateful]] that you take the time to understand the people around you. It's incredibly expensive.
