title: 2022.09.04 - Family Log: Spending All Their Money On Oddvocadoes & Cardboard Housing

!! How has your health been this week?

* 1uxb0x
** It's been alright, though I've not been waking up early enough.
* j3d1h
** normal. wish i was sleeping better.
* k0sh3k
** New meds again! I have more hope for the +E. 
* h0p3
** Diurnal now. Feeling a bit better with the coolness. Lots of stress, and I've spent all my spoons into the red, so I'm holding on there.
* ASK
** I'm not doing awesome. Like the little mermaid, every step stabs like knives. Food is repulsive. I can't seem to stabilize my blood sugar. My head hurts. It has hurt pretty badly for the last few days. It is getting hard to read. I feel stupid. I miss the serotonin. Being able to simply decide that pain doesn't exist and having it be true was amazing. Suuuuuck.

!! What was interesting to you last week?

* DHTs, P2P tools, Cryptography, //House of Cards//, Walks, Logical Accounts, HB, //Metalocalypse//, 
* art, deltarune, and the corruption of the police force
* New work was neat.
* BTFO ended! 
* Work has been crazybusy - to be expected at the beginning of the semester. 
* I am LOVING classes. And Morning Prayer. And just being a student in general. 
** I'm sure the homework will get soul crushing soon, of course. 
** I got a new sword! It is cutlass shaped, so I am calling it a cutlass. Argue over the terminology if you want,  I'm the one with the swords.
