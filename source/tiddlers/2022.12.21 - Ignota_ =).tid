[07:07:20] Galaxian: i'm watching news right now
[07:07:44] h0p3: `/nod`. I spend a considerable amount of time trying to understand the news (I'm bad at it) as part of my grind.
[07:07:51] Galaxian: :)
[07:08:12] h0p3: What do you think of authors of the news you are consuming?
[07:08:15] Galaxian: did i tell you about my internet radio station?
[07:08:26] h0p3: You did, yes sir. I think that is a delight. 
[07:08:34] h0p3: Can probably get that to stream over i2p as well.
[07:08:41] Galaxian: sorry we are eating, i'm back soon
[07:08:45] h0p3: `/salute`.

[04:09:51] Galaxian: hi :)
[05:39:39] h0p3: Yo
[05:42:53] Galaxian: how are you?
[05:43:32] h0p3: Just got up. Gonna make coffee with mi amor after I push brix.

[11:08:49] Galaxian: hi dude :)
[11:33:34] h0p3: Hello, sir. =)
[11:33:48] Galaxian: how are you?
[11:34:14] h0p3: Hanging in there. Trying to be useful to folks. 
[11:34:35] h0p3: Reading something a friend wrote that is hard for me to understand. Thinkin' about it.
[11:34:56] Galaxian: i saw my belgian doctor, all is fine
[11:35:32] h0p3: How many doctors do you have?
[11:35:55] Galaxian: one french and one belgian, so 2
[11:36:33] h0p3: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Belgian_physicians
[11:37:07] h0p3: If you do make a page for them, should fill it with jokes and humor.
[11:37:18] Galaxian: lol ok :)
[11:47:31] Galaxian: i wonder if i keep my backups, after all my NAS has pro HDs
[11:47:45] Galaxian: what would you do?
[11:47:54] h0p3: You mean backups of your NAS?
[11:47:58] Galaxian: yes
[11:49:04] h0p3: If you have a friend who can hold an identical NAS that you SSH into and rsync over from time to time, that wouldn't be so bad. Could go much fancier on snapshots, but I prefer not to. I think having an offsite backup is reasonable if you can't replace the files.
[11:49:23] Galaxian: ok
[11:49:35] h0p3: You might also just separate what you can't replace from what you can, and only backup the files that can't be replaced.
[11:49:40] Galaxian: my friend doesn't have a NAS
[11:49:53] h0p3: I know the vast majority of my files can just be redownloaded and reorganized. 
[11:50:17] h0p3: Well, I mean, you'd probably need to front the hardware. He's already doing you a favor with the electricity and trusting you with a rooted system on his LAN.
[11:51:10] Galaxian: front the hardware? what do you mean?
[11:52:51] h0p3: I mean that you would pay for and assemble the hardware, have it all set up for him. He'd just be running your machine for you in, something like co-location. 
[11:53:28] Galaxian: NAS are too expensive, it's a miracle my mother let me buy it
[11:53:46] Galaxian: in france it's 25% more expensive than in USA
[11:54:20] h0p3: `/nod`. 
[11:54:34] h0p3: I'm glad you make good use of it.
[11:54:51] Galaxian: i have 20 years of tvshows to watch lol
[11:55:09] Galaxian: i have many thanks from retroshare users
[11:55:23] h0p3: Hard to find the shows worth our time.
[11:58:03] Galaxian: i think i won't backup ty movies in MULTI, i can get them back in 2 week over a RS channel
[12:08:53] Galaxian: my*
