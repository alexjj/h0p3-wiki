!! Starry Stack:

* Timeline
** Bountied, need timeline running like it was low level
** Needs multiple passes. Let's make it clean. 
*** We could ask for feedback. Happy to have philosophers attempt to destroy it.

!! Heap:

* Contacting/Interviewing Living Philosophers (Including Those Who Only Take Themselves To Be Aspiring Philosophers, or the most humble gods of philosophers who interpret all the others, at any level) 
** Do we attach the compressed wiki? Do we need to make this a completely separate project?
* Write it funny first, then strip out the things that make you giggle (all of them, idiot). 
** But, but...a philosopher that didn't understand the value of trying to do this for the world //deserves// to be trolled. Mmmm...delicious troll boggies, right off the wand. Right, daddy?
* Wikipedia wiki [[directory]] of verified philosophers (I, ofc, could be the only qualified judge).
* //Polling All Humans: Tell Me 10 Truths//
** //"Can you spare some truth for the poor? I am listening, teacher."//
** //"Ahhhhh....it burns. It's so bright it must be evil."//
** Hi, there. Please have pity on me. I'm your horrible, arrogant-philosopher-retard poser, hikikomori, neckbeard friend who annoys you. He also likes [[The Matrix]] way too much, so you know he's not worth your time. Hold on, let me apply more rhetorical clown makeup for you.
** Ask or tell me anything.
** I'm looking for [[what|W5H]] matters, of course.
** Pretend we face what may be the end of the world, and you're our only hope, Obiwan. I want to know what wisdom is worth living by and dying for.
** 10 bullet points, paragraphs, insults, quotes, stories, gnostic secrets, dank maymays, or mixture you want. 
** Draw a constellation if you need, picking a different audience for each answer.
** If all you can muster is to pick papers that tell the story for you, whether your own or someone else's (you sly dog, you). I'm also hoping someone can only come with 9 and sends me a dickpic instead (obv, I prefer the big horse cocks).
** Put your name on it, don't put your name on it: I don't care. I want to hear what you have to say.
** Say it technically, say it plainly, say it however you feel. Take a shit on it (and be anonymous or pseudonymous if you want).
** Burn it down if you must. Say it honestly, with every ounce you have.
** You have a one-time (though I do not claim we can't build an anonymous relationship) anonymity pass. It's yours, so keep it safe. I know how you losers use computers, and it scares me deep inside. 
** Take as much time as you need.
