title: 2022.06.10 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Beyond The Seemingly Inevitable

Finished brainstorming on LSpaces by 1:30? [[TTTOTW]]. Wrote up the critical talking points for mi amor's presentation. Fell asleep by 2? pwned.

Woke at 9. Spam phone call. The afterglow is still there. Body limp. Long meditation. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. It appears [[The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum]] showed up on [[DarkMX]]. Chats with [[Tzino]] and [[freedomemu]] as well. Assignments. Pushed brix to match the cat turds found near the sink in the basement. =(.

[[TTTOTW]]. LLC->EIN->Company Bank Account; At 50k net profit, shift to S-Corp holding company with a management fee. Legal dealing is another set of hoops. More measuring for the pantry downstairs. Think we're off by an inch.

//Party Down// + Grilled cheese with my sympaticon.

Offspring came down to grind. Pair programming with a retard tagging along to bounce ideas off. [[TTTOTW]]. Brings me joy to see my son dealing with Rust compiler errors to get the software he needs to complete the task. After many hours, sent them on a walk.

Ranga brought in a bird. I opened the doors and walked through them to show the bird. Didn't help. Found a wonderful perch and stayed there for a long time. Walked, waiting for mi amor (had to stay late for a meeting that ran late).

The Capitalist showed up. We moved it to the back. When he left, we moved it into position. I was wrong, it was off by 7cm. However, with some measuring and finagling, found that's exactly what we had left. 

//Raw Skintime// as she recounted her day. One of her new mottos: "we'll see." I cannot wait for the special archivist position (and the one below it) to be filled. They are missing about half their staff (most at the top too). She's all set on her presentations (a wildly ahead of the other panelists, who have basically ceded the primary speaking to her on most of the topics). Still some wrestling about [[2022.06.10 - /b/]]. Not a fun problem. //Inform the Men!//

[[TTTOTW]] + Yogurt + //Oblomov//.

Talk with [[5c0ut]] about his day. Doing good work on making the kitchen safe. His co-workers seem to appreciate it too. Will be going through the financials more closely. There's clearly a lot of cleaning up to do and optimizing. It's his jam. One of the owners doesn't want to use soap to wash dishes?...

Made a quick meal for folks. Watermelon and pizza (with anchovies for my son and me). 

Artgroup. Nearly as quiet as it gets, and largely unresponsive. Smooth sailing. The art of reading multiple screens, and I needs me a URL resolver like that one. [[TTTOTW]] + //Oblomov//. Wew. A pleasant surprise of an unpredicted message out of nowhere. Probably a first experience for me, I think. Cute on the couch, and the better pic, imho.
