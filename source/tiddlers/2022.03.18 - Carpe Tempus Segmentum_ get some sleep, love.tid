title: 2022.03.18 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: get some sleep, love

Woke at 1:15. Alcohol. `/nod`. [[TTTOTW]]. //Skintime// with my sympaticon as we watched //Mike Tyson Mysteries//, //Community// (I knew she'd like it), and a presentation on //ETF Short Interest and Failures-to-Deliver - Naked Short Selling or Operational Shorting// (and, it appears the concern has more merit to it now, as even my enemy, Wharton, picks out redflags here). Pushed brix. [[TTTOTW]] with my sympaticon curled up under my desk like a cat, but with a pillow and blanket.

She's up! Her morning is clearly off.<<ref "t">> Ugh. =(. Busy day ahead, and she's always nervous about tests (even when she's the best in the class). Gave space, came back right as she was driving out. Blew kisses. =). 

50mg of DCK for [[ASK]]. She set up two spots for the trip and then we screwed around in D2 to get her some practice and a level or two until it really hit. Also, she started feeling the effects almost immediately (I've noticed something similar with drugs I've tried many times). Almost a puke (which she came overprepared for), and she also had an anti-nausea pill (unfortunately, these are limited). I fell asleep, but she was set. She's gonna have to practice letting go so she can enter the k-hole (not sure if this is likely given what she has had to do as autistic person with PTSD over decades). 

Woke at 1:30? Fireman Time! Meditation. //Skintime// with my sympaticon. She's doing well. [[TTTOTW]].

Trio with [[ASK]] and [[1uxb0x]] through Arcane Sanctuary. I think we'll eventually have coordination. I'm not saying these people are horrific at the game (surely I was even worse), but I'm adjusting my predictions of what we will accomplish. I'm way, way, way, way more into this shit though, so I get it. `/nod`. We're having fun though. I'm all like: gogogogogogogo, and they lounge around reading. What kind of loser reads these days? <3.

[[TTTOTW]].

//The Walk// with mi amor. She has no work today or tomorrow (though she is teaching confirmation on Sunday, remotely), finally! Redtide (I failed to predict it, though I should have known from our dialectic :P), pain, no fuck, =(. Weather was absurdly good: I wore shorts (it may snow next week). The Plecker List. Apparently, where my wife is from in VA, her family was officially considered colored, and they dealt with plenty of racism (still do, in fact). We knew of why, but now things are clicking for extended family members.

Leftovers for scrounge. Corned beef + roasted veggies and potatoes + couscous and pea meal ftw. We watched garbage and chatted about nothings.

Family came down to [[The Den]] to play, though my was daughter off on her own game (glad she still came to chill). Everyone made level 1's to play with [[k0sh3k]]. People have been playing without ability hotkeys. There's only so much knowledge about dumbshit like [[D2]] that people can learn all at once. We can really feel the difference in our two playthroughs (crossoverable), as without a real tank, it was ugly. Nec is a great base upon which to build around (I used to think the pally was that). NeckRomancer is 21 with Hsaru's boots, Stealth, 28% Nagel's, and other 20+mf pieces (I'm communicating too much information for them to use it all well, unfortunately). 

//Skintime// with my sympaticon + //Community//. Sleep by 9:30?
