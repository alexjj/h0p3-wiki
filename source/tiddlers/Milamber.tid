12:08:27 AM [[Milamber]]: @h0p3 Milamber here 2nd attempt. Clean install from no O/S disk. Took all night to let me start install. Stable so far. Cheers.
09:29:33 AM [[h0p3]]: Dope. Glad to hear it's up and running. I think reinstalling many times is a rite of passage (and, sometimes, that's the best option, imho).
