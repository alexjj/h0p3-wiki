title: 2020.05.03 - Prompted Introspection: Saving

!! What are you saving up for?

[[2018.08.22 - Prompted Introspection: Saving]]...yup. That continues to be my answer. Saving is still pretty difficult at this point, but we are in a much better position than we were (despite the year that is 2020). We are saving other kinds of resources too. We've been building some arks and other tools for what may be tougher days ahead.

It's not all Maslow's Hierarchy savings though. There is a profound investment, a saving of our pleasures now for future pain-prevention and pleasures. We spend a lot of time saving up with each other, in each other, storing up what meaning we can find.
