title: 2021.03.29 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Itdo Kuh-thunk

//I dance tonight, kings.//

[[Scout]] came down to talk. Sent me his {[[Dreams]]}. Talked from the top of my head about it with him. Itdo Kuh-thunk! Lots to think about. My brother has quite a climb in front of him. His goals all make sense to me. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Chatted on 4chan, and a wild [[Mateo]] appears...<<ref "o">>

Chilled with my wife in the morning. At some level of hawtness, grumpiness is cute. I showered, then hit the sack. Slept hard, ruminated harder, Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Laying the smackdown today.

Hugs'n'bugs. Folks chilled on the couches. Our candy mold arrived, finally. Should make that soon. 

//Skintime//. Listened to her blather about truly unimportant things instead of focusing on me. It was terrible. =D. She's in better spirits today, but still grieving. 

//The Walk//. Poyfect. Called [[JRE]] back. He's doing the dishes, can hear the kiddos. Maintenance position test upcoming. Encouraging my son to torrent games, forgot that he bought my son a decent windows machine (explained why it was in storage), thinking about [[âˆ°]]. We found a basketball stuck in high in a set of bushes, clearly abandoned. She wouldn't let me get it. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Danced. Wrote down my non-sense. Have I told you how much I despise trying to understand Charles Williams? Impossible.

Cried and held my brother. He could sense my anxiety. He was showing his remodeling. It's gorgeous. Thoughtful. He could teach this, and it does something. Peasant's food with an art and science to it. I feel like I'm living in the Old Testament when I see what we are doing. Chillin'. 

My cursor moved. I'm not that high. Right? =D. Noice.

If so, remember you get a clean slate with me: that's a new identity.">>
