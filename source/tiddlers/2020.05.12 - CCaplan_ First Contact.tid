>>> Truly cool stuff. I love the interface. You are expressing in an introverted manner, what I try to express as extroversion. Same themes, though, clearly. I love the way you are looking at datasets of entries of personal diares in meta categories which are then essentially fed to a kind of master line of code which processes the order.. 

>>> Well done, sir. I'm sure not many appreciate what you do, considering the time investiment to really "get" you-- but I think I see what you're doing and it's clever AF. Of course, this might be somewhat narcissitic on my behalf, because I see such a parallel to the mirror, but even if I'm deluded by my own attempts, I am impressed by yours! Thank you for sharing, and I passed your link to u/papersheepdog You might look at his reddit profile and see if you might want to combine your resources.  I have a feeling, but nbd if you two don't connect. I hope you can make it to the live stream.
