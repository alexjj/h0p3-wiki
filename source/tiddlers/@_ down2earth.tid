there are no coincidences and the most unconventional circumstances led me to your project. I come from a different lens but I found the truth on my own journey and affording me the opportunity of gracing your mental maps I find alot of overlap with my truths and your own. I am very hopeful that we can benefit and learn lots more from eachother! [the universal hand pointed here] I embrace you as you are, and I empathize with your views, i hope you reciprocate the same courtesy to me as we begin to understand eachother even closer!
