To steadfastly believe we are either [[hope]]lessly cut off from reality through political signaling simulations, referencelessness, or from lacking any access to //The World//, including via metaphysics or to metaphysics itself, may be the root immorality of the skeptical position of the postmodern stance-condition. I'm always on the hunt with the anti-realists around me for the insidious reasons (self-selected or otherwise) with which they attempt to justify their attitudes, epistemic perspectives, and intentionality. The solipsistic representational theory is incorrect, despite it acting much like a self-fulfilling prophesy in practice. I find [[The Matrix]] authors' intentions ironically flawed here as well, and it makes me giggle to see Baudrilliard's hypocrisy play out in his flawed quasi-cassandrical diagnosis.

I lean toward the claim that forms of idealism exist in part because they have the potential to (and in fact actually do) enter into causal relations. It is not obvious that we are bound to apply the Nichtsein (non-being) of the Meinongian Jungle here, as though we noneistically should peel apart "there exists" from "some" in the existential quantifier (not opposed to existence as a property though, and I can appreciate noneism). But, I'm okay saying causality is just different (even contradictory) outside of time.

wonder if we will hit that point where the desperate need for energy will curtail our ability to even manufacture and maintain energy infrastructure

shadowbanning lovebomberbots swarming their targets with positive sentiment engagement only the target can see, these targets are drowning on a sinking prisoner's island of artificial affection (or using just enough negative feedback to pass turing tests and make it seem real to the apparent protaganist-syndrome sufferer) and addictive stimuli, where they don't even know when they are caught in augmented reality parasociality games, silencing them as they talk to their mirrioring digital wilson volleyballs with only a twinge of uncertainty while sinking deeper and deeper into their fantasy worlds...are we really supposed to be happy that they are happy?
