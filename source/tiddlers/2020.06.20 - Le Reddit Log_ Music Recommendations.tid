>> Thank you for this list (sorry I'm so late in responding, but yesterday was crazy busy). I appreciate your effort. Lots to think about in here.

>> //Spirit in the Sky// is one that I'm torn on. The instrumentals are killer (burned into my memory), but I can't stand the sound of the vocals (even though I know they go together). Maybe it's a song begging to be mixed to extract the instrumentals.

>> //Midnight in a Perfect World - DJ Shadow// is very pretty.

>> //Chicago - Sufjan Stevens// is playful. I can't put my finger on it, but it's warm and lifting.

>> Gracias!

>Interesting list, idk how knowledgeable you are in in the band's works other than what you have on there but I'll see if I can figure out something you'll like.

>[Going to California](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDIz4talyQk) and [Babe I'm Gonna Leave You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyOg0mt2R2k) by Led Zepplin based on Stairway to Heaven

>Based on some of the harder rock songs in the list try [Gimme Shelter - The Rolling Stones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbmS3tQJ7Os) or [Spirit in the Sky - Norman Greenbaum](https://youtu.be/xi_3GtQN2IA)

>Based on the electro swing try more of Parov Stellar's work like [All Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_C7UgR_sIW0) and [Booty Swing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eco4z98nIQY)

>[Midnight in a Perfect World - DJ Shadow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InFbBlpDTfQ)

>This isn't really based on you're list but Beach Boy's stuff like [Good Vibrations ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ-UFKxDq5o)basically use the voice as just another instrument. 

>Other Kanye West songs than No Church in the Wild such as [Power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8JflBNovLE), [Jesus Walks](https://youtu.be/MYF7H_fpc-g) and [Bring Me Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ_-O31R3p4)

>[Chicago - Sufjan Stevens](https://youtu.be/c_-cUdmdWgU) is another with killer instrumentation you might like.

>Tell me if any of these hit the mark, I'm sure I could come up with plenty more if so.

<br>

>>>>> Same some bands I'll listen to a few times before I get why but some o just instantly pick why like [between the buried and me](https://youtu.be/oipeeZs65EI)

>>>> I've not had enough practice to know how to pick out why they sound special to me even if I can give them some broad descriptors.

>>>What do you mean untrained ear and yes Tillian has special sounds they use a electric cello

>>>as for powerwolf it's what it is just some amazing power metal with tons of medieval and fantasy creatures and some religious hyms in

>> Trillian's Black Holes and POWERWOLF's Amen & Attack have special sounds (can't put my finger on it) to them for my untrained ears. Thank you! I'm grateful for your recommendations.

> You might enjoy the bands [rhapsody](https://youtu.be/eU2GcuAm6EI) & [mahavishnu orchestra](https://youtu.be/gv_bkS5VVaA) & [Tillian](https://youtu.be/ZUAohx8UNAw) & [פנחס ובניו](https://youtu.be/dwMsmlJXAQA) & [Uriah heep](https://youtu.be/gZjZtJ_Cl94) & [powerwolf](https://youtu.be/KmqgRAXygDg) & [scardust](https://youtu.be/NApZQD8hLgU) & [deep purple](https://youtu.be/Wr9ie2J2690)

<br>

>>> Absolutely! Thanks for checking them out!

>> It's definitely interesting, and I'm grateful for your recommendations. I'm especially taken by the //Explosions in the Sky//. Thank you!

>Since you said you have trouble with lyrics, maybe check out the following instrumental bands: 
>
>[Explosions in the Sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ziw4yd5R0QI) [Post-Rock]
>
>[Savestate Corrupted](https://savestatecorrupted.bandcamp.com/) [Videogame Rock]
>
>[Anamanaguchi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc3JWo2iiGc) [Chiptune Rock]

>
>[Polyphia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tv7Hyz4hqm0) [Progressive Rock]
>
>I hope this is interesting in the least!

<br>

>> Delightful! Thank you.

> I noticed you're into some synthwave-outrun type styles with the perturbator and laserhawk, maybe you'll enjoy something off [Voyager by Sequencer](https://open.spotify.com/track/3hR4yqLfUucJdpxq2WRih2?si=88a3lYSPQtWn05H_PTv76w). It's a cinematic take on similar sounds, I'll let you make your own choice for what to add but it's a pretty consistent album

<br>

>>>I'm glad you liked it, honestly just you telling me what you thought is thanks enough, I really appreciate when people take the time to do that because then I know that the time I spent writing my comment was worth something to somebody.

>>That Evanescence version is wonderfully dramatic. Thank you!
>>
>>I wish I could follow more musicians; I didn't even know Tool made new albums. Wow! Tool album is on 𝕱𝕴𝕽𝕰. Thank you for pointing me to it.
>>
>>You weren't shittin' me about Jinjer's vocalist either. That oscillation between her soft and aggressive voices is outstanding.
>>
>>I wish I knew how to thank you for taking the time to send me links to what is salient in the world of music. Gracias.

>I noticed you had Lacrimosa on the list, have you heard [Evanescence's version](https://youtu.be/1yyJG9uIm_M)? It's not really a cover, it's a completely unique song and a different genre, but the melody is based on the original.
>
>If you care more about the sound of the music I would recommend [Tool's  newest album](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3htOwmtQv_yHPXNRHNJ-naKnAsvOuclt). Its focus is to build a soundscape around you and convey emotions and experiences through sound, rather than building on lyrical concepts. Most songs will be built by saying "ok, we have angry lyrics so we need the instruments to sound aggressive and angry. It doesn't matter what they're doing as long as they sound angry"  In those cases you could replace the music with any other angry music and it would have the same effect, but this album goes the other way. In this album the band is speaking through the music, the way the instruments interact with one another is what tells the story and the lyrics are just there to match the story. In that sense it conveys ideas much the same way that classical music does. I was never a huge fan of Tool, but this album is phenomenal.

>For me personally I have been listening to a lot of Jinjer lately. Idk how much you would like them as I didn't see a whole lot of heavy metal on your list, these guys are fairly aggressive. I feel like their music just sounds so good, all the instruments work well together, the music in complex and interesting and their vocalist is unreal. If you want to get into them [Pisces](https://youtu.be/SQNtGoM3FVU) is a pretty common starting point.

<br>

>>>> Thank you for the recommendations. I appreciate it. Little by little is my favorite of them! Thank you. =)

>>> Ok In that case let me throw a few album suggestions ur way:

>>>Enchanted by naux faux (it's a collab between bassnectar and sayer, 2 super talented dudes)

>>>Little by little by lane 8 (for my money hes the best deep house producer in the game right now)

>>>Ecozoic by the polish ambassador (he makes all kinds of different stuff but I really like this album)

>> It does load on a phone (eventually), but I've not built my site to be mobile friendly (that might sound odd, but there are good reasons for it). The site is really meant for a desktop or laptop (or an extremely nice tablet).

>>I adore electronic music!

> So for some reason my phone was having trouble loading the link but I am wondering, do you listen to electronic music at all? That stuff is 100% all about the sound man. Don't get me wrong there are some truly beautiful lyrical elecctronic songs out there and a lot of good ones that involve rap or some other kind of lyrics but 1st and foremost it's about the beat the vibes the drums all of that good stuff

> If I can get the link to work I could suggest some stuff that is similar to what you already listen to Maybe? But I don't wanna make a bunch of suggestions if electronic music isn't your thing I would suggest you keep an open mind to it though because its an extremely diverse genre

Everyone has their own tastes in music and methods for finding it, which is a great thing. I keep a list of my favorite music (when I'm not exploring, I simply listen to this list), and I'm hunting for stellar songs that people think might fit it (maybe that sounds crazy, I don't know what to say).

Please give it a bit to load (the entire site is loaded into memory): https://philosopher.life/#Music%3A%20Library

I'm autistic, and I have an auditory processing disorder that makes it hard for me to hear lyrics (similar to my colorblindness). The sound of music is what I like most about it. Please don't hesitate to make a recommendation. I don't know if I'll have anything you'd like, but you might find something interesting too.
