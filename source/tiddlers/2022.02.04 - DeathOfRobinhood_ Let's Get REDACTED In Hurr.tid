title: 2022.02.04 - DeathOfRobinhood: Let's Get REDACTED In Hurr

"""
Hey, have a few minutes tonight?
I crashed early last night. Sorry.
Hey [[DeathOfRobinhood]], I'm free to talk. No rush*.
Hey, sorry I saw this so late
yo =)
Nothing to be sorry for. You are dad with a very young child. Lol.
I had three encounters with others today. I'm not sure I have much of value left to offer.
I'm happy to have you live on the other end!
I was thinking maybe I should write you a letter instead. It would give me time to think about what my actual question is.
Either or both. I am fan of writing :P. It gives me a chance to think.
You been grinding hard?
Dear Abby
Lol
Not really. I've been kind of lazy lately
Noice.
I'm trying not to goof off too much
How about you?
Plenty of grinding is a goofing off of sorts. I have the opportunity to review a lot of memes, hehe.
So, it's a nice mix for me.
I have been pushing hard.
My goofing off involves enjoying the memes you review
Lol
Although many of them are more sobering than anything so I don't know if it's 'enjoyable'
Many are beautiful
Yeah, it's a mix. I'm tending to keep the ones that give me strong feelings, even if I don't agree with or like it.
The beautiful ones are comforting.
Have you ever seen photos of the city of Norilsk?
I think so.
Lookin' now.
I have a hard time remembering what I've seen.
Had a haunting apocalyptic feel that sort of fits your vibe sometimes
Yeah. I see that!
You ever tell [[k0sh3k]] something about yourself and she's surprised?
Yeah. That still happens. It's not as common or as complete as it used to be.
Surprises come in degrees and kind. There are surprises still even in the small things too.
How surprised?
Two kinds I'm thinking. Surprised that you think/feel that way. Surprised this thing happened to you/you did this thing.
Yeah, I think we both encounter both of those for each other.
Do you know when you're going to surprise her?
People change too, so I think that's something that adds uncertainty.
Sometimes I know.
Sometimes I think it's about a series of things that add up, and we come to a realization of a larger pattern that we didn't notice before.
There's part of me she doesn't understand either, so when that can be a source of surprises.
I'm reflecting on a larger pattern I've noticed in Selah and myself.
Old stories that we've never heard before are also sources.
Oh, what's that?
I should like to pay more attention to people in general. I like being surprised.
Um, with Selah. It's maybe a bit intimate. [[REDACTED]]. I'm having a hard time finding a name for it besides reaching for a just-so on the spectrum answer.
Its adorable. And it's def an unfolding pattern from day one.
For myself. I'm realizing maybe I am susceptible [[REDACTED]].
I am surprised by that. I can see you taking risks others would not, and enjoying it too. I'd be surprised to see you [[REDACTED]].
There's also a space for [[REDACTED]], in small amounts, for either the experience or exploring options we otherwise wouldn't.
[[REDACTED]]
I wouldn't be surprised if Selah weren't neurotypical given her brother and her patience and empathy in her vocation.*
You [[REDACTED]], you. XD.
I've [[REDACTED]]...
And ate up all of my [[REDACTED]]
For [[REDACTED]]
And [[REDACTED]]
Nested speculation
I think largely fueled by my vanity
You and I disagree on your vanity. I don't think you're vain.
I want to appear to be a smart person who made [[REDACTED]] unconventionally
I was making good [[REDACTED]] too
That's appreciable. It can be difficult to [[REDACTED]] without being unconventional in a lot of cases. We all want to be smarter too.
Until [[REDACTED]]
Then I [[REDACTED]]...
I can make arguments against [[REDACTED]], if that's what you're looking for. I will agree that it is [[REDACTED]].
I don't even know what attracted me. I wasn't looking. A stranger on a friend's discord mentioned the thing and I looked it up and I was hooked
One way to dispel it for ya might be to look at the underlying [[REDACTED]] of these objects, and you may find them less motivating.
They're dressed up in superficially nostalgic graphics
[[REDACTED]]. Very enticing.
I would like you to exorcise me. Maybe we can try to talk another day?
Lol. I am happy to speak about [[REDACTED]]. I think you'll change your mind about them.
Another day*
Im happy that you haven't been figured out by [[k0sh3k]] yet :)
The trick is to being so disgusting a creature, she wouldn't want to figure it out. Not enough eye bleach in the world.
I've been trying, but she keeps kissing my flab
lol
See you! I hope you find something you need tonight.
Love you. Sleep well. TTYL.
