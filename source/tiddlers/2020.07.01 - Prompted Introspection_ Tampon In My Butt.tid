title: 2020.07.01 - Prompted Introspection: Tampon In My Butt

!! What is an event that you will never forget from your school days?

[[2019.05.29 - Prompted Introspection: Spray Paint]] is sad. Okay, let me think of a happy one now. Alright, back to the 6th grade for a massive fieldtrip. We traveled through my future hometown in E-town to get to my older hometown in Louisville to hit the science museum; most of the kids had never traveled outside a 20-mile radius of Mannsville (and, I didn't know it at the time). I played suck'n'blow on the bus, learned some amazing parody lyrics to the Barney song, listened to the lumberjack's son speak about birchwood and incest, then I played in the museum (my offspring have been to that one a couple times now), and I had tunafish sandwiches with onions and relish (I remember preparing that lunch). Neat. A decade later, I would drive past that rest stop where I ate those sandwiches on my commute. 

I remember leaving on the bus early, before school would normally start (took hours to get there). I remember my bully Brandon Cox (bless his heart) going through my friend Caren Cox's purse to play with her tampons and make fun of her bleeding. My god, Mrs. Richardson and Mrs. Woods kept us late after arriving, and they were filled with pure fury. Screaming at Brandon (he was the boy who taught me that the words "cock" and "pecker" referred to a penis) and then every boy in the room (because we were boys), they handed each of us a tampon and threatened to force us to pull down our breeches and drawers to shove them up our butts. I reckon that was when I decided they didn't mean it because that just didn't seem like something they would do. 

Anyway, I will forever remember holding onto this tampon wondering about what it would feel like in my butt. Happy, happy; joy, joy.
