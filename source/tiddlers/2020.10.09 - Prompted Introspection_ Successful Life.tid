title: 2020.10.09 - Prompted Introspection: Successful Life

!! Why do you think some people are successful in life and others are not?

Eudaimonia is in no small part a matter of [[Moral Luck]]. So much of what we think consists in success is reducible to birth lottery, genetics, conditioning, and environmental variables outside our direct or immediate control. It's why [[The Right]] is the only standard by which we can judge the merit of a person as a person. Most philosophers don't seem to think universalism and contextualism can be woven together, but we must. Success that merits our respect (which is much slimmer and more difficult to pick out than most people are willing to recognize) is a matter of doing our best toward what matters most with what what we have. For some people on some days, getting out of bed is universal success in their context. The manner in which egoism orders society through Capitalism includes an alienating memeplex, an ideology, that defines success in terms of how it serves the interests of the most selfish human specimens. Obviously, success has to be measured not just on an individual scale. I wish I had a better answer for you, Samwise. I'm spinnin' my wheels, as usual.
