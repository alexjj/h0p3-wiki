Didn't realize what was happening, thought maybe you were obfuscating your face to avoid facial ID or something

Lol. That is hilarious. I've never seen that image before. Didn't even occur to me that my face would be smushed by that button.

That one is for [[k0sh3k]] and several people who hate my font (understandably).

When you get the chance, I would like to see what it looks like as a screenshot. I have to emulate it on my machine, but I never actually get to see the real thing in most cases. I am thinking about how to make my wiki more ergonomic for everyone (though I'm bad at it).

I used to watch a series of videos of a guy in Lexington that would set up a booth and practice this.  Would engage with people on whatever subject they chose and ask about what lead them to that belief.  Very calm, kind dude.
