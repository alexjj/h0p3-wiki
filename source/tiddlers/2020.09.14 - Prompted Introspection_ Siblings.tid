title: 2020.09.14 - Prompted Introspection: Siblings

!! If you had been able to choose, would you rather have been an only child or part of a very large family?

Let us set aside the question of my donors. I don't know what consists in a "very large" family. Only children may have better lifetime outcomes on average. I think being a first-born has some similar characteristics to being an only child, and there are good and bad aspects to this (birth order in the very large family may be valuable to consider). I want [[AIR]] and [[JRE]] and [[L]] and [[K]] in my life. If I get to keep them, I'd choose not to be an only child in a heartbeat.

It's interesting hearing Rebecca compare the three brothers with her relationships with her siblings. We all have our ups and downs, but it seems very different. We are lucky to have people who have known us for so long: to have mountains of shared experience, feelings, thoughts, and stories interdefining and shaping us together. Yes, only-children will tend to have, on average, as many close friends as those who have siblings. I don't think there's a replacement for siblings though. We are now in metaethical perfectionist territory in defining eudaimonia, and this is my best guess.
