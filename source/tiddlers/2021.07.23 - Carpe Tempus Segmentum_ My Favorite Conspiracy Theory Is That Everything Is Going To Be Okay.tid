title: 2021.07.23 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: My Favorite Conspiracy Theory Is That Everything Is Going To Be Okay

[[TTTOTW]]. No idea what time I fell asleep.

Woke at 9. Meditation. Fireman Time! 

Hugs'n'bugs. Folks were good. Son is still working on getting copies of everything we need. Worried that Delta variant may close the border again, but `/fingers-crossed`. They are getting their shit done. 

[[TTTOTW]]. 

[[JRE]] called me up! He's workin a preventive maintenance job in a rich neighborhood (their shit stinks too). Kids getting hit with Roseola, [[Q]] has a ridiculous fever. They have a whiteboard tracking fever-medicine rotation, able to get him to a doctor, and doctor, of course, said they were doing everything right ([[Rb]] always does it right; that girl is fucking on top of it, Hundo). Leelo scratched, and [[Rb]] had a sane (and emotionally expensive) reaction-approach. Oh, broski clipped a mirror, lulz (regular wear and tear on the job), and he's being thoughtful about his emotions too. My bro is worried he's spending too much time trying to understand each site. He would know better than me, but, I think it's a good thing that he does. Training himself to interpret on-the-fly. I could only imagine that long-term it pays off. Dielectric and dirty power explanations (my brother's explaining stuff way out of my league). He's tired, but gettin' shit done. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Fell into depression sleep. Could not even can. Cool story. Woke at god knows. Saw senpai [[chameleon]]'s message. I wasn't too late! 

[[chameleon]] called me up! She's in good spirits. I think she's been quite busy. Thought about translations and some of her graphical work. Talked about Christianity across the world. Living in different cultures. Her job is going well, not too high pressure. She pushed her wiki, might cronjob it. Cubedraft request for [[Magnus]]. She's hitting FNM tonight. [[Hope]] she wins.

Two people, [[5c0ut]] & [[k0sh3k]], came down to see me during the conversation (I feel bad turning anyone away, but phone call!). I joined them upstairs. Adults chillaxin in the living room. I think we're the only ones who use it. Our commons area is often barren at this point (though not too messy). [[5c0ut]]'s not in the mood for another relationship at the moment, and I think that will change in time (give a while, eh?). 

//Skintime//. Never enough. Literally. I'm so fucking horny. Her period sucks. It's not the redwings she has a problem with: it's the goddamn headaches and cramps. They hit her so hard (and I'm the one who's supposed to be doing that!). She's surviving and you can tell it's taking plenty of spoons to do it. Fireman Time!

[[Family Gathering]] sans [[5c0ut]] (think he was sleeping). We had pierogies, pizza, waffle fries, salad, water, and I had two cocktails (very fancy ones, swear to ya...one had vodka+gin+vermouth+lime, the other vodka+triplesec+strawberryliquer+lime<<ref "l">>). We [[paused]] a bajillion times through //Temple of Doom//.<<ref "n">> A flash! My heart skipped beats for ten seconds. We had a lot to think and talk about (politics, religion, hauntology, racism, jingo, our own upbringings, etc.). Also, my daughter's claim was: "You have to touch the titties to push it in. First of all, shut up." Lmao. XD. [[k0sh3k]] was having a good time despite being in pain. //Skintime//. She hates my bed, but it brings us //so// close together, qua jabba.

Put that girl to bed. She toast. Too worried about trying to squeeze so much out of tomorrow. She need a break. Handsy.

[[TTTOTW]].

<<footnotes "n" "Now, I know, I know, I know, stfu, losers, this wasn't how I presented it to them the first or second time either. We're out of the chronology. it's okay. Hold your shit in plz. We still enjoyed it.">>
