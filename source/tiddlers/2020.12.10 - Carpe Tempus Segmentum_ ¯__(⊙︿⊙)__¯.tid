title: 2020.12.10 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: ¯\_(⊙︿⊙)_/¯

I have a new rule in my house: books will have a single caretaker. I'm done with a physical family library. That's bullshit.

* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
* Hotdogs. Lengths of meat on the brain.
* Read+Write+//GoT//
* Sleep by 6:30
* Woke at 1
* Someone came to the door but left before I got there. ¯\_(⊙︿⊙)_/¯
* Fireman Time!
* Hotdogs (in the mood, I guess)
* [[MTG]] with son before we pushed.
** MUC +2 vs Affinity: don't remember how I won.
*** Daughter is suspicious of me giving them the decks to own (clever girl, always).<<ref "x">> Suggesting how they might continue construction. Assigning more ~~homework~~ fun things to do, of course. 
* Unpacking
** Fixing furniture up.
** Wife's room is in better shape. Now there's just a giant pile in one corner instead of the entire floor. It's been well-planned though. Two sets of shelves stacked well, bed in place, and we're ready for the wardrobe, desk, and reading nook. We aren't wasting space at all. I like this one much better than any room she's ever had. 
*** It is likely the case that however I set it up is what she'll keep for a long time. She's not the sort to change it. I just want it to be super easy for her. 
**** She needs surfaces to unload her junk onto. That's how she operates. I've argued for a large table-desk for her (and I'm setting up the shelving to maximize it). We'll see.
*** Most of the books will be in her room, closet devoted to her ark, and she's going to have extra space (I know she'll fill it like a hoarder, ofc). I've decided it will be her office too. Space works out, quietness and control do too, and it will be warmer than the sunroom-thing. 
*** Curtains installed, had offspring help me on the second (since they will do their own). 
** Bathroom continues to increment. Curtains up there too.
*** Was going to have my son install a shelf above the toilet, but perhaps we should aim for a stand instead. There's just so little space, we need to make use of all vertical space (and I should find a way to make use of shower space too).
**** It's my only major complaint about the design of the house thus far.
** Set up son's room with offspring. 
*** I'm [[grateful]] that my daughter brought her magic to help him. She was efficient enough that I only had to work on the big things.
*** His idea is to use his bunk-desk back as a wall to create a large space of privacy. It's odd, but it works. Given the doors, I think it makes extra good sense. 
**** Offspring asked for a tour of my reasoning about each bedroom in the house, so that's what we did.
*** I need to weld his ladder. Until then, the step-stool works well enough. Mat will hold it for now. 
* [[Morning Routine]]
** At 7, I realize, lol.
* //Skintime//
** Her day was been ridiculously productive. 
*** Interesting to see she's aiming to publish in her elite niche journal and will be a peer reviewer (incest). My bet is she's just free labor here, but you know what I think of the signaling processes in academia. 
** Thought about her room. Made a small spot for me. I get up so fucking much during the night, sleep at odd hours, etc. Seems like I'll have more of a chance though. Been a couple years where I've had to protect her sleep at all costs, but that may be changing. Dope.
** I'm disappointed with my progress in her room, but she wasn't. She cuts me a lot of slack. 
* Inform the Men!
* Meditation
* Shower of the gods!
** First time with us together here (may it be many!). I miss the square shower, but primarily because it forces us to be closer. I just want to be in the shower with a naked woman as close as possible for as long as possible. 
** I don't trust my wife's dexterity/agility. We need to find a showermat to ensure her safety. I want one that will stay clean or be consistently easy to clean.
** I don't smell like mustard. That's a good start.
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Asha noodles, egg, kimchi, screw driver, and all the beer in the house. Drunk AF.
** [[MTG]]: offspring and I talked and played for hours. It was dope. Lots of learning about lots of shit.
*** Son's MUC +1 vs Affinity: Shows me a hand he wanted to mull with 3 spikes, land, impulse, and more...what? Anyway, I committed a rules violation with clamp (drunk AF) and judged a loss for myself. GG.
*** Son MUC +2 vs Affinity: Just whittle, he plays well (can't draw out his permission), get him to 1 after blocks, topped shackles stabilizes right before loss, and scoop. 
*** Son's MUC vs D&T +1: Revoker + Vial + 3x Relic-Warders, GG. 
*** Son's MUC +1 vs Belcher: Wants to ditch a hand with spikes, and I convince him not to. Surely, I'm here to win. 10 straight counters on mana sources. He eventually draws Forbid, flashes it to me with his stupidface grin, and it was over. Bastard. =)
*** Son' MUC vs MG Forest Ramp +2: Wish for Evacuation would have been a loss. Chord of Calling on my own end step in response to tap out brought out Titan. All 22 Forests in play, he tapped wrong, and I Rude Awakening. They made me draw a penis on one of the forests to match Affinity's Ornithopter's Big Dick. 
**** Among our 10k conversations, we thought about why penises are shaped as they are.
* Read+Write

Trying to move offspring back onto school sleeping schedule. They still have plenty to do in the next week and a half before winter vacation. I hope we can whip the house into shape fast enough for everyone to do as they please (and, I hope I'll be able to get a fuckton of wiki work done).

Thinking about how more may move in with us here soon enough. Shit continues to hit the fan. I want to it to be easy to absorb more family, low-friction, enjoyable even.
