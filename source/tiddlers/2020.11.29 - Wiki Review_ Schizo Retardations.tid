title: 2020.11.29 - Wiki Review: Schizo Retardations

* [[2020.11.28 - Prompted Introspection: Baked Beans]]
** I am glad that my offspring know I'm an ape. Even as a differentiationist forced on the teleosemantic stage, it is a lesson that I wish I learned earlier than I did.

** And, indeed, that plunge is happening for the adults. If we are moving asap and compressed, it will be happening for my offspring too. I will be commandeering their time.

** Feels like my brother [[JRE]] has been calling me more. Dope.
*** Additionally, I can tell he's looked at the [[Link Log]]s with his [[JRE]] greentag links. Also dope.
** I have been absolutely binging //GoT//. The show goes downhill after Joffrey's death though. I'll probably slow down at this point. 
** Glad we stocked up. We still have the arks. May they be unnecessary schizo retardations.
*** I am surprised I have not heard from [[saya]].
*** We've run out of produce, and I wanted to go shopping for that at Aldi, but we might be moving immediately instead.
