title: 2021.08.02 - Prompted Introspection: Getting Along

!! What kind of people do you get along best with?

It's a question I keep asking myself decade after decade. There are simply too many vectors to consider here. It depends on what you mean by "get along," Samwise. 

I can be cordial, polite, [[civil|civility]], interesting, and useful to most people to at least some small degree. If I'm not revealing my autistic power levels, cutting loose, saying what I'm thinking without my social filtration, and pursuing what I think matters (especially insofar as it is contrary to another's perspective, and this is quite often), then I can code my way through many encounters with other neurotribes and perspectives. I can sit quietly with many people, and I agree to the moral permissibility (if not obligation) of enough social norms (especially surrounding silence) in most cultures I've found myself in (which may be in the trillions, as crazy as that sounds...very hard pomo Spheres of Justice problematic to disentangle) in that I can usually refrain from stirring pots and pissing people off for at least small encounters (though, sometimes I just rub people the wrong way from the beginning; they hate my face :P). Long-term [[intimacy]] and community-building is another matter entirely.

If I [[share]] an enormous overlap with someone's interests (with similar intensity), we can get along if we only talk about those interests about 70% of the time (eventually, those interests point to what I think takes priority, and it's the same conversation as I'm having with everyone, ~~Pinky~~ Samwise, yet again). 

Philosophical realists^^tm^^ who take metaphysics seriously, who like to read, who maintain some humbly fluid stances and positions without devolving into relativism, who aren't reactionaries or capitalists, and who appreciate [[computing]] have some of the basics in common with me. If they grew up poor or persecuted, it improves our odds. Autists and schizos are far, far more likely to get along with me (it might be one of the key factors). Queer folk, especially hyper/pan-ish or greyish leanings, who are more likely to be proficient in maintaining Platonic^^tm^^ relationships to survive have lots of emotional material in common with me. There's a lot of factors in the end. 

I'm an odd, disgusting, and highly confrontational character in many people's lives (that's apparently my lot and my role), and so it takes quite a bit of tolerance to deal with me (especially in high frequency). That's pretty obvious with my [[Root Users]] (who have all been generous teachers to me). All of them are highly tolerant human beings. I'm an expensive person to maintain a relationship with (though I attempt to minimize that in many respects). Someone who isn't willing to [[wrestle]] with me simply can't get along well, deeply, and directly with me in the end, but I work to maintain [[intimacy]] even when it must be radically passive. People who are willing to listen will find me fanatically listening to them, [[WINTCIS]].

Even this ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî± is built so that if my [[donors]] wished to get along, they could. ''That'' is [[love]]. I [[hope]] to continue to build the bridge to all until I die. I predict failure, but I am [[grateful]] for having the people in my life that I do. These past few years have been expensive and worthy.
