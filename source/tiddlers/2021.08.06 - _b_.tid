Denouncing all fixed ideas, external structures, and rules systems as dogmatic spooks while embracing any internal drives ultimately has no more merit than embracing an arbitrary ethos that cultivates psychopathy (claiming to be the exception to The Moral Law) of its adherents. It's such a deeply personal decision, I know.

I legit want to visit a strip brothel bookstore. Take it to the nines and elevens and second breakfasts, please. Hello, Red Riding Hood! Into the thick of it, I want to tramp through your bush, where we push. Show me your junkgle, girl. You taste like pussy and paper.

`#`adulting: You know you're getting older when you look at a food and imagine the shits you'll have afterward, weighing it, considering whether or not you can afford to lose that much sleep, stomach lining, and your ability to sit in front of your computer all day.

Heroes are disposable after we've ground them down to their dollar value (let's throw a pizza party). We just spend our lives moving stuff around.

Of course we should cut people slack and even praise them (ourselves included!) who change their minds with //fitting// justification. That doesn't mean there shouldn't be consequences that include a post-mortem of their epistemology. In particular, when you become too reliant upon other people doing your epistemic work for you, especially when you demand they provide the cited argument in full logical form with recursive subproofs rather than showing which direction to consider, and if you are proven wrong again and again, it becomes your responsibility to rethink your epistemology more generally in payment as part of the thank-apology. There still may be a place for having a portion of our population engaged in this "lazy" practice, but often I find it a misdirective mask of someone who wasn't interested in what mattered in the first place.

A corporation cannot have an intention, but, insofar as you cannot reduce or surmise individual responsibility, you must hold the corporation accountable for the consequences. A lot of the world would implode, that don't make it wrong.

Unfortunately, it feels (though I do not claim these peel apart) I often find myself working to be blameless rather than being able to solve the problem (which has a recursive blame problem itself). It feels as though some problems are so big or not up to me, it's the only rational choice available.

Capitalism converts many disciplines into degenerating research programmes. Unfortunately, the same can be said of many reactions to it.
