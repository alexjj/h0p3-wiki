Darling, I've realized I don't love you.
If I loved anyone, it would be you. But I love no one.
I've come to understand I don't care about anything except for myself.
Any kindness I've shown has been in my own self-interest.
The very existence of other people seems doubtful.
I wanted more from life than this.
Let's have a baby.

Enter the first door. There are orange sliced and water here.
Remove your clothes.

The second door is an airlock. Now you are in The Emotion Room.
Now you are free to release your emotions.

If these false and toxic substances are kept inside you, they will act as a poison.
They are black and stinking. They glisten like oil slicks.

If you need to cry, ejaculate, or void your bowels as well, you may do so.
When you are done, warm scented water will spray down your body.

The emotions will be washed through holes in the floor. 
They will be neutralized with an industrial strength bleach solution.

Exit The Emotion Room. Dry and dress yourself. 
Eat the orange slices. Drink the water.

Did you want to see the statue?
Flashback.

I commissioned a famous sculpter to carve it, from France.
Belgium.

Oh - hahaha - it's not of me!
It's of my Best Self.

Can you make her smarter, kind of ivy-league?
But real nice too - a little "Doctors-Without-Borders" even.
With a sharp sense of humor, but not, like, dickish.

I used to be so unhappy, but then I got on Prozac
I used to be so unhappy, but then I took up meditation
I used to be so unhappy, but then I had a baby
I used to be so unhappy, but then I tried yoga

I have a good job, I have my health, I have a husband and children I love.
But it comes anyway. And I see how cruel and ugly life is, and I feel like a scab of blood, like a dirty puddle in the street.
I look into other people's eyes and that same thin nothingness looks back and we can't reach out to each other.
And it gets louder, and darker, and heavier, and it pushes down on me, and it hurts.

Don't lose hope.
I know how you feel. I know life can seem black sometimes.
But not since I went gluten free.
Gluten free?
It turns out my depression really was a form of wheat allergy.

The fox must have been hit pretty recently- 
it didn't smell and when Maggie moved it: 
blood trickled out of its nose.

She cut behind the tendons of both feet and threaded rope through.
They had skinned rabbits and deer before.

First Maggie cut rings around each foot, down the backs of the legs, and around the vent.
He smelled, strong now, up close, but it was the stink of his glands, not rot or bowels.

They peeled away the skin on the legs, showing dark red, glistening muscle.
There was an ugly crotch that was hard to look at.

But the clean fat leg muscles weren't hard to look at all.
You can tell they'd be good to eat.

Laura skinned as far up the tail as she could & then cut it between the bones.
Lacey cut gently down the belly, which was green and taut and mottled.

Fox skin is attached more strongly than rabbit or deer skin, apparently, and in pulling it off:
Spang!
...the muscles around the rear right leg, which had been broken, snapped.

Without his fur, the fox's muscles and body looked like a monkey or a little man.
Now they were to the head. 
The neck was very long and the skin was very thick.

Maggie cut behind each ear, hidden now inside its own pelt. The two small ear canals.
I was surprised that this was the first point when I felt bothered, 
seeing the softness of his eyeballs under the thick skin being peeled away, 
and I held on to Maggie's arm.

Two very careful cuts and suddenly there he was, his dark jelly eyes watching the mask of his own face pulling downward.
Familiar black dog lips being pulled away from familiar sharp dog deeth.
And for a moment there were two foxes, kissing
until Lacey cut through the nose cartilage and they were separated.
