title: 2021.03.04 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Laundry

Laundry, cleaning the basement and my room. We have jars! =). I need to make another pass over all the electronic/wiring junk. I have a hoard at this point. Ancient stuff. Garlic rolls, Fireman Time!, [[TTTOTW]]. Up way too late.

Head on fire, but it's gucci. It was enough, and I've been here before. A glance at my machine, and tears after. Wish I knew how to put it into words. 

Hugs'n'bugs. They already walked (doing a great job avoiding me, as they point out). Slung some cards with 'em while talking about their day. Assigned the remaining tasks.

Talked some with [[K]]. More laundry, endless. [[TTTOTW]]. 

Shop @ W-Entity with my wife. We have enough pads now, `/salute`. Picked up my son's anchors (get it done, please). They lacked the cheesecloth, sadly. We waited in line forever. Grabbed almond flour for cookies for SL. Toothpicks, my old friend. Work was excellent for her (though draining). SL may continue to be reticent, but it appears she will be rational. The meeting with A was even better than I had hoped for. Secret decoder rings are OTW, and B, at the tippy top, has been name-dropping my wife. Good. Unfortunately, there's no way to short-circuit the bureaucracy here (we'll have to play inside it). It's interesting because I was about to anonymously reach out to her to offer my services, since our work is aligned (and I know how incompetent I am with machines, and the comparison scares me). These people are too old and serious about the wrong things for me; it is best that I stay in the background. The bestest news though is that Kevin is about to meet his maker (and now I see what C was doing [everyone there is more dangerous than I anticipated, a sane wolf in this case]).

Licked her toes (chemical taste, love) as she spoke with [[R]] (Happy Birthday, again). She keeps kicking me, and that only makes me want more. Then I got the wide-eyed and exaggeratedly mouthed //STAHP//. :P. I will pine for and next to your feet woman, stare in your eyes, and show you I am a good boi.

[[Family Gathering]] was dope. The meal was so fancy, I had to stop using so many cusswords, elevate my vernacular to something fitting for the feast. Zucchini and squash like I've never had, and it was soft (I fucking hate that texture so much, but it worked here...you got me). Hand-made risotto, and the best salmon (with hollandaise) I've ever had. It's the crust on that salmon. I'm clearly not just incompetent, but impatient. Scout and the offspring played the usual [[MTG]] match. I double held her hand while she talked. 

Dialectures with my daughter. Just sat there while she did the work she's promised to do for so long. Proof is painful. 

Nap in lap, then just went to bed. Could not stay awake. 9pm.
