[11:08 AM] chameleon: I'm guessing the next step is to get some real pipes installed
[11:08 AM] chameleon: pahp fitted
[11:09 AM] h0p3: XD.
[11:09 AM] h0p3: Yes, indeed.

[1:41 PM] h0p3: You been on muh brain. I hope you are doing alright. I know you see the evils of capitalism more clearly than most, and that probably shows up constantly for ya.
[1:42 PM] h0p3: Hopefully, you are able to get some solid chill time in with your hubby.
[2:08 PM] chameleon: Yeah, we've been holding down the fort
[2:08 PM] h0p3: `/salute`
[2:09 PM] chameleon: I've been super busy at work. Got a week off at least
[2:10 PM] h0p3: Hells yeah
[2:10 PM] h0p3: You think it will slow down at work some for ya? First 6 months are often hell.
[2:15 PM] chameleon: Yeah, i've been onboarding and shit
[2:16 PM] chameleon: I'm not a go-getter, so I'm sure once I have a bit more direction I'll be able to let off the gas
[2:16 PM] h0p3: Sounds expensive
[2:17 PM] chameleon: Plus hopefully I'll be able to set up my proper desk & finally build that new pc...
[2:17 PM] h0p3: That will be dope. I'm looking forward to seeing the pics.
[2:17 PM] chameleon: Kitchen table for now `^^`
[2:18 PM] h0p3: Aye. It works.
