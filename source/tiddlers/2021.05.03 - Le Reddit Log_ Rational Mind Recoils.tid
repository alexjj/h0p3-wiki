>>>>> Thank you for such a measured response. That is quite a story you got there. I'm glad to know what you think. I agree with your self-assessment, and I think you knew I would.

>>>>> It's a pleasure to meet you. My name is h0p3.

>>>> I also am a human, at least I think I am. I like to shape nature to my will, break things, build things, recycle earth's materials, and I especially enjoy transforming backyards into vegetable gardens and serene environs in which I can escape.

>>>> I like to eat what I grow and enjoy cooking for others. I like camping but only in the desert. I love water and learned to swim before I could walk. I like listening to people's stories and offering advice. I have a flash temper, but am just as quick to forgive. I have difficulty accepting compliments, yet I think quite highly of myself.

>>>> Overall though, I am alive and I am happy, which for reasons unbeknownst to me seems to confuse a hell of lot of people who seem to love acting miserable for no good reason.

>>>> And I'm genuinely fascinated by humans and their absurdities. You seem especially interesting. We share similar tastes in [music](https://philosopher.life/#2019.06.19%20-%20Retired%3A%20Music%3A%20Library:Root%20%5B%5BLegal%20Notice%5D%5D%20%5B%5B2019.06.19%20-%20Retired%3A%20Music%3A%20Library%5D%5D).

>>> XD. Wow. Lmao. Thank you. I like that I'm still perfectly insane to someone who can "[watch a person](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2f60ey/whats_your_sixth_sense/ck6b4c3/) for just a few seconds and tell you nearly everything about them...see who they are and what kind of person they are with only a glance."

>>> I'm a human. I like to travel, take selfies, and watch Netflix. A 4eak, really.

>>> How about you, what are you? I can only see bits and pieces of you through your account history.

>> I have been on this site for hours now... I can't even remember why.

>> The rational mind recoils in horror, but the blind animalistic side of my brain that genuinely enjoys breaking things is intrigued.

>> What are you?

> I'm an expensive person to speak with. [This](https://philosopher.life) is me. I would discuss these with you, if you wish.

saving for retirement- I only had high interest savings account and for fun would invest in stocks and had cds. Took downtime during the pandemic to realize how I should have invested into a roth years ago so now I'm maxing out as much as I can

be reasonable- I was less forgiving when I was younger. As I've gotten older I realize people aren't people and often have done really fucked up shit however people can and do change. Does everyone? No.

it's more work staying angry in order to be "right" than being happy and willing to agree to disagree - similar to #2.

dating gets more difficult as you get older- My mom was right at least for me (although I've heard women say dating has gotten easier as they have gotten older). I haven't been on a date in years and although I miss romance, I have other things going on for me in my life to be happy about.

worth it to pay extra for comfort- I used to be able to sleep on couches easily, have roommates, stay in hostels, or stay in dirty, cheap motels (many are however some aren't). Now I realize being comfortable makes a huge difference for me. That said, I'm a homebody and when I travel, I like to start early and return to a nice hotel room at night even if that means needing to be on a bus for 40 minutes vs being walking distance to bars and restaurants

count your blessings- When I think of adversity that I have had as an American female minority who is an older millennial adversities I see are often nothing compared to ones that people experience around the world.

I don't have the best relationships with my parents but often times think about how they may not be around here much longer. They gave me a good childhood overall and advice for life that I will pass down if ever I have a child.
