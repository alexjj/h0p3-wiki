title: 2022.06.27 - Prompted Introspection: cliché

!! Have you ever felt subject to a cliche? How did you react?

Dear Samwise,

These questions feel cliché to me. I reacted by writing about it, [[ITS]]. I have no idea what you intend with this line of questioning. Are you concerned with authenticity, bad generalizations, in[[justice]], or what? I don't even know how to draw fitting lines for cliches here. If you encounter enough words, most people's expressions seem kinda cliche.<<ref "p">>

What's wrong with being subject to principles, commonly used phrases, and familiar concepts?<<ref "h">> Nothing fundamentally. Can't we even be [[grateful]] for well-trodden territory and relatively well-understood terms? I realize, most people have neither the time nor the crayons<<ref "l">> to explain things to me. So, I kinda need me some of them cliches to navigate. 

At least almost anything that can be communicated can (and probably will) be misused, and not merely in the positivist's hypothetical imperative sense ([[ipcfa]]). Do I think people are too reductive, lazy, and immoral in how they reason, behave, and communicate? Yeah, no shit, of course. 

What do I do? Well, I suppose it depends on the context. Often, I'm just [[silent]].<<ref "s">> As for other reactions, in general, I've already done my work here in the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱. Thankfully, I'm free to let go in many cases.<<ref "f">> Obviously, I'm not always able or willing to do so.

Retards,

[[h0p3]]
