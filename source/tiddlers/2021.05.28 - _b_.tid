Privilege-naming privilege trumps both scary dog privilege and the privilege of making almost entirely useless things.

I lean toward the claim that when probability is most useful, it tends to be concerned with what is epistemic more than ontological. It's probably (ha) best to see probability as agent-centric. Note that a strict empiricist has access to partial, probabilistic inferences about an internalist constructed model in their own minds (which they tend to believe in wholesale [[faith]] to be contained in their body's head in a physical universe, and so forth [they also have to deny Berkeley without evidence]). However, taking up that position does possibly nothing to support (let alone push us toward a knock-drown-drag-out) Bayesian argument against Frequentism. From what I can see: they really aren't that different. However justified they may be in some contexts, both are ultimately //insufficient// on the hardest problems in epistemology, and neither can be king. Both can be reduced to subjective modeling of ~~states of affairs~~ [[phenomenology]] that realpolitik aim to circularly justify probabilistic statements from probabilistic statements while sweeping The Real^^tm^^ problem under the rug. This shit gets hard fast. Even Occam's Razor isn't something that can be 100% justified (a priori or otherwise); there are possible worlds in which it fails (and we can't know if our contexts happen to be one with certainty), and it's only ever an inductive rule-of-thumb concerning warrant. No one wants to admit they axiomatically rely upon metaphysics (a fool's task in many circles), and in doing so, they destroy any chance (ha) of genuine externalism by replacing one set of problems with another until they die. They silently act like they aren't biting the bullet in their priors to escape solipsism (we can debate how to interpret Saint Kant here), and I think that's one of the core sophistic conceits of elite^^tm^^ scientism today. Yes, the view from the high-horse is magnificent; thank you for noticing.

I have imposter syndrome about having imposter syndrome about having imposter syndrome.

One of the difficulties of [[hyperconversations]] is cultivating a justified [[faith]] that you aren't solipsistically interacting with only yourself. Obviously, this problem can be found in meatspace, but it's exacerbated in remote relationships and virtual community-building. I'm keenly aware of this with my ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±, [[FTO]] practices, and hyperreading methods. In online interactions, especially on platforms where identity-integrity and skin in the game on-the-wire are not required (or are even actively undermined), we are given the chance to choose which of the seemingly never-ending comments and objects we'll respond to, when we'll arbitrarily enter and leave conversations, and how we'll directly or indirectly steer discourse with little or no penalty or costs. As usual, we are neither [[vulnerable enough|ROG]] (in these perhaps quasi-principal-agent-problems) nor incentivized (though, remember kids: one ought to do what one ought to do because one ought to do it) to commit or follow through on treating each other as [[end]]s, and this often leads to giving into the temptations of conveniently filtering our conversation bubbles in a manner that may be functionally equivalent to engaging in conversations with mere representations of selected interlocutors we've constructed in our minds. If we do not honestly pursue [[The Other]] (including into offline connections), we run the high-risk of using others as mere means and trapping ourselves into narcissistically discovering mere projections of ourselves in digital mirrors of our choosing. Further, attention merchants have little incentive not to placate and exploit your egoism, and those with the most technical prowess and social capital in The Stack can bully without being bullied. To some [[dok]], we must fight back against these mimetic and memetic mechanisms that merely reproduce ourselves so that we may develop [[shared]] experiences that promote virtual [[embodied cognitive|Embodied Cognition]] interiority of [[the other]] in each of us that fosters bi-directional empathy and transformative [[intimacy]] (and that air you're breathing can be understood as a virtual bridge too, obviously). Take it from an au-teeste: our species is already terrible at this in meatspace too, terrifyingly so. While I have profound doubts that we cyborgs will use our tools wisely, I remain [[hope]]ful (even in my skepticism) that unique and justified existential progress remains available to us through technology. There appear to be cases where digital conversations are actually more direct and higher-bandwidth than standing in front of each other, especially when we can hand [[the other]] asynchronized [[privacy]] to our non-linear memories and stories.

Damn ~~kids~~ humans ~~these days~~ always.

Capitalized social networks, NFTs, IPRs, and other politicized illusions of scarcity oligopolistically bottleneck the use of (near-)non-rivalrous objects that could be cheaply abundant (at near zero marginal costs) in order to profit from the artificially induced production of exploitative zero-sum games of status online and offline. They are all short-sighted [[power]]-centralizing pyramid schemes of some kind.

Do not conflate humility with modesty, hedging, or articulately praying in the streets.
