title: 2020.09.08 - Prompted Introspection: What's Your Name?

!! What stupid question have you heard someone ask (or asked yourself)?

Are there stupid questions? At least half of mine are stupid, right? 

Oh, one I dread so much: "What's your name?" after they've already told me. `/cringe`. I am the absolute worst (I've had to ask it twice in the same conversation before...ugh, no, plz). There's something fucking wrong with me. It's not even that I look stupid: it's that it looks like I don't care. Even when I repeat their name out loud after they say it, it can slip out of my brain so easily. I think it's fair to say I'm not trying hard enough to keep it: I know that with repetition I can learn it. This wasn't a problem when I was young. I now have to write it down to remember.
