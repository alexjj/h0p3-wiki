title: 2020.12.31 - Prompted Introspection: So Into Myself

!! Would you date yourself?

Sounds narcissistic. 

My life would be considerably more hedonically pleasing if I were significantly bisexual at this point. I'm working toward it through personality shaping, but I have my doubts. So, at the moment, no. One day? Maybe. That said, I don't think I'd find myself attractive still. If dating is necessarily about fucking (even if only indirectly, to some [[dok]], and so forth), then I don't see it happening. 

I would like to befriend myself or at least some versions of myself. I already take myself be engaged in that task over my [[4DID]], and, if I'm lucky, with some MLed version of this [[ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱]] (similar to [[Aispondence]]). I have no idea how it would or will play out.
