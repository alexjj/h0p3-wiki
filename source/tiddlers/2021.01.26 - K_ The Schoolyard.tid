Checkin' in with ya, sir. How are you feeling? How's your work going? You gettin any chill time in?
Jan 26 7:03am
Stressed haha. I worked for 12 hours yesterday with a few breaks for groceries and meals. Got about seven assignments done. üôÉ
Jan 26 10:56am
If I keep this pace though, I can pull ahead quickly
Jan 26 10:56am
How are you doing?
Jan 26 10:56am
got dayum, lol
Jan 26 10:56am
Yeah I‚Äôm not doing well haha
Jan 26 11:06am
But I‚Äôm trying to keep my head up.
Jan 26 11:07am
Yes, sir.
Jan 26 11:07am
(I'm not sure what to say, just sitting here looking at your words thinking and feeling.)
Jan 26 11:08am
It‚Äôs all good. This is the busy semester after all. I knew what I signed up for. :)
Jan 26 11:08am
My only regret is that I couldn‚Äôt start therapy before shit hit the fan.
Jan 26 11:09am
Aye. Pretty crazy hard now.
Jan 26 11:09am
I asked the doctor about it over a month ago and they put in a Referral. I never got a call so I messaged them back a few weeks ago and they said ‚ÄúYeah we forgot. Here. Call them.‚Äù
Jan 26 11:09am
I‚Äôm just....what? Lol. How unprofessional. XD
Jan 26 11:10am
Lol
Jan 26 11:10am
They get paid way too well to make mistakes like that, but perhaps it's insane for them. Hopefully it can start up soon.
Jan 26 11:11am
I need to do that myself.
Jan 26 11:11am
Was supposed to get bloodwork done a year ago.
Jan 26 11:11am
No idea how to tell them my story.
Jan 26 11:12am
I'm hanging in there just fine. Despite the [[pause]], I'm balancing a lot.
Jan 26 11:13am
Excited to see [[5c0ut]], maybe tomorrow.
Jan 26 11:14am
(last chance to see him in person for a while, I think)
Jan 26 11:14am
Same. We both have a lot to unpack lmao. 

How have those conversations been going?
Jan 26 11:14am
Wasn‚Äôt he coming to stay with you all?
Jan 26 11:15am
I'm pretty sure I need to not initiate with her. I want to make sure her primary relationship blossoms (and, I don't think he likes me very much). I want to talk to her everyday obviously.
Jan 26 11:16am
That sucks. :/
Jan 26 11:16am
I‚Äôm really sorry to hear that.
Jan 26 11:18am
Definitely feeling stuck. She hopped into mumble last night (while I was asleep), and I didn't hear her voice to wake me up (went to sleep at 7pm, lol). I'm pretty worried that my building intimacy with her comes at a cost with [[P]].
Jan 26 11:20am
I've been writing in the wiki again, though it's with timestamps turned off, somewhat stealth. Checking the diffs between snapshots can show it.
Jan 26 11:21am
It's good though. I'm shooting for a decade from now with her.
Jan 26 11:21am
Glad to hear you‚Äôre getting some writing done. Sorry for the slow reply. I was looking [[P]] up. üëÄ
Jan 26 11:30am
Are you colleagues in philosophy and writing?
Jan 26 11:33am
Nope. He does not read my words. That letter was a surprise to us. I think it was intended to do something different.
Jan 26 11:34am
An invitation to connect perhaps?
Jan 26 11:38am
Perhaps.
Jan 26 11:39am
What do you envision your relationship goals to be for the next decade? Still sorting that out I assume? :)
Jan 26 11:43am
I don't know. We've talked about it. The range is wide.
Jan 26 11:44am
Oh yeah. And changing daily I bet. Hopefully we can reach a post-COVID world way before that deadline.

Jan 26 11:45am
Going through the wiki, through our story, and writing again with it: https://philosopher.life/#%E1%9B%9DLight%E1%9B%9D
Jan 26 11:46am
Just flying by the seat of my pants here.
Jan 26 11:46am
I have no idea what I'm doing, as usual.
Jan 26 11:46am
I‚Äôm digging in.
Jan 26 12:03pm
Will have thoughts soon.
Jan 26 12:03pm
Wow. You both definitely have feelings for each other. Is P also poly or monogamous? I meant to ask but I forgot.
Jan 26 1:14pm
[[P]]*
Jan 26 1:14pm
The schoolyard crush is adorable, but seeing where we‚Äôre at now is bound to be hurtful. I‚Äôll be thinking about you all.
Jan 26 1:14pm
Gotcha. Will catalogue that. :)
Jan 26 1:14pm
P prefers monogamy.
Jan 26 1:19pm
It's something they are negotiating and thinking about. It's one of the reasons I'm pulling back.
Jan 26 1:23pm
I appreciate that you‚Äôre giving them space and prioritizing her happiness. 

I also love that callout of ‚Äúyou should be writing with her!‚Äù
Jan 26 1:24pm
I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs an active talk on their end. It sounds like there‚Äôs room for compromise when considering the letter with the context of everything.
Jan 26 1:25pm
Within*
Jan 26 1:25pm
I‚Äôll keep thinking on this issue. I appreciate the update. :)
Jan 26 1:28pm
Gracias, sir. I'm easily blinded here.
Jan 26 1:32pm
For what it‚Äôs worth. Your priorities are in order and I think you‚Äôve shown your heart/ intentions in a really transparent way. You‚Äôve made the best of the situation thus far. At least I think so. :)
