title: 2020.07.20 - Prompted Introspection: Hairy Sumbitch

!! What is something about yourself that you dislike?

[[2019.07.31 - Prompted Introspection: My Whirlwind]] and [[2017.12.21 - Prompted Introspection Log: Dislike About Myself]] are serious and accurate. I don't think I've improved on that front much either. `/sigh`. Yup.

Alright, I'm going to shift gears and paint something else, something more physical (though I still want to question the nature of the self here). I have mixed feelings about how hairy I am, and I don't like it to some extent. Of course, I aim to limit how much I care about appearances and social pressures, but I'm still allowed to dislike it. 

Hair is hot. I wear a sweater (on top of my layer of blubber). This isn't so good during global warming. I'm the classic sweaty neckbeard. I'm more bearpig than I am man. I feel like a werewolf, caveman, or hobbit. I don't like that I'm penalized for it in blink-of-an-eye judgments, but that is not really me disliking a part of myself so directly. Even I find my hairiness unattractive though. I also don't like how my hair can be so easily pulled, and tape/bandaids/sticky_substances hurt. In-grown hair is also more common.  I don't like that I leave traces of myself and hair as residue on people I touch (they don't like it either). Lastly, it's significantly harder to clean my asshole; getting peanut butter out of my carpet requires far too much TP (though my bidet has been pure magic).
