I'm not opposed to an existence fee we pay to society. It's difficult to conceive, let alone put into practice, a fitting authority in the pursuit of [[justice]]. More importantly, some people are more capable of paying the fee, and the prioritization of taxing our essences has as much force to it as prioritizing suffering in the world. One way of saying it is: we have the obligation to pursue communism, but not necessarily the right to behave as though it already obtains.

Even with the inarticulacy of alexithymia, high-functioning autists make for some of the highest bandwidth empaths around. Towers of sensation, unclouded by mere norms, seeking the universal as an outsider. Quell the chaos, please.

Too often we experience what we predict we will experience in virtue of that habituated prediction alone.

It is a privilege to ritualize the manner in which one eats a particular kind of candy.

A Bayesian process that tends to only increase my induction confidence through more examples may not necessarily help with the [[SO]] accumulation of distinctions between theories that allow me to make better and more justified inferences about said examples. That's a non-trivial problem in thinking better, and I don't know how to define the justified updating process well enough in the end.
