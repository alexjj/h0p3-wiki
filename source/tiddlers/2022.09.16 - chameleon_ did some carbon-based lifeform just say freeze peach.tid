So it seems to me that what I need to get writing these days is a stiff drink. Not just any old cocktail, but something like a pint of 50% absinthe, 50% rocket fuel ([[LOX|https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Z6rhk95-FVU]]). Rage is a motivator, as is disappointment.

Nihao, O senpai, [[I see you|https://philosopher.life/#2022.09.16%20-%20Link%20Log%3A%20unlikely%20to%20satisfy%20pedantic%20academic%20referees]]. Though I'm quiet and semi-retired I keep my ear to the ground and read the intertubes. So one of these (the absinthe) is an article which reads like a Kremlin dispatch and the other (the LOX) is a maymay. Absinthe-wise, I note the convergance of what until now had been disparate currents/factions: tankie anti-imperialist agitators, Russian propaganda peddlers, and people that make a lot of noise about free speech but are silent on [[actual free speech violations|https://www.cbsnews.com/news/queen-elizabeth-britain-monarchy-criticism-protester-arrests-free-speech-uk/]]. Whyfore? KISS: I think they're all funded by the Russian state, and the Ukraine flashpoint has made them desperate to turn the propaganda knob up to 11. We know well how they fund far-right groups to stir up shit; from Trump to Le Pen, they're all being paid in Rubles. Is it so hard to believe that they're also funding "left"ist voices, too? Take Assange; we know he had dirt on Trump too, that he didn't release, and we know he has connections to Russia. Russia can, occasionally, be a neutral force as it comes to our local squabbles; but dissent in its greatest rival is good for Russia, so dissent will be stirred up where it can. We do well not to ignore connections to Russia. I note that it's only the third paragraph of this where the author reveals they were part of RT - which is not a neutral outlet, it's a wing of the Russian propaganda machine. Eyes turn back to the Special Military fascist invasion: [[Russia's getting its ass kicked|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umDsCyZ67J0]]. Now you and I see through the general propaganda around this; there are no good wars. Still, let us not pretend this was a neutral event. This is an invasion by a fascist state of a neighboring country - a democracy at that. Support or running interference for the actions of Russia in this event is spreading fascist propaganda. That "censored" podcast? It's still up on Twitter, unmolested, happily doing exactly that. Such is the way with the "cancel culture" free speech brigade - "I'm being censored!" they cry from their best-selling novel, NYT column, or TV show.

What of the rocket fuel? I don't know. The meme just makes me sad. It's sad that people hate us (trans people) so much they'll waste their time getting into isolate political communities - ever a bastion of mental health and happiness, said no one ever. It's sad that the people they meet won't be able to get help, because yeah, these political circlejerks are not going to help you. Note that truly radical (i.e. anarchist) politics don't create these spaces; they are mostly the purview of the fascist right and the fascist (tankie) left. The commenter does not go into it, but I guarantee those spaces are all about Putin's heroic fight against Ukrainian fascism, or the glory of Assad's Syria, or whatever else the tankie party line is this week. Communism in 20 years, guys - from now until forever. Yeah, truth be told, I've been to spaces like that, on both bollocks of the political phallus. Go into far-right spaces and it's a bunch of miserable cunts complaining about how they can't get a date, how they still live with their parents, and how hot they think NTR concrete enema baby-in-a-blender porn is. Go into tankie spaces, and it's the same but with hammer-and-sickles and cat ears. The far-right are, largely, miserable, paranoid losers - because, and this is the same with the tankies, they're largely recruited from video game and anime spaces that attract extremely online virgins, and exist in spaces that only encourage their worst, most anti-social impulses. Don't judge the group by the outlier - I know a lot of trans people (including myself) that are happily in a romantic relationship, gainfully employed, and have good familial bonds.

I don't know what motivated me to write this stupid and circular screed. I guess part of it is I recognize these blind spots of yours; and part of it is anxiety about Christian fascism that that stupid article stoked up in me. I want to stop these people (i.e. the Christian fascists), but I'm certain that crying about Alex Jones' freeze peach is not the way to do it. This isn't a callout post, it's a cry for help ;)
