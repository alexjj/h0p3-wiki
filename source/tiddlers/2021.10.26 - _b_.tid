Imagine the need to feel wanted being fulfilled as a customer. "I'm never coming back here again," expecting the employees to go through emotional labor of trying to salvage and negotiate the relationship between narcissist customers and narcissistic capitalists just to survive. That is, after all, why they exist: to mediate our desire feedback loops channeled into the structures of capitalism. It too is [[the other]], and one we must work to destroy.

You may begin the fight, if you wish. I will continue to point out that we must triage and prioritize. Odds are good you aren't the immediate, direct benefactor of [[justice]]. There are billions of people in far greater need of vindication than you. Class is the fundamental problem. At best, your politics are a joke if you aren't explicit about it. It's easy to pick out which [[pleft]]ists in name are just egoists.

Beware the reactionaries who claim climate change isn't all that catastrophic because land nearer the poles will become useful. It is hard to gauge how many millions (maybe billions) are going to suffer or die simply from lacking water, increased infection rates, and the problem of migration. The costs of losing whatever optimization we have is non-trivial too.

It's an ideology to believe ideology merely represents our imaginary relationship to our real conditions of existence. Some beliefs and judgments are about the imaginary, of course, but not all. Let me guess: you think normativity parallels children and adults pretending to believe in Santa with each other. What a convenient delusion to hold, let me try to hold that belief about your beliefs with you, Pyrrho.

Choosing to forego, preventing, or eliminating engaging in criticism, contempt, defensiveness, and stonewalling is not always justified, and a world which didn't wisely wield these feelings, thoughts, and behaviors would have the wrong shape too. Some lines should be quite expensive to draw together.
