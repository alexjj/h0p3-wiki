"""
How are you doing today? Hoping this goes through. Signal was dead yesterday lol.
Jan 16 11:08am
Hrm. And, My response to your previous question isn't here.
Jan 16 1:21pm
I'm not sure what she'd respond to from you.
Jan 16 1:21pm
She's pretty shy in many respects.
Jan 16 1:22pm
I'm fine. Not great sleep. Up late responding to folks on that video.
Jan 16 1:22pm
Signal has had a massive influx of users.
Jan 16 1:23pm
Can't put servers into production fast enough.
Jan 16 1:23pm
How about you?
Jan 16 1:23pm
Aye, now that I‚Äôm looking around I see articles and stuff. Glad they‚Äôre getting the traffic at least haha.
Jan 16 4:27pm
Doing fine. Having a chill day. I have stuff I could work on but MLK Day on the horizon is a helpful buffer. :)
Jan 16 4:27pm
[[k0sh3k]] and the kids having a good weekend too?
Jan 16 4:27pm
Forgot about mlk.
Jan 16 4:31pm
Yeah. Chill for us. Chores. Walmart.
Jan 16 4:31pm

How's school going?
Jan 21 7:02am
BUSY but my buffer is slowly getting bigger :)
Jan 21 8:57am
How are you?
Jan 21 8:57am
What kind of buffer do you mean?
Jan 21 8:58am
I'm doing well enough. Still thinking and feeling through what it's like not to be working on my wiki.
Jan 21 8:59am
What are you enjoying the most so far this semester, and what the least?
Jan 21 8:59am
Since my work is sorted out chronologically, I‚Äôm trying to push the next due date as far out as possible so I‚Äôm not scrambling to get weekly assignments done and so I have more time to work on my bigger papers. :)

I bet it‚Äôs gotta be weird for you. Hope sorting through those feelings and having good talks is fruitful so far. 

I‚Äôm happy to only be taking three classes but it still feels like four. I have so many weekly assignments due for every class and it‚Äôs all busy work. I also feel like I could handle the load better if I weren‚Äôt working but I don‚Äôt want to just quit. Finding that balance right now is difficult.
Jan 21 9:02am
Yes, sir.
Jan 21 9:03am
I'm sorry it is busy work.
Jan 21 9:03am
My assumption is that spending time in the actual classroom with young ones is among the more interesting and rewarding parts of your school work at the moment.
Jan 21 9:05am
(and, yes, it's been weird for me, lol)
Jan 21 9:05am
It‚Äôs funny you mention that because a student came to tutoring yesterday not because they needed help but just because they wanted some company. It was a nice time.
Jan 21 9:05am
Fuck yeah.
Jan 21 9:06am
The human interactions.
Jan 21 9:06am
It was a nice way to pump the brakes and remember that these are the reasons I want to reach.
Jan 21 9:06am
exactly :)
Jan 21 9:06am
Teach**
Jan 21 9:07am
Brain is still waking up haha
Jan 21 9:07am
Student teaching is coming in the fall. I‚Äôm nervous and excited. Nervous for how it will operate mid pandemic but excited to finally jump in
Jan 21 9:09am
My prediction is that you will be incredibly sensitive to the moral needs of your students in a way that will be very expensive to reflect upon. They will be lucky to have you. I wish my offspring were able to have you as their teacher.
Jan 21 9:11am
I have no idea what the fuck is happening in 2021. I can appreciate being nervous about that too.
Jan 21 9:12am
Agreed. I‚Äôm still hoping we might be able to collaborate on a teaching project at some point. I think their perspective would be interesting for a big paper.
Jan 21 9:14am
Some of my mentor teachers keep talking about ‚Äúthe pivot back to in person instruction‚Äù but we just started getting vaccines.
Jan 21 9:15am
There‚Äôs no way it‚Äôs coming so soon.
Jan 21 9:15am
You know me, I'm what some would call a conspiracy theorist. I do not think vaccines are being rolled out fast enough on purpose. May that change.
Jan 21 9:16am

How's [[L]] doing?
Jan 21 9:17am
I also wonder just how effective they will be since they were crafted in a single year. I think being apprehensive is wise but do we really have a choice in not taking it?  I‚Äôm just hoping for the best and will keep my eyes peeled for when it becomes available for us. University had already begun planning for us to get them but family aren‚Äôt on the list. I would rather [[L]] and I get it together. 

She‚Äôs doing okay. Work is annoying and they don‚Äôt appreciate the work she does. Those that are above her ignore emails and don‚Äôt pay attention in meetings it seems. She‚Äôs frustrated and rightfully so. Whenever I try to convince her to take an extended break it ends up not happening out of a sense of obligation. I admire that about her but this job isn‚Äôt worth the extra hassle of worry lol. She‚Äôs doing a lot of heavy lifting for me so I can focus on my work and I‚Äôm grateful. I may have to ask her to do a little bit more around the house so I can get more work done. She‚Äôs been reading a lot more which makes her happy. If it helps her cope with the stress of our current world, then I‚Äôm glad she can do so. We certainly have a ton of books lol.
Jan 21 9:25am
No idea how effective. There's a fuckton of money in it though, more than met my eye at first. I don't know when it will become available to us either.
Jan 21 9:29am
I'm glad to hear she's reading. That's a worthy escape.
Jan 21 9:30am
[[k0sh3k]]'s been reading a ton more too lately.
Jan 21 9:30am
I've become illiterate, lol. Books?! Lmao.
Jan 21 9:30am

üòÇ
(except for graphic novels, I'm a sucker)
Jan 21 9:30am
How's your extended family doing?
Jan 21 9:32am
I‚Äôve got a few books that I‚Äôm working on but you know me. My poison is largely digital and masked by number go up. I‚Äôve been playing Yakuza Like a Dragon and I‚Äôm incredibly impressed by its layered storytelling. Unfortunately I haven‚Äôt had much time to touch it recently. 

I have a lot of extended family news actually. My brother Austin is going by Cheyenne now. We‚Äôve been keeping it under wraps but she‚Äôs officially out of the closet now. Her fianc√© and daughter have been very understandings and supportive. Carson and his fianc√© have had a baby girl recently too. My brother Chase is holding down a job and living with some friends and two of my sisters- Georgia and Emileigh are attending college together. My folks almost have an empty nest now lol.
Jan 21 9:36am
My birth father and I are no longer speaking due to his disagreement surrounding Cheyenne. Definitely tried to have a nuanced talk about gender but he was unwilling to budge. So fuck em.
Jan 21 9:37am
Sounds like the younger generation is fighting for it, and the the older generation may be left behind.
Jan 21 9:44am
Aye. I understand the generational divide but surprisingly enough, our parents are open and willing to try and be respectful despite their conservative and biblically traditional beliefs. I am grateful for it, as I‚Äôm sure my sister is too.
Jan 21 9:46am
Cool.
Jan 21 9:46am
[[L]]‚Äôs family is being kind too. [[AA]] is a little strange about it, but not in a disrespectful way. We‚Äôll have to discuss it more when it comes up.
