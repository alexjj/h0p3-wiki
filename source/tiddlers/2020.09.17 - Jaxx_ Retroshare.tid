[20.09.17 - 14:53:41] Jaxx: Does anyone what kind of hash/encryption this is?: e9ac8aa0e754aa6b4ea861ba44cbf732
[20.09.17 - 15:33:22] h0p3: My guess is MD5.
[20.09.17 - 15:35:40] h0p3: This is the retroshare channel, and we never talk about it. I, uh, very much admire the idealism and the attempts to practice those ideals in retroshare.
[20.09.17 - 15:36:29] Jaxx: huh?
[20.09.17 - 15:36:44] h0p3: That's that channel it looks like to me*
[20.09.17 - 15:37:20] Jaxx: well. its retroshare channel,but theres no rules about discussing other things here
[20.09.17 - 15:37:28] h0p3: Forgive me, I'm an autistic schizophrenic. I'm often wrong and fail to speak well too. 
[20.09.17 - 15:37:35] h0p3: I'm very glad we get to speak about everything here.
[20.09.17 - 15:37:43] Jaxx: :D
[20.09.17 - 15:37:52] Jaxx: as long as a_Smith allows it ofcourse
[20.09.17 - 15:38:19] h0p3: We get to be humans together here. I value that more than I will be able to explain to you in words and symbols.
[20.09.17 - 15:38:32] Jaxx: no worries
[20.09.17 - 15:39:11] h0p3: I have been thinking out loud about myself and the world (https://philosopher.life) for several years.
[20.09.17 - 15:39:17] h0p3: My name is h0p3.
[20.09.17 - 15:49:52] h0p3: It's a pleasure and an honor to meet you all.
[20.09.17 - 16:05:14] A_Smith: https://www.zerohedge.com/medical/west-coast-wildfires-causing-smoky-skies-far-east-new-york-city
[20.09.17 - 16:12:41] h0p3: Aye. I live in CT: https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/weather-news/stories/smoke-from-west-coast-wildfires-visible-in-connecticut/2332700/
[20.09.17 - 16:12:56] h0p3: Weather is chillier for it. 
[20.09.17 - 16:13:57] h0p3: I've been thinking about another piece of technology that is merely a fraction of what I [[hope]]d (<--this is the markup for a link to a page/tiddler in my wiki, and I even use it while messaging people who know me...I do my best to think about [[all conversations|Contact]] [[wisely|The Right]], [[WINTCIS]]) to see in Saint [[Retroshare|Links: Libraries of Alexandria]]. What do you all think of [[Aether|P2P: Aether]]:
