[[TTTOTW]], bread, and water. 

Sleep was solid. Woke at 9. [[TTTOTW]]. For half a second, I experienced boredom. It was amazing. Thrilling. Impossible. Fireman Time!, as one does, in these situations. [[TTTOTW]]. All it takes is a single image to set me on the right path: Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

Noticed that video playback, at least in FF (last update made it look purty and slow), has been fucking terrible. Ugh. Alright. Anyway, went for a full Syu reboot just to see. Yup. Still FF doing FF things. Chromium when in doubt. All Tabs Helper. =(. RIP.

Broski came to vape and chill, talk, watched a LolVod. 

Played a game with my daughter. She lays the verbal smackdown. She goes T1 Top, T2 SFM->Jitte, T3->BSkull. Kor haven, JKite, CoW, Strip Mine, and Disk handle the game (with a non-trivial ORing mistake on my CoW). Complete prison. She's adding red. 

Bugged my wife. She's unhappy about the pawpaw plants, they aren't in good condition. We'll see if we can make them come alive. 

Drive to DMV, she was anxious. Much more anxious than I would have anticipated. She's feeling a lot of anxiety lately. Management drains everything. A complete fucking farce. Life slows down, but it's still high-paced. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Fuck me, someone came down to fuck me. Inform the Men! Meditation.

[[TTTOTW]].

[[Family Gathering]]. Fuck me. I don't remember what happened. I know my son and I played a round of magic, and then he wanted to play chess, so we got to do that too.

Chilled with my wife on the couch. Snuggles. Yeah, she probably will have her period soon. Those inferences don't add up. She's more self aware lately too. I'm not even the one who is calling it. 

Son was given a choice of what room to work on. He chose mine. =). We mounted instruments on the wall. The boys chilled. 

Daughter DDed her disk and got to work on monolith. Thank you.
