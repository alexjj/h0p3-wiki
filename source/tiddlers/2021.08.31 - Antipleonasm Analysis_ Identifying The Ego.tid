title: 2021.08.31 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Identifying The Ego

!! Respond to [[the following|Why Not A Wide Area Network, Watson?]]:

<<<
The ego is nothing other than the focus of conscious attention.
<<<

That may be a hasty reduction. I'm hesitant to define [[the ego|The Ego Tunnel: The Science of the Mind and the Myth of the Self]]. I also think {[[Focus]]} is not merely of my immediate, present [[phenomenology]];<<ref "p">> there may be emergent and nested kinds, and even the entire clusters of experience-processes that comprise my [[4DID]] may not be identical with my ego. I am not convinced we must conflate these, neither with conscious attention, nor its focus. I suggest the ego experiences or at least plays a significant role in our conscious attention, but that's a much weaker claim. There are unconscious aspects of the ego, but the same has to be true of our conscious attention. To my eyes, the ego is more closely tied to a set of desires that tend to seek the ego's survival (including the conditions of what it models itself to be, not as merely a body, but even as mental parts that it believes<<ref "t">> to be constitutive or even valuable to its evolving essence),<<ref "a">> pursue the satisfaction of its own desires, and at least the temptation to extend its Spinozan essence qua the will to [[power]]. The ray of intentionality need not be intentionality itself though. It appears that one's {[[Focus]]} is a different function, and one that the ego helps choose to direct in some respects. The ego is something to be checked, to be shaped, and this is true of our {[[Focus]]} as well, but perhaps not in an identical sense. They are obviously extremely related; there's probably some key isomorphisms here, but I do not see absolute equivalence. I don't think I'd be too broken up if they were, but I not only don't have enough material to make that bet, I don't think the claim jives with the evidence. That you take it to be case may even be further evidence against it, as this may just be a continuation of how you've conveniently misframed the self.

<<footnotes "p" "There's clearly peripheral aspects of our phenomenology that are at least at the fuzzy edges of our ray of intentionality, if not beyond. There are horizons as well, but even these aren't always so clearcut. I don't deny a focus to the ego, but it may be more. This is still too reductive: there's something like heterogeneous computing to consider here, and focus seems to be a very low-level, low-ring, high performance process (and I cannot say that it is strictly computational, though that is a necessary component). There's only so much we can hold all-at-once, and the ego seems to hold more than its focus.">>

<<footnotes "t" "I suggest this is the case. I still may be attributing too many mental states to the ego here.">>

<<footnotes "a" "Your amygdala will trigger in self-defense of your [[faith]], your ideology, your sunk costs in your self-storytelling, your habituated S1 algorithms that were so expensive to acquire, and the hard-earned, habituated, predictive process oriented, energy-efficient runtimes that you don't have to think so much about as well. This too is a non-trivial reason to believe consciousness is not epiphenomenal (beyond our own experience of it); it's so expensive, it seems (hardly knock-down, drag-out, but I don't think you'll acquire that with any science).">>
