You too can become a sociopathic [[cult]] leader by smiling, opening in a friendly manner, letting your interlocutor save face, never [criticizing, condemning, or complaining], giving what appears to be honest and sincere [appreciation, praise, interest, or respect] for your interlocutor (make them feel important, especially in public), allowing [[the other]] to do all the talking, avoiding argumentation, asking questions rather than giving orders, using the other person's name, personality mirroring, sticking to topics that interest your interlocutor, quickly and definitively admitting one's errors, and convincing them you've tried to empathize.

OCPD optimizing for [[The Good]], Schizophrenic abused shaman leading society with their vision, Antisocial personality disorder spotting NPCs from a mile away, Avoidant following the Hippocratic Oath, Histrionic who enjoys people so much, Schizoid outlier with a measure of independent perspective, ADHD bored and angry with the status quo, Depressive glowing too brightly for the box they've been shoved into, Manic revolutionary hero on a shoestring budget, and Borderline as the most loving and loyal person you'll meet, if they choose you.

It's so brave of the 'post-left anarchists' (i.e. [[pright]]ists, yet another example of why Libertarianism [and I know plenty of scholars who get the term wrong] can never be [[pleft]]ist) to pursue not putting abstract ideas above their own needs and desires. It's so convenient to magically believe that absolute voluntary cooperation maximizes freedom and access to necessities for survival and pleasure while not requiring any radical governance or major sacrifice on our part to legislate, execute, and adjudicate.
