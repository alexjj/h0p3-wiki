title: 2021.09.10 - Prompted Introspection: A-Bomb

!! Which technology should not have been invented?

This is a keeper, Samwise. I can only assume there are nearly countless answers to give (and some causal consequentialist complexities to consider as well), and it's important to inspect it.

The Atomic Bomb is an easy one. It wasn't necessary, and it still isn't necessary. I'm not convinced Oppenheimer should be forgiven, nor the other geniuses who obviously should have known better. It probably would have been better that you were an unrecognized, wasted genius working in the fields than to have created what you did. Science as something distinct from the empiricism of [[phenomenology]] is only ever a tool, and often, only to the benefit of the most [[power]]ful who would do anything to keep and cultivate their domination. Violence is often necessary, but this crosses a different line. It is hard to believe you wouldn't kill innocent lives with it. Surely, there are better ways to engage in conflict. The A-bomb is the last refuge of the incompetent, right?
