title: 2020.10.01 - Prompted Introspection: Recovering

!! What are you recovering from right now?

Mmmm. That's an odd question. I suppose it's an important one in a lot of cases and valuable enough to just ask out of the blue.<<ref "s">> There seem to be too many insufficiently relevant as well as too many inflammatory answers to give here. I also think recovery is rarely of the original but more likely another version or path. I think I'm still trying to find the right give and take with the world. I don't trust myself or anyone to draw the lines well enough, and yet that is my plight: to find and build that trust. Lol. I'm not powerless, but I feel it (and conveniently when I ought not).
