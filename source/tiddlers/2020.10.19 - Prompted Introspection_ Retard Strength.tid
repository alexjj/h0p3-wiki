title: 2020.10.19 - Prompted Introspection: Retard Strength

!! In what way are you strong?

In some cases, I have a willingness to grind. I can sometimes embrace it, [[WINTCIS]]. It's fair to say I'm not wise enough with my {[[Focus]]} and also that I'm not wise enough with where I direct what strengths I have. Obsessiveness allows me to chase [[ridtyawtr]] like a madman. I am privileged to be able to engage in processes that most people find ridiculous (often simply virtue of how it doesn't benefit them). I don't wish to throw my life away (and that would be easy enough to do). I think persistence in my seeking (even resilience sometimes) is an enduring dispositional strength. Again, I realize that many people scoff at seeking (or find mine queer, confusing, and retarded), but the grind in the desert seems to be the only method.<<ref "w">>
