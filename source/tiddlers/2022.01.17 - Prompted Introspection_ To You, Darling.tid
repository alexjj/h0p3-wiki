title: 2022.01.17 - Prompted Introspection: To You, Darling

!! Write a letter to your teenage self, giving advice and revealing what the future holds.

The full answer to this is distributed throughout and pretty deep into the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱. This html file serves many purposes, including engaging in the very process you've [[prompted|Prompted Introspection]]. Just a glimpse at a quintessential example found in a place that I barely even speak about (`/wink`), //About://{[[About]]}<<ref "adaf">> commands:

<<<
Become your own ideal father.
<<<

Indeed.

I've always been speaking to the [[young'ns|2020.09.13 - Prompted Introspection: Like This One]] in my [[retarded gibberish|SURFER GOD AARDVARK TRANSLATION: YOU PEOPLE FDUCKING DISGUSTMEMe xD]].<<ref "y">> Yo, I must add, there's a fuckton of [[BAGD]] quietly woven at many levels into the fabric of this place, and I've also poorly answered this [[prompt]] before:

* [[2018.07.08 - Prompted Introspection: Teenage Me]]
* [[2020.04.07 - Prompted Introspection: Teen Angst]]

So, I suppose I should explore it more. 

Can you be more specific, Samwise? Though there is plenty of overlap, there's a huge difference between 13yo me (gdoghomes) and 19yo me (4eak).<<ref "A">> Pick out a year (or even a particular month), and my letter will vary. I guess I'm trying to give a blanket letter here. Alrighty then:

<<<
Dear Current or Soon To Be 4eak,

[[Know Thyself]]. Indeed, you are a 4eak. =D. Don't be ashamed (oh, you don't even know yet: you're autistic!), and be weary of those who would not even attempt to understand you (hint: that's almost everyone you've ever encountered, even the ones who appear interested in you). Most people are going to lie to you constantly, and you are far too gullible. Don't be so optimistic; you have no fucking clue how evil most people are, and you've not studied the world well enough (you aren't reading enough, loser - and, no, you will never not be retarded). You aren't working hard enough: do not rest upon being intelligent. Fucking //use// it (I have been – and always shall be – your friend and retard, homie). You should run with your interest in computers and logic, particularly in philosophy and decentralization (you have a headstart few have). You need to read and write way more than you do. Put the [[vidya]] [[games]] down (spend more time [[masturbating|Masturbation]] though). Dude, if you've not met her yet, you will: find your [[wife|k0sh3k]] at Berea (don't graduate so early either, loser). Don't have children, but adopt them at 30. You should actually study for classes and tests because your learning was never about getting merely a grade (and you should fucking know better by now :P), and you need to talk with academics more than you do. There's a fuckton you were taught wrong, and most of the people in your life are non-trivially lying to you somewhere. Oh, hey, you should read and write moar. Overall, you're doing a good job in a hard place, sir. `/salute`. 

[[Love]],

[[h0p3]]

p.s. Oh, btw, it just came out or is just about to come out, check out Tiddlywiki (so forget writing html by hand or using wordpress, or at least go back to just using textfiles, please). In fact, here, I've attached a copy of what you wrote in another life. I suggest reading the entire thing, and considering how the [[Link Log]] picks out a ton of things that don't exist yet, that's kinda doable. I wish you [[luck]], [[nomad]].

p.p.s. You know what? I'm doing this all wrong, as usual. I've attached a copy of a subset of my 2022 Wikipedia, names and information of people to [[contact]], all the most crucial, compressible text objects referenced in [[The Library]] and more (I'm taking all of your hard drive space...go buy another and make copies!!!!!!!!!!), a bunch of lottery numbers and dates, source/binaries/schematics, important events that you can leverage, and I hope you'll figure out how to use it well. I have no idea. 

p.p.p.s. I apologize for the garbage performance of this []D[][]V[][]D wiki, homie, whenever you might be able to get it to even theoretically work for you. You can get by with a text editor in many cases. [[ITS]], you'll find the [[link]] to this [[letter]] at [[2022.01.17 - Prompted Introspection: To You, Darling]]. Do explore hard and fast. Don't be afraid! Dive.
