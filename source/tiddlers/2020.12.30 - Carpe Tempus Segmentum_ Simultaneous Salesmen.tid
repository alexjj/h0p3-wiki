title: 2020.12.30 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Simultaneous Salesmen

One of my favorite parts of //Dune//, //Lazarus//, and even //Ender's Game// is how the family unit, in its supposed evolutionary glory, is displayed as a unit of warfare facing many conflicting fronts. Even together, it is a wrastlin' with the world we can see and beyond.

* Worked on my wife's room. It gets closer. 
* Walked [[AIR]] through his home. Thinking about the future.
** He's puking. =(. 
** Take a break when you get here. It was a long journey.
** Remote work. Desk and computer. 
** I'm gonna set up a basic room for him, we'll build something together.
** Driving up here.
** Ready anytime, but maybe as late as end of Feb.
** Eviction prediction, NY
* Try To Take Over The World
* Fireman Time! x3
* //House of Cards// + Workin' on Room 
* Sleep by 6:15
* Woke at 2
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Two Salesmen simultaneously.
** Bounced between them and my offspring. 
*** Both of my offspring (maybe everyone?) are paying technical debts. Neither are pushing hard enough. Not fun with me.
** Interesting to talk about my [[monster]] and [[ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱]] with both. They were polite and said they liked my music.
* Danny the Solar Salesman
** There is a program designed to test the house and install insulation. 
*** He's not allowed to talk about it (given his employers). 
*** Unfortunately, looking into it, we make just a couple thousand too much for the help. 
** Doesn't actually take us off the grid, especially since it feeds power back into the grid. 
*** It appears they might only be able to do 75% by regulation, and they eat the costs of generating too much and if they don't deliver the power they claimed to have, they pay for that. Curious. 
**** Looked on our power bill, and we are paying to enable others to have solar. Interesting. 
*** Battery not included. 
** We've not actually lived here for a full month, so our electric bill is not the indicator he needs. Unfortunately, that information is necessary for guessing what should be installed.
*** My goal is to tip the scale into being hedged-conservative in our next meeting. I meet his boss, possibly.
** I made him giggle after I interrogated him, stood up, said "I'm on board," and walked away to serve the other carbon-based life units in my home while my wife attended to this feller.
** One selling point was virtue signaling, had to warn me that it probably wouldn't be on the front of the house (which is a deal-breaker for some). 
** Hardware isn't ours, stipulations on liability. 
** He's obviously very new to the job, and it's obvious he's been struggling financially this year. It's been hell for him. 
** He talked to me about reading for a while (better than me). Walked me through his phone (I'm looking away until he commands my attention; he's showing me more than he knows he is showing me). Dude is cool. Has a 22yo son. 
** Gave him my information. `/salute`. 
*** Anything, sir. HMU.
* Dave the Capitalist
** Had to work on the wifi object. Next time they come back, I'm just gonna have them take it and refund us. They said our gauge isn't going to work enough (I'll test and see, I suggest it will), but it's been consistent and I don't have to walk through multiple networks (nor have this device on mine) to see something that my analog device does well. 
*** Refills have to be scheduled, and I don't need the reminder likely. Quarter tank is where we'll do it, I think.
** I have my doubts about maintenance, but I need an expert's advice (and it's not easy to find experts for these old boilers).
*** I won't be going for another maintenance now that I see it. We will have to replace in the next decade (and perhaps much sooner). 
** Talked about trades, school, his daughters, history of his company, life, shows, his views on China, etc. 
*** He was surprised to find I was younger than him. I look absolutely ancient. Could pass for 50 easy.
** He's not a good person. I should not be surprised. Niceness is a lie most of the time, including the niceness of disgust at questioning the apparent kindness of niceness.
*** Explored his view. Lay it bare before me. I have predictions about what those words mean. Selfish and incoherent, neither of which he's ashamed of at all. He's not incapably dumb, just evil.
** I can do the cleaning of the blocks and chimney, and the teardown didn't seem necessary enough. At least we have reason to believe it is in good shape, a second inspection price.
** He had a surprising amount of specialized equipment; he prided himself on being one of the best in the area. I admire how he wanted to make it easy on himself in the future. 
** Old parts got replaced, and guestimates + advice on future projects. 
*** Not sure if I need to get permits for fixing up the attic. 
*** I'm not the first person who wanted to make an enclosure, but it won't get enough oxygen without mechanically pumping in from the outside (and we also aren't even technically up to code, but he says the combustion is fine according to his instruments). Gave me reasons not to do it. 
*** Said he thinks I should consider building most of it on my own, but the heater itself needs an expert just like my electrical panel.
*** Suggested electrical heating for the attic instead. Fascinating choice given his line of work.
*** AC would be incredibly expensive to build, and window units appear like a better option, imho. 
*** He's not worried about the clog or discoloration on the radiators because they heat. Hrm.
* Taskmaster
** Lawd, technical debt is hittin' hard. Must pay it now before the semester starts. Gonna take an extra week, hope it lands.
** A moment where my son broke down, and we just hugged. Thought about it. I appreciate that he works so hard to be constructive even when it feels hopeless. That is such a hard lesson to learn. He will be a much better man than I am. 
* ⁸Δ⁸
** I've not been pooping as often or as much. Hrm.
* //Skintime//->Fireman Time!
* Shopping @ W-Entity
** Party goods. We even got candy. 
** Hope was our cashier. I made her laugh twice. Turn the silly stupid ~~on~~ up and voila, almost likable. 
*** She didn't seem beat down. People coming to her for things. 
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Offspring have not accomplished the goals, so we are lowering the bars and prioritizing. Daughter decided I was right about a few things; that's a good sign sometimes. Hard to give things up. I know. //Lawd, I know//.
*** My daughter is annoyed by my existence. It continues, many times a day. It is expensive to interact with me, even in the least of things. Glad we can still eat together.
** Muffalettas, water
** [[MTG]]
*** Son's MUC vs Belcher: 
**** Thought about the matchup while we ate our food.
**** Mox FoWed but ESG->Tinder into 6 Storm EtW. He did everything right (including mulling). Turn away from Wish->Echo.
**** Petal FoWed but SSG->Belch->Taiga@6, never recovered, completely locked out.
*** Games are speeding up, and he's mulling more thoroughly, it's compacting, we scoop earlier now (an acknowledgement and demonstration of respect) and in agreement on why. 
*** I [[like]] that he owns the cards. He goes to his room to get them every time we play. He's been thinking about the physical cards.
**** Once we hit digital, it will be another world. 2-in-1s might actually make it fun. Could be a game we play just to get each other in the same room or connection, a shield or apparent reason, an ability to not say anything of substance. But, for now, there are still many lessons to learn in this game.
* Sleep by 10
** It just hit me.

!! [[Computer Musings]] & [[Realpolitik Speculation]]:

Interesting following Aether's development, and moreso watching a lot of freespeech-oriented platforms bending to the will of the capitalists. There's a migration again. I [[hope]] Aether will continue to grow here, even if the moderation, trust, and data-ownership models aren't even close to ready. Decentralizing is really hard, but this one is ahead the curve. It's easy to be blind to the whole on that network, even with it having fewer than a thousand active participants. It's much closer to the kind of tool I'd be willing to map TW5-Bob onto for commenting and auto-posting.

Look at McConnell's attempt to leverage the stimulus bill: that is what the capitalist seeks plainly. Both are strictly about information [[power]] (even if it were merely a symbol and a joke). The big boys in that market win because they have the capital to fight in the legal system, a dialectical gladiator pit that on average works toward bleeding everyone else of their political voice.
