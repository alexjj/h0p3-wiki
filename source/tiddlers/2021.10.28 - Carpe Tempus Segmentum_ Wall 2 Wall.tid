title: 2021.10.28 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Wall 2 Wall

Woke at 9. Push bricks. [[Morning Routine]]. Leftover cowpot. [[TTTOTW]]. [[ASK]] is still sleeping hard. Good. Decades of fucked up sleep, gonna take a long time to repair it and pay the debt. Yesterday, I accidentally bumped into the coffee table and made a loud noise, and she says it was the first time she's been woken from sleep without the PTSD reaction. `/thumbs-up`. Safety first.

Hugs'n'bugs. They are wasting their time. It's theirs to waste. Shitty part of being a dad. At least I get to be with them. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time!<<ref "f">> Half-shower. [[TTTOTW]]. Bagel and toast, my son joined me, but not my daughter. His room smells like teenage boy.<<ref "c">> [[TTTOTW]]. Chats with [[T-Money]], including a dating profile he wrote up for [[Killcoin]]. Confirmed the validity of our plan for the garage-basement floor fix. 

[[ASK]] laid down on the floor, and I joined her as we planned out how we wanted to work on it today. Chats with [[5c0ut]] about someone screaming at him at work. =/.

Shopping @ Home Depot with [[5c0ut]] and [[ASK]]. Got in there, someone immediately tried selling me solar, and I'm being ultra-polite with slow counterpoints (I don't know why he thought I was going to be convinced). [[ASK]] watches it unfold for 20 seconds and says, "do you need me to rescue you here?...you already said, no." lmao. The best. [[ASK]] is pretty hilarious the way she just walks up to people and starts talking with a special kind of boldness too. Pixie IDGAF. One lady was clearly amused by our presence. [[ASK]] wants a dark bluish grey for the floor (sounds like some glitter too, but I won't be doing the walls). We grabbed the basic goods for applying a smooth, gently concave-curved concrete we need for a more reasonable, healed floor. 

Setting up my laptop for her to use, getting a start on TW in earnest now (running into many bugs on Windows, again). My son used a wire brush to prepare the floor, we swept several times, mopped, and then tried to keep it damp (still had to continue adding water through the process: and, we've been lacking spray bottles, unfortunately...cannot find my special glass one, and I will never lend it out again, woman :P). It was imperfect, but not awful. This might take more than one pass, and I'm glad we have time (may need more of this specialized though inexpensive concrete). My daughter moved stuff up to the attic with deep unhappiness, and I finished off the organization of our old emergency food supplies. We have a working tool and pantry area again. She went on to work on [[Rust]] (with a considerably better attitude, knowing everything I think about these matters, of course<<ref "a">>). 

Spent time looking around the house, thinking about [[ASK]]s {[[Dreams]]} for gardening. It's a BFD for her. I think the other adults will enjoy this process far more than I do. Beyond that it makes others happy, just for me, I'd be happy with limited mowing, that magnolia tree, no Japanese Knotweed destroying our foundation, no dangers to persons (glass and yellow jackets included), and any possible watermelons (`/sniff`).<<ref "if">>

//The Walk// with [[ASK]]. Like [[k0sh3k]], interested in naming the fauna. We stopped many times to look at random things, much like the store. I talked about each house we passed by as best I knew. Pointed out the spot we need to get through to get to the forest area closeby. We made it to Elaine's house before she was out of energy, so we headed back.

[[TTTOTW]] with [[5c0ut]] and [[ASK]] chillin downstairs. Lots of people poppin in and out. My wife is practicing her bowed psaltery instead of Greek (good for you, girl). Eventually, my window came.

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. She's right that I may be allergic to my toys (I want to exaggerate about how bad that would be to my eyes, but I will not harm myself beyond accepting the allergic reaction :P). One day, she'll figure out that web seminars are a waste of time in enough cases that they should almost never be pursued. Neurologist listened well, and finally the treatment she has needed for a very long time (one that insurance has never been willing to pay for) may be coming! Extremely exciting. It could profoundly change our lives. I'm glad she never gave up.

[[Family Gathering]] downstairs. It's packed, 6 peeps. It's difficult to pack any more into [[The Den]] unless my bed gets raised up off the floor or we sit on the floor some. Offspring made pizza, salad (with peppers, unfortunately; this is going to be something I forget a thousand times), some apple slices, and waffle fries. We watched the Trachtenberg episode of //House// (good god is she hawt).

[[ASK]]ing amd warrening for hours, deep into philosophy and many personal topics. I actually needed the chalktable because I couldn't hold everything at once, and I was going to lose the map.
