[4:39 AM] h0p3: I like it. I'm surprised.
[4:41 AM] chameleon: Good ol' wet-ass p-word
[4:41 AM] chameleon: Wii memes are just generally hilarious
[4:42 AM] h0p3: I need to collect these naughty songs, lol.
[4:43 AM] h0p3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq-Ru6kQhE4, and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17i3bKKI4M0

[4:52 AM] chameleon: I'm trying to learn a slightly more innocent song myself
[4:52 AM] chameleon: Scarlet begonias
[4:52 AM] chameleon: A mixolydian ditty with some tricky partial chord grooves
[4:53 AM] chameleon: All at the 7th and 5th fret area =w=.
[4:53 AM] h0p3: Relaxing to listen to, probably not relaxing to play until you've mastered it.
[4:54 AM] chameleon: Yup!
[4:54 AM] chameleon: Well, it's a fine song to learn to go along with my other grateful dead repetoire
[4:55 AM] chameleon: (I can already play franklin's tower, which is a much easier song)
