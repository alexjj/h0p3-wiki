Okay, so, in honor of my teacher, maybe one of the skills I must acquire is becoming an NPC. A fanatical greybot jester tank: in our postmodern target practice, throw your tomatoes at me instead of [[others]], I will wear them like armor over my meat curtains. I wish I knew how to tell people they hold my heart in their hands. Sir [[DeathOfRobinhood]] is a grandmaster of it too, and it shows in his humble approach.

One of the interesting parts about my relationships is watching them fade into silence on some topics. I'm pretty sure we both know what's happening. Lemme tellya (and I doubt I need to): ego knows ego, my ninja. I don't write the //About// sections of person pages anymore. For a rainy day if ever. I prefer to keep doors open and let it be unwritten. I doubt I will master the art of the unsaid.

`/walloftext`. Kuh-thol-ih-kos? I [[like]] your [[name]]. It reminds me of something. I know how punchable my face is. Did I rub you the wrong way? Oh, sorry. I do that sometimes. Ummm. Spamexaminator, Reporting For Duty: did you find the nazi? within? are you happily married? doesn't seem like it. =(. do you think it's fake? I can see why. Yes, I am a househusband. That thing you would //kill// for (don't beat yourself up about it either there buddy, okay?). Do you like to garner affection from plebbitors? You seem too ironic to be sincere. I think I know what you mean when you say you joined the air force. `/salute`. <3. I'm sorry you were a huge fuckup in class (I definitely appreciate not being a fan of the educations most people receive) and then continued to fuck up by joining the US military-industrial-complex (apparently). Hi, there. I'm h0p3. It's an honor to meet you. What do you think about trains? I'm schizo-autistic. How about you? I like your fascination with trucks. Do you ever get high, soldier? C'mon. You can tell me. I'm no one. Unlike [[DrDeezee]], you obviously know very little about the nature of employment, including your own. Do you think yours is a malicious ignorance? I'm trying to see the good in you, nomad. Be a lamp unto my feet, dear one. Show me the way. I'm here for all the higher animals, Leviathans and Turtles too. I'm interested in what you understand about automation. It sounds like you have some experience worth talking about. At least for the forseeable future, I agree that select humans will tend to be in charge of most everything, but this is a prediction not a prescription. Obviously, I'm not a fan. I'm here to decentralize [[power]]. How about you, soldier? What do you mean by "keep being a baby back bitch"? You have all these phrases I just don't understand, soldier. That a person of your enormous status has reached out to hate me fills me with joy. I feel like I'm on the right path when I see your response. Thank you. Yes, I do read my enemies.

Only well-rounded in the sense that I'm fat, imma go out ~~fightin~~ eatin, my ninja.

Seeking distributed-computational max-entropy reinforcement hyperlearners, mindfuck [[salience]] filters of [[The Great Human Conversation]], neotenizing mania-activators who combine inputs and outputs in bizarre ways, manic space mutant pixie dream aggregators, and disinhibiting mere-presentist-norm transcendence facilitators. <3. I'd like some flattering fries to go with this delicious non-mere word salad too, please.
