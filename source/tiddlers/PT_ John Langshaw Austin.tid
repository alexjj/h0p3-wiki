* Ordinary language embodies the inherited experience and acumen of many generations; it is not the last word, but the first word.
* For the objects of perception, the reality-appearance duality is misconceived; the term "real" has many different uses.
* The application of the positive term (reality, freedom, etc.) depends on its negative term, which is itself contextual.
* The search for absolute certainty is both fruitless and unwanted.
* Because a belief is about something, its truth is independent of the fact that it is believed; it must be possible for the thinker to be mistaken.
* What is evidence for what is always contextual; there is no limit to the kinds of evidence that might turn out to be relevant.
* There can't be a theory providing an abstract recipe for the totality of evidence for a particular claim.
* In skeptical arguments we should locate our doubts only in specific contexts of inquiry.
* Utterances are not always descriptions; hey can be "performatives" in which we do things with words (promises, threats, etc.).
* Three types of speech act: locutionary (what I say), illocutionary (what I do in saying that), and perlocutionary (what effect it has on the listener).
* Claims to knowledge ("I know that S is P") can also be performatives where we give others our authority (for saying that S is P).
