<<<
Woke at 1. Not nothing, but not enough. Rumination, meditation. //Skintime// with my sympaticon and //Community//. Massage. [[D2]] with my sympaticon while I ate leftovers (we should do kielbasa every fucking week). Mi amor was up, and she's in good spirits. =). She's been quite excited to teach today.

//The Walk// with my sympaticon at sunrise. 

Chilled a bit with mi amor (I'm glad her Sundays can be relaxing). Final push in [[D2]] to the ancients. //Community//. Put my sympaticon to couch. Sleep by 10?

[[Family Time]] @ 2:30. [[k0sh3k]], [[j3d1h]], [[1uxb0x]] started without the rest of us (on a clock today), allowing us to sleep. Woke and joined just in time. It's pretty simple these days.

Shopping @ Home Depot with my sympaticon. We found the tree she has wanted all along, a "Weeping Pussy Willow" (all in favor of the name) and stepping stones for her [[garden]]ing.

//Sherlock// wedding episode. Worked on syncs and set up [[m10]] again (as my daughter is done with this [[beautiful]] machine, as it were) with the KVM. Forget virtualization then. Both my offspring demolished the episode afterward. XD.

Son turned me down for playing.<<ref "s">> `/sigh`. //Skintime// with my sympaticon. She's feeling down. Put mi amor to bed. [[D2]] with [[ASK]] while finishing the kielbasa leftovers.<<ref "l">> Cleared Baal. Practice with FCR will make it clearer what the sorc does over time, especially post Insight+ES. Unfortunately, since I do most of the clearing, the level gap has widened considerably. We're on the edge of being unable to level together, at the 10 level limit. <5 is split evenly. NeckRomancer is 32, a +1Nec Wand is worse than his +3CE,+2SM,+2RS white, and I don't see any craftable or buyable gear upgrades without [[luck]] at this point.<<ref "i">> Not playing in windowed mode on a 42" screen two feet away from me is awkward, but I'm enjoying it so far. Put my sympaticon to bed. Sleep by 11?

Woke at 1. Alrighty. Meditation. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Dark Chocolate. Chat with [[Variety Creepy]].

She's up, awake, weird dreams, and getting ready for the day. Cheese. 

My sympaticon was awake, maybe a bit grumpy in her interpretation and argumentation, but doing her best to be careful with her words and feelings. Tolerance break is quite difficult for her, compounding factor. May she be kind to herself and find the sleep she needs. Set up her machines, fixed her up with //Ender's Game// audiobook and epub, and demonstrated Bob is working from all devices.

//Skintime// with my sympaticon + //Community//. Sleep by 7?

Woke at 1:30. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. 

A flash.

Offspring came down to [[The Den]] to play. Unfortunately, my son's pally is too far behind for NeckRomancer to level with him, and I needed two levels on the sorc (Sugar) before [[ASK]] could join us. She spiraled off instead of joining us when we could. Wolf is on her back, dark lenses, absolutist language with amplified negativity. It's painful to be honest, including recognizing elements of [[hope]], in that space. My son learned plenty as we played together, and we eventually got to A3. He's got his [[D2]] game files synced between his devices, so he was able to host (timed out on Duriel). Sugar has +3FB Leaf, Stealth, and borrowed some nec gear. She hits like a truck. The necromancer is still the only viable tank we've got, essentially, but it's hard to do without gear on pally, at the very least.

Chilled with my sympaticon as she cooked a small meal (she offered to cook for us, but no takers).

//Inform the Men!// Shower of the gods!

Found [[ASK]] sitting on the porch, hadn't touched her food. Sat with her while she ate her udon noodles and engineered orange chicken (nifty). Held hands and talked. Planned more of the [[garden]].

Careful dialectics with my sympaticon. I'm doing my best to avoid arguing, as it is costly to make some kinds of moves with me in the long-run. I know when I'm in pain, it is often best to leave me alone. //Skintime// with my sympaticon. //HEIST - Who Stole The American Dream//. Back to vaping for her, I think. Zlam may be next.

Went to cook with my offspring, but my daughter requested to do it with just her brother. Okay. Bit more time with mi amor and my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]].

[[Family Gathering]] was a shining light. We had salad and fancy fish sticks. [[ASK]] had earlier prepared a special dark chocolate (95%, then diluted) fudge with a reduced orange marmalade and salt on top. Ginger drank. Pornstar episode of //House//. The plunge cometh.

Put my sympaticon to bed. Pushed brix. Put mi amor to bed. Joked with off my offspring. [[TTTOTW]].

Lightning & Thunder 

Sleep by 11?
