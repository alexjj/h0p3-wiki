*** As it was predicted. I am obviously opposed to this. The normative problem of freespeech is an incredibly expensive topic to speak about wisely.

*** The plague is only beginning. I wish everyone had a wiki. I know instantly I'm thinking about+from a genuine person when I read what my hypertext friends have to say. That still doesn't defeat [[Memetic Warfare]], but it's a damned good start.
*** Us too, our government engages in wargames devoted to defeating our own revolutions: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6936805-JLASS-Document.html

* Think About It

*** Actually, I meet very few people who really believe in our obligations to radical democracy (could you imagine if I actually attempted to be evil? I know just how effectively evil I could be, so it's probably easier for me to accept the necessity of democracy). Even most self-proclaimed leftists I know give up on it.

*** It's Forbes. Presumably, this is Redscare exploitation. I say that as someone who agrees with the argument.
