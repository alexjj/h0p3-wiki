I know dealing with me is often expensive for my interlocutors, and I'm [[grateful]] that you continue to speak with me and put your skin in the non-mere game. Engaging in [[good]] [[faith]] conversations with you is a sacrament to me. It's an important part of high-functioning [[intimacy]]. You're obviously brilliant, so this is quite an opportunity for someone like myself: a beginner. I'll do my best to think carefully about what you have to say.


> We can use this email thread for communication.

[[Awe]]some. Eventually we may find it useful to read from my ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 (one day I may move to speaking my half of the conversation from it), as I tend to [[link]] often. I'll warn you that I'm a long-winded person, so please ignore any of the threads you wish and pick out what matters for us. I rely upon your judgment.


> https://philosopher.life/ does not seem have your personal background.

Hrm. Well, I suppose it must be in here somewhere, I'm a thoroughly documented human being. Curiosity may be in order. Depending on your needs, I'll agree it may be difficult to find what you are looking for. I'll bet 80% of the information you're looking for can be found in 1-2 clicks or a search.<<ref "b">> Understanding my background and gibberish requires quite an investment of time (I understand you're an extremely busy person, as evidenced by your [[calendar]]<<ref "c">>). In any case, feel free to ask questions, and I'll do what I can to answer or point you the way. 

I can rehearse a tailored elevator speech of who I am for you here. I'm a loser who reads and writes during most of the day and night in his basement, like a bottomfeeder (except to spend time with his family or manage household affairs). Like [[you|Be A Good Dad]], I have two children, [[1uxb0x]] and [[j3d1h]]. You and I [[share]] some similar tastes in [[vidya]] [[games]]. I have an informal ~~background in~~ fascination with [[computing]] (I'm a noob who uses Arch Linux<<ref "al">>), and I'm excited by some of the work you do. I have a formal background in analytic philosophy.<<ref "g">> Though you have obviously met many people from many walks of life, I suggest that you should assume I have been conditioned by Western traditions in a way you don't encounter often (I'm a 4eak), and I appreciate your willingness to [[wrestle]] with my [[bias]]. I've been a teacher in many contexts, including some years in Thailand (a country deeply shaped by China's great history). I am extremely concerned with the unjustified centralization of [[power]], and I think the proletariat are surrounded by enemies (including themselves). Part of my vocation is openly speaking with people about many hard problems we face.


> One reason I shared mine, was that similar background helps tailor the communication.

I strongly agree to this claim, and that is part of why I [[shared]] mine with you. [[Public Self-Modeling]] can be crucial for enabling accelerated cooperation and targeted messages. Thinking about who you are given material you have produced allows me to empathize with you and attempt to build fitting bridges between us. I'm autistic, so it may not be so easy for either of us. I am [[hope]]ful though, and I'm thankful for your patience and willingness to tailor your writing to me. Please say what you want to say however you want to say it, and feel free to take as long as you need to respond (even if it requires years).


> Feel free to send me any questions any time, I'll be happy to provide my thoughts.

Well, I have two right now: why do you feel one has to define the words [[justice]] and [[morality|The Right]] by oneself? Moreover, why should one think (rather than simply feel) so? If necessary, please let me know if these questions are part of the problem you are pointing out or explicitly aiming to avoid in your work.


> Regarding China, you can find various materials that should bring a more complete picture.

I am a novice and a retard who has too many things to learn all at once. I am flooded, never sure what's important enough. My [[Link Log]] may provide some evidence of my consumption, but I barely trust what I have as it is. I never have a complete or coherent enough picture. Despite spending a considerable amount of time trying to understand politics, I must confess, I'm still radically ignorant. I am a work in progress, my friend. I'm honored to meet people, including you, who can help me understand the world better.

Many experts I encounter believe there are some conversations that only maybe 50 people on the planet can fully participate in (for various reasons). By that standard, it's very easy to find misleading materials, and it can be difficult to find (let alone enter) fitting conversations among those who have justified perspectives. Who should I [[trust]] on this immense topic, and why?


> The first step is to be comfortable to read the propaganda materials from CCP and the so-called "pro-China" sources.

This is an excellent point. It is my opinion that in some nations, the people have grown up understanding they are reading propaganda, and some people may grow immunized to it, capable of calmy deconstructing and inferring much about what it means, what is implied, and why it was said. I can only imagine you are quite skilled in this practice, and I ask you to forgive my naivety and backwards conditioning. I [[hope]] to learn this [[Straussian]] [[art]].

What does it mean to be fittingly comfortable in reading materials from these sources? What do you think of these sources? How do you think about American propaganda? What other countries do you study like this? For the sake of political literacy, is it ever more worthwhile to focus on non-mainstream materials? I feel like it's often not worth my time to wade through all of the propaganda I find, but instead rely upon feeds of others who feed upon all the feeds to curate and moderate for me what is worth my time.


> They generally are showing a different perspective than the western ones.

I'm committed to [[Finding The Other|Find The Other]]. Consuming a broad media diet seems to be one's epistemic duty as a citizen of [[Humanity]], especially in the 21st Century.<<ref "w">> As we are on this crucial topic: do you believe that all perspectives are equal? Why?


> Behind this suggestion, the key is to gradually recognize the deep root of western value system, and in which parts they differ from a Chinese one.

I think it would be fair to say I'm interested in this problem. I ask you to be technical with me here where you can, and where you can't, I'm happy to consider what you can juice from your gut instincts. You cannot elaborate too much here for my tastes, and, yes, I want your unguarded opinion wherever you can spare it.


> The process hopefully can lead to a mental framework that is deeper than the usual democracy vs. authoritarian, freedom vs. oppression.

I can see your underappreciated and arguably unpopular work on HN concerning busting these dichotomies and more.<<ref "y">> I admire how you labor to show us there is more to the story than these mental frameworks. I respect that you are seeking fitting processes for coming to understand what is most [[salient]] about our species.


> If you want some recommendations about the writings, videos etc from non-western sources, I could provide youtube channels, books, and online articles.

Absolutely. I beg you! I also ask for people I need to follow and forum feeds I should attempt to consume. Though I am somewhat curious about Chinese languages ([[中国语录]]<<ref "f">>), I'm in need of English because I am ignorant and I have a pervasive developmental disorder of some kind: my ability to learn other languages is deeply flawed (as you can tell: I don't talk right). I recognize that translations (and which things are selected for translation) come with their own [[bias]]es. There's also so much information out there that I'm reliant upon your expertise to cut through noise to find the signal. What do you think counts as epistemically authoritative or at least required consumption for someone in my shoes? I'll take as many links and sources as you are generously willing to provide. 


> But I usually refrain from that, because it shows a certain embedded personal view.

That reminds me of [[Embodied Cognition]]. Why do you think you ought refrain from showing a certain embedded personal view? I am confused, as I think much (if not all) of your writing does precisely that. Should I not celebrate and carefully consider your embedded personal view? Are these not keys to interpreting what you have to say? I admire that pursuit of objectivity, considerably. This seems like a hard problem, and I ask for your guidance in understanding it.


> And I think the most important thing of learning new things is the ability to lower one's mental defense, but at the same time has the intellectual fortitude to maintain a good independent view. It's like walking in dark, with an inner sense of direction. 

That seems like quite a fine line to walk. I must admit that my intuitions, conditioned responses, and inner sense of direction are often wrong. I am regularly searching for the [[light|ridtyawtr]]. I'm quite interested in what makes for a [[good]] independent view. Too often I am blind as I wander the desert. I am often dependent upon [[others]] to sense, interpret, and understand The World, even in only minimal senses in most cases. Lowering my shields to be fittingly open and to trust [[others]] can be hard work, but I think it's necessary to make progress.


> It's best if one could start searching by oneself.

This is the second time you have picked this out. Perhaps it merits some [[wrestling]]. 

You are a learned person. You know what it means to devote yourself to understanding The World, especially your work. You will agree that often having the right master or teacher enables one to become proficient in a given practice more reliably and with greater speed than doing it by oneself. I take us to be examining something like a [[hyperobject|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Morton#Hyperobjects]] here, where there are no experts who can know even most of what matters. 

I will agree that there are many places in life in which we are lost in the desert by ourselves, where even, conceptually, no one can [[help]] us. 

I'm considering combing through your HN account to comment and ask questions. I began doing so, but then realized I should wait since that might be more work than you want to put in here. You'll have to guide me as to how much time and energy you want to spend speaking with a madman. Thank you for hearing me.
