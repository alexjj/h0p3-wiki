title: 2020.09.15 - Prompted Introspection: Food in Fridge

!! If I looked into your fridge right now, what would I find?

It's not identical to [[2020.08.15 - Prompted Introspection: Fridge]], and considering how food is a universal concern for homo sapiens, I think this particular question is a keeper.

We just went shopping yesterday for refrigerated supplies. I'm not itemizing every detail because I'm lazy. I know the following: half a watermelon, milk, coffee, tea, lemonade, pickles, kimchi, many types of peppers, lettuce, carrots, brussel sprouts, kiwi, strawberries, hummus, salad dressing, olives, sausage, cheese, bacon, eggs, yogurt, fruit preserves, butter, a bottle of water, vanilla, and lemon juice. We are fortunate to have so much.
