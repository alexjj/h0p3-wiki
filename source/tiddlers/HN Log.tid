> Well first things first. Americans are mostly 'rich'. There's a political ploy about the 'disappearing' middle class but it's because americans became rich. Investment in education killed the 'middle class' by making them rich. Take this for example: https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/07/09/how-americans-compare-with-the-global-middle-class/

> Yes there are many americans who have poor as a mindset. 88% of americans were upper middle or high income. The amount of americans with a poor mindset is very low. As Dave Chapelle jokes, "You're not poor, poor is a mentality. The mentality that nobody recovers from. you're broke."

> So getting back to the question, say you're poor or low income. These economic problems are not your concern at all. Your concern is breaking the mentality.

> You need to learn abundance and confidence. Break the poor thought. The problem or why Dave chapelle says you rarely escape being poor is that the poor mentality is hostile toward this idea.

If any, what is your advice for poor and middle class Americans?

My TW: https://philosopher.life/

I've found having it all in a single html file tends to makes it easy to survive on a lot of different kinds of networks, and I like that the larger context of the site is automatically attached to any particular part of it (which is invaluable for my work).

> Hi, not currently, myself I‚Äôm actually in the latter category and don‚Äôt have a strong identity online (even as I semi-envy those who do, as it seems like it could provide tangible long-term benefits).

>I don‚Äôt like the phrasing of ‚Äúowning the means of production‚Äù‚Äîno matter where you express your thoughts, presumably you will always own those particular means of production‚Äîbut agreed on distribution. Still, if one is thinking in terms of ‚Äúdistribution‚Äù and ‚Äúpublishing‚Äù with regards to their thoughts or writing, one definitely leans towards a platform, be that microblogging or something else; for others this is not even a problem as they rather seek exchange of ideas or the feeling of belonging.

> The point about playing with the limits of a medium is appreciated. I suspect if this problem is tackled with an engineering/experimental mindset, rather than identity mindset, interesting results could be achieved.

(I don‚Äôt mean sociopathy in a bad sense‚ÄîI myself follow a few accounts, many anonymous, who do this kind of explorative posting and I enjoy it a lot.

In this sense, a community provides a shared framework that reduces the chance of this misunderstanding, which could be appealing to some.

Hello. =). Besides this account, what are some places where I could see how you more systematically think? I'd like to add to your list the claim that there's more to be said for owning the means of production (including distribution) and the types of autonomy that arise in constructing (and reconstructing) the limits of the medium in which one engages in signaling.

Many of these tools and centralized platforms automate most of the process (encouraging even structural uniformity), and that's quite convenient in many cases. I think most people would be surprised what kinds of communities can arise from humble links and by-hand human convention even on a read-only network (where we can only write to our own node).

I can appreciate this desire. Printing my website is basically out of the question at this point. I rely upon people thinking it worthwhile to keep a copy, and I make it fairly easy for people to do so. I distribute on a number of networks, I offer a number of snapshot archives (e.g. philosopher.life), and I make it easy to download a complete copy of the entire site (https://philosopher.life/#Readme), as it's just a single html file. I do ask family and friends to see it as a book they will keep in their libraries, and I keep it very small, almost pure text (I don't want it to be any further a burden than it already is). Some store it on a thumbdrive or even keep it as an e-mail attachment. And, that it is nearly pure text is something that I think is exceptionally useful for this problem, as even if there aren't browsers that will be able to render it (that would be sad), there may be tools that can at least read the source (and, in a way, the site is meant to be somewhat readable from source, though it requires some motivation). I also enjoy the knowledge that there are random copies out there sitting on hard drives. I think it's gonna take some luck too.

I can relay his three best pieces of advice, though, all of which he related to me around the time I went to college.

> 1. Don't take a course where the professor wrote the book. If they knew any way to explain the material, they put it in the book, and won't be able to help you more than that.

> 2. People get excited about all sorts of things, and if you're reasonably friendly and available they will invite you to everything. That's not bad in itself, but you need to be selective about what you go to, or else you'll find that you never did the things that you needed to do, just the ones that you wanted to do.

> 3. There are lots of reversible mistakes, and others that are disastrous to try to recover from. Try to recognize your mistakes and back out of them before you hit the disaster point. Marriage is easily but painfully reversible until you have kids; then it's a disaster.

I'm [[grateful|https://philosopher.life/#Gratitude]] that GPG exists; we'd be lost without it. I don't want to use GPG, and I only use it when I'm forced to use it. There's tons of reasons to use public key cryptography though; it's hardly correctly integrated into our lives. I definitely want a world in which we relatively equally own the means of production, including the keys to our justified kingdoms. A yubikey is really waiting on the rest of the ecosystem to systematically adapt (and, I have no idea if or when that will occur, and I'm relatively pessimistic that it would be used wisely). I want to see yubikey related technologies dedicated to helping the global poor, especially in automating both liquid representation and redistributions of wealth (itself part of the problem of representation of our competing desires and theories of [[The Good|https://philosopher.life/#The%20Good]]).

I ran my own ghetto experiment. Despite resisting (I'm still not going to install it on mobile), it was Plebbit that brought me to Tiktok. Without having visited Tiktok, I've seen thousands of tiktoks that were scraped out and hosted on other platforms. Over the course of the year, I collected well over a hundred videos.

    `https://philosopher.life/#:[search[tiktok.com]tag[Link%20Log]]`

I went back to the source for each of these and started Liking them. I'd check every so often to see if the "For You" feed improved. It did improve, considerably, but it still doesn't beat the signal-to-noise ratio of having humans pick them out for me. I can scroll through 200 videos on Tiktok and not find a single video worth a Like (I've found one so far from Tiktok's recommendations, and that was from a channel of a video I had previously liked). Perhaps I've misused the algorithm that does the real work for picking out content that will capture my attention, but I'm pretty disappointed.

> This might not be relevant to you, but in case my braindump may spark a serious conversation: //mere// virtue signaling is closer (but still not quite right). Part of the problem is that signaling (and, the more I look at this word, the more problematic it becomes, as I'm not sure what doesn't count in at least one's lightcone), virtuous or otherwise, need not be intended; agents can accidentally give away information. The virtuous agent may signal, and their signals may be both virtuous and appear otherwise to the vicious and virtuous alike. Part of the problem with the phrase "virtue signaling" is that there's a positivistic definition of the concept, but there are also justified manners in which to engage in that practice. Virtue signaling need not be fake or reduced to appearance (assuming we set aside the problem of representing a thing-in-itself). The virtuous agent may also perform or signal knowing they are signaling, and they may do so in virtue of performance. Maybe "Vicious Virtue-Signaling" is more appropriate. There are likely many attempts to label this thing we're worried about. This strikes me as the closest answer: when one aims to signal one's goodness in a deceptive manner that treats the other (including one's future self) as mere means, one has engaged in immoral or vicious virtue-signaling.

Virtue signaling.

I'm not stealing anything by instructing my computer not to run code against my consent. No one is entitled to my CPU time. Least of all are advertisers.
Also, the store isn't freakishly stalking me and noting down all my habits whilst sharing what it has collected with its friends, or indeed anyone who will buy the data.

Besides, candy is impossible to replicate in the same way that data is. Theft of physical objects is a materially different act from advert blocking and avoidance. I'm not obligated to view adverts in every public space because they fund the local government. I'm not denied access to the cinema because I arrive 10 minutes after the start time to avoid the adverts. Or back in the day when I taped TV shows and fast-forwarded the adverts, had I a responsibility to view them?

They're useless noise that contribute no value to anyone beyond whoever pays for them, and therefore I find it a moral responsibility to limit my exposure to them and restrain the harm they do to others. And curiously, I am much more content and much less impulsive in my spending habits since I installed uBlock.

Shouting is easy, doing so isn't.
I gave up on trying to maintain forks of web browsers, because their extension API deliberately doesn't allow modifying response bodies. It's just impossible to maintain any fork of any browser because of the sheer amount of features that rely on JS APIs for websites and the amount of commits upstream.

Ad Blockers are just a dirty hack that completely relies on Chromium respecting the Content-Security-Policy headers for all domains. If Google decides to blocklist their own domains for HTTP header modifications, we're fucked. Quite literally.

That's the reason why I kinda started to build my own browser (without a rendering engine for now) that focusses on filtering, parsing, and peer-to-peer offloading traffic and sees itself as a mixture between web browser, scraper and proxy that can be used as a cache for others. It has the idea to act as a web filter service + a webview to render its UI rather than being a render engine and document engine. [1]

I hope that with this market niche there's a way to make this kind of effort sustainable for the future, because all other web browser fork projects I've seen so far are dying off due to no funding and too much work to maintain the codebase.

It's just not feasible to compete in the everday user's browser market. Lots of companies have tried, and lots of companies have failed.

I'm part of a think tank (not for or against Bitcoin) speculating on what, from an analytic/continental philosophy tradition. Stuff like: Universality and its species: The Market is the empty universal element that contains the Money Market (aka banks, hedge funds and day traders) but also its species of particulars that fail to be contained by the Money Market: the Real Economy. The Real Economy concerns the production, purchase and flow of goods and services within an economy. (Laclau). Crypto is the antagonism between the particular element (The Market) which hegemonizes universality and the element (the Real Economy) which, within this universality stands for what is excluded from it.

''''

>>> Bingo. You got it. `/salute`. Given sandboxing security features, it's too easy to balloon up too. I periodically have to restart the application (which incurs some costs on this external cognition process, unfortunately). Browsers aren't built for people like me (and the way standards maliciously churn qua Google doesn't inspire confidence in finding a long-term, meaningful solution), and I appreciate that it's seemingly a lot to ask. Btw, my name is h0p3. It's a pleasure to meet you. Thank you for your charitable response.

>> The frustrating thing about modern browsers is that none of them try to be good desktop citizens, for the lack of a better term. If you have 8 or 16 or 32 or 64 GB of memory, and you open enough tabs, your browser will eventually consume all of it, even though most browsers are perfectly capable of suspending unused tabs when they're under memory pressure. They simply don't register a problem until your memory is nearly gone.

>> If you have swap space, it's even worse, because there's not noticeable memory pressure until you've always consumed a good bit of your swap. So I frequently find myself in a situation where I start compiling something or launch a game, and have my computer immediately slow to a crawl. Check htop, and it's always the browser I have open, taking ~13 GB of memory and another 4 GB of swap. It's certainly true that "unused RAM is wasted RAM", but that only holds when you can reclaim low priority RAM when you need to launch something new. Browsers are really bad at doing that, so they sit rather uncomfortably next to the other programs on your desktop.

> It's not. I'm sorry. I'm regularly dumping 30GB into FF. There's nowhere else to go though. =/.

I am personally using a lots of browser extensions because of my dev job. I have switched some years ago to Chrome when it was faster than Firefox for a short moment. Now i consider going back because Chrome eats so much RAM there is little left for node.js and vscode. Even more with every extension installed. I had to disable bunch of these for that reason.

I know it is off topic. However, can anyone share info if Firefox is better at this point considering memory usage?

What feels like a big missed opportunity for Reddit is having a front-page without the low-quality subreddits. People often say to just never visit /r/popular because of all the garbage, but it's unfortunately the only way to discover subreddits when you‚Äôre not looking for anything in particular. Sure, if you know what you're looking for, it's pretty easy to find the appropriate subreddit. But if you just want to wander around, you have to sift through the terrible crap that shows up on /r/popular.
I'd love it if there was something that helped filter this content automatically. Currently I keep manually blocking these subreddits, which was a lot of work at first (my block list is currently ~200) but it's helped a lot.

I'm trying to solve this for myself actually by starting with filtering low-quality comments on Reddit and HN. I made a Chrome extension that helps me label comments as I read and stores them in Google Sheets. Then I use those labeled comments to train a custom NLP model that can categorize comments (good or bad, hide the comment if it's bad). So far, I'm spending most of my time trying to build a good dataset for my tastes. It's not too bad so far (~80-90% accuracy).

I can appreciate the appeal of that line of reasoning. It must factor into whatever is justified. That is a set of many hard problems, no doubt. It's also not a private space in many respects and to a significant degree. I suggest you know that too. I admire that you are concerned with what matters most about the truth of the matter.

My assumption is that the people in your life are lucky to know you. You probably help them with some technical problems that few others can handle as well as you can. I cannot say I know how to self-host in a way that works well enough. I am pretty awful with computers, but I do like 'em a lot, and I am interested in how you think about and use them. I have two offspring who must learn to be autonomous (in every sense of the word) wisely (it feels like I'm never sufficiently prepared for this task, and I doubt I ever will be).

>>>> Also, I wonder if the analogy, more hedged-conservatively-speaking, is strong but not perfect. It's hella good, I know that. There's a lot to flesh out in the claim that its //meant// to be very personal to you. I agree that my garden, for example, is exceptionally personal (and not just to me). I hope we all get to live in gardens among gardens. I'm not convinced they are necessarily meant to grow slowly, nor do I think each garden is meant to grow over a long long time. I will, however, agree that long-term growth is crucial to wielding it wisely in most cases, and, perhaps vacuously: the best of them grow at the fitting pace for the fitting duration. It is not clear that such gardens will (or even ought) inevitably get organized or reshuffled (or sometimes it turns out just to be details that get fleshed out), but I suggest the odds of these effects are surprisingly high in an actively maintained garden. Imho, there are countless mistakes that I must fix in my own gardening, and it's not easy to pick out what to solve first.

>>>> I am interested in what it means to say The Moral Law is something we need. It depends on what kinds of creatures we are and what purposes we're meant to serve, I suppose. At very least, I agree that we stand in relation to such a necessity, but we choose to bind ourselves to or with it as well. That contingency is part of the source of what makes us ends in ourselves (and I'm interested in the end-to-end principle there too). I suggest that the [[gfwiwcgws]], namely the good of the garden in this case, is not as egoistic, positivistic, or libertarianly neutral-appearing as personal preference, though I will agree our sensibilites and qualia are an irreducibly necessary part of computing what is ultimately good about it.

>>> I don't mean to criticise your work or be the typical nitpicking HN commenter that you see downvoted all the way to the bottom of the comments page.

I demonstrated to you that there is still a reasonable point to using an adblocker that still contacts an adserver. That's at least two claims you've trotted out that turned out to be unjustified.

>>>>> "The problem is not that people can use [a motorized vehicle] in a stupid way. People //are// using [motorized vehicles] in a stupid way." Note how my counterpoint clarifies how just because some people use a tool, be it a motorized vehicle or AdNauseam, in a way that is stupid doesn't mean that all uses of the tool are stupid. Using a motorized vehicle is not stupid in at least some cases, and the same is true of AdNauseam. Your thesis is overcommitted (try stating it differently).

>>>>> Perhaps you might try to argue about how the average use of the tool is harmful, but you've not given that argument either. I'm prepared to take you to task there too, of course.

>>>>> Note that you're ignoring multiple arguments I've made here. C'mon dude, do your due diligence, go ahead and walk through it line by line, charitably, please (just like I did for you). You might find your argument is substantially weaker when you actually try to address what I've said instead of sweeping it under the rug and repeating yourself.

>>>>> Let us assume for the sake of argument that using "full click through rate" is stupid (and, problematically, you've not established even that, and I've already given you a reason that it isn't necessarily stupid). There is at least one person who doesn't use the "full click through rate" for the sake of costing advertisers money, and this counts as a non-stupid and non-trivially valuable function that uBlock Origin does not provide (note that this wasn't the only reason I gave for the value of false clickthroughs). Thus, even if I granted that "full click through rate" use was stupid (and I obviously didn't), your thesis does not stand. There is a counterexample.

>>>>> You continue to offer an ad hominem attack on a strawmanned user, as though they represent all possible users and uses of this tool. Preference falsification is a weak aspect of the tool, and you're ignoring the strength of it. Have the integrity to look at the other reasons I've shown you, please. You might still want to argue that the reasons I've given you are stupid, but you've conveniently ignored addressing them instead. So far, at best, your argument is really against some users of the tool rather than the tool itself.

>>>>> Note, also, how using the tool stupidly (or even just ignorantly) to some degree does not imply it's stupid to use the tool. You need to provide a reason for us to think the former implies the latter, and you haven't.

So clever!'

>>> Hello. My name is [[h0p3]], and [[I aim|IA2DYJ]] to be a friend and an ally. I have looked through your history, and I can see it is my honor to meet you. Thank you for agreeing to speak with me. I admire your fervor and candor, nomad, and I can see that we have quite a bit in common (for example, I despise AMP with a passion, and you seem passionate about the topic too). I'm probably not as skilled with [[computers|Computing]] and prescription as you are, so go easy on me. Of course, I'm making it easier on myself by waiting too. Time has passed, and there are fewer people watching. The pressures are lower here now. Let us wrestle in dialectics openly and wisely together. We can also take our discussion off-site if you would be more comfortable.
>>> > What you don't realize...

>>> Hrm. Most people require more time and effort to figure out what I don't realize, including on this matter. I [[hope]] that we will one day know each [[other]] much better.

>>> Your thesis is that using AdNauseam (presumably any use) is stupid and (because it?) will get one's accounts banned with Google and Cloudflare. You have not defended this claim (or these claims, if you meant them as disconnected propositions).

>>> There are cases in which using AdNauseam is not stupid, and it is not inevitable that using it will get your accounts banned with these corporations. I'll agree (from practice) that its use can cause service problems for some people, but even that can be remedied (at least for now).

>>> > most of the users are dumb and set it to maximum click through rate, because they think it is some form of achievement. Going against the advertising mafia, fooling Google, etc.

>>> I don't see why I should think most current users behave in that fashion, but perhaps you have evidence you can show me (I've not looked). I'll agree that most prospective users are ignorant, though that doesn't mean they have to be: they have a choice. Surely you would agree: just because someone can use a tool in a stupid way doesn't mean any use of the tool is stupid. Encouraging people to understand and use their tools wisely seems reasonable. There is a path on which this tool can be used and developed wisely. Even if all it did was bring attention and experience to the problems in this sphere, it might be worth using in ways that we might otherwise deem "incorrect."

>>> Should we discuss the merits of monkey-wrenching digital advertisement industries? Are you claiming this tool doesn't present a problem for Google's business model? Let me grant that this is an arms race, one that our adversaries are winning, and one that they will likely win. There is something to be achieved here though, and this tool does achieve something, however small. I will also agree there are much bigger fish to fry than this in the political problem of the continued centralization [[power]].

>>> > To load the ads you need to click on, it has to contact the adserver. If it contacts the adserver, what's the point of an adblocker?

>>> There are number of reasons one might use an adblocker, right?

>>> Performance is one such reason. On my [[phone|monster-14]]'s 4G connection, my throughput is so slow that I can feel the difference between having ads and not. At home, I have a strong internet connection and a sufficiently fast [[computer|monster-16]] such that I often can't feel a sufficient difference. I use adblockers on both, but it sometimes serves an extra purpose on my phone.

>>> We can consider [[privacy]] to be another reason, and an extremely complex one, no doubt.

>>> I also consider the advertising industry to be immoral, but even if it weren't, I find ads (and an internet driven by ads) slow down my ability to find what is [[salient]]. Depending on what you mean, perhaps you and I will need to discuss the concept and practical concerns of "adfraud." Adblocking simplifies and improves the experience of acquiring knowledge and building relationships with [[others]] over digital mediums, and it enables us to take back some semblance of control of our [[political autonomy|Justice]].

>>> An adblocker that still contacted the adserver (which will perhaps ultimately have to be done to bypass restrictions in this arms race) but eliminated the display of the content in my browser is still incredibly useful to me in a large number of contexts. Of course, our attention spans are at stake. Let us consider the spectacle together wisely.

>>> > Also, faking stuff (here, you are faking your interests by clicking random ads) for privacy reasons is good in only very few situations. The best way to remain private is to not give any info at all, instead of faking it. Faking stuff should be the secondary choice.

>>> I'll agree that adding polluting noise, in some cases, may disrupt their ability to model us to some [[dok]]. Attacking ad companies effectively enough may also provide some disincentives for them to attempt to model our private lives (though I think that is limited). It may be worth it even if it only raised the cost of online advertising. Among many methods, [[ML|Aispondence]] may eventually make this untenable, and the overwhelming effectiveness of fingerprinting is exceptionally problematic. Thus, I will also agree that this not the most important user-rights tool, not by a long shot! It still costs them something though. There are privacy trade-offs to be had here, and this is a low-hanging fruit method. Even in steganography, where part of privacy (or even anonymity) may require masquerading as a normal-looking user, we'd want to have some imitation clicks. My suggestion is that AdNauseam is barely even an alpha concept. There is still an arms race to consider here.

>>> Continued use and development of AdNauseam doesn't have to be stupid.

>> Okay.
>> > The best way to use the tool is to have it click between rarely and sometimes

>> What you don't realize is most of the users are dumb and set it to maximum click through rate, because they think it is some form of achievement. Going against the advertising mafia, fooling Google, etc.

>> I think the one thing we cannot open for debate, because it is evident given any framework, is the impact of risk avoidance in knowledge acquisition.

And that's what I intended to say through describing risk. It is safe to begin with the framework and work within its constraints to achieve a relatively predictable result. However, that also averts any risk inherent to failures along processes that discover novel relationships, test outcomes, compare against known outcomes. That may yield more desirable results, but it's more often riddled with stochastic failure. It's natural to feel repulsion to it, but the ability to persist against continuous discomfort is what separates the Bezos, Musks, Gates, et. al. from nearly everyone else.

> It's very expensive to fittingly defend any conceptions of //real// and //knowledge// in my experience. It's hard to put into words, but I take representations (including what may seem as menial as mental models) made explicit to at least sometimes be necessary though insufficient (and not epiphenomenal) for being a good thinking thing like us. I am worried that some circles do not appreciate the anti-codificationist intuitions about virtue (of a practice) that you are speaking about. At the very least, some rails, footholds, rules-of-thumb, and oversimplified models can provide an accelerated ladder for us, and that may continue even for experts in at least some cases. Without denying the radical value of immersive experience in developing tacit knowledge (nor the necessity of fast emotion for slow cognition), I think there's plenty of room to debate about even the value of crutch-models, compressions, explicitly exploring, story-telling, and codifying instrumental reasoning for even the virtuoso (including with other virtuosos).

mental models are terrible. This entire farnam street /rationalist culture is terrible, fallacy screaming falls into the same category.
The reason why it's terrible is because mental models are like a sort of jumbled set of tools, copied over from somewhere else. Deep and genuine knowledge is tacit, integrated, incorporates experience and is organic. It's acquired through training and expertise and often can't be verbalised or formalised.

Relying on mental models is a sort of crutch. Maybe a good comparison is chess playing. If you're a new chess player you learn that pieces are worth X points, and that such and such squares are important, and that's basically like these sorts of models. Really good chess players don't consciously think like that, at least not in a sort of pronounced way. They've incorporated knowledge and play by intuition. They can make 'good moves' in a second or two.

I don't know why these 'fallacies' and 'mental model' things have taken off so much within certain circles, I feel like it's because people do nothing else other than reading these blogs. Real expertise or knowledge isn't gained by sitting around and 'thinking through stuff', it's by coming into interaction with the real world and immersing yourself in what you want to get better at.

>> This seems like the core question/hypothesis you have as to why you might suspect this particular technology. If you have other specific concerns or fears or misuse, please let me know, but I have not identified anything else I can speak directly to.

I ask for your patience in thinking outloud with me (and my schizoposting); I'm someone who isn't as skilled as you are with computers. Despite my ignorance, I am a person deeply concerned with p2p-ness. I'm delighted to see your argument, and I appreciate your perhaps contrarian perspective here.

>> Google is evil, and if we need to wrestle about that, I will. I'd like to see your red-team skepticism about their intentions and your attempt to consider how this may be a trojan horse or a false-compromise. Google is famous for making moves that look neutral or even good from many angles that are ultimately centralizing power in the hands of capitalists. With good reason, we should doubt why they are doing this. It does appear that the core intuition (if I understand correctly) in WebBundles //can// be used to improve decentralization of information power, but I suggest we should paranoically imagine how it may be exploitable by Google (that is our duty here).

>> I have some limited experience and a ton of skin in the game on this one. For several years, my wiki has had some of the properties of a prototype of a WebBundle, including an attempt at enabling cryptographic verification (https://philosopher.life/#Cryptographic%20Verification). My goal is to emit one huge all-inclusive html file with the signature wrapped around it (I sign and push/sync up to every minute). This enables me to distribute my wiki across many networks, even sneakernets, without losing one of the fundamental keys to my voice. I'm a second-class citizen on the internet compared to a large corporation, and I have to be able to effortlessly abandon or accept the losses of rented end-points (I really don't own my domain, access-point, or server...they are merely rented: I do own my private key though). In some sense, I have the opportunity to agnostically treat the methods of distribution as a lame middlemen pipeline (what we always hoped the internet infrastructure would really be). I give up my ability to control how my wiki is distributed in some sense as I enable anyone to pass around the signed wiki as a proxy. I happily lose the ability to check whether or not I want to send my signed wiki to any individual in many cases, and I lack interactive control of a session; it feels like I become a far more passive participant of the web, being incentivized to provide the read-only information valuable to ML and disincentived from relying upon dynamic real-time exchanges. I appreciate being able to prevent people from putting words in my mouth while also enabling users of my wiki to acquire and run the site offline, as they see fit, with maximum privacy and anonymity.

>> There's the context I have. From what I can tell, from a grassroots p2p practice, the reason that the signature "works" is because a user has maintained an old copy of the wiki or even just the public key that they do trust. They've chosen by hand to trust it's me that signed it. I'm not convinced that Google intends to maximize the automation and decentralization value of that kind of verification. It seems an incidental possibility at best (perhaps there's their quasi plausible deniability in seeking a monopoly).

>> They aim to be more than merely a very large peer, and I'm begging you to question that more openly with me. This feels like a disruptive feint only seeking decentrality in name. Perhaps their move weakens the powers of many web infrastructures that would otherwise continue to centralize, but I think they will continue to attempt to take over whatever power vacuums arise in that space (I assume they can see how to make money off this far better than I can too). When I see, for example, Dat become a first-class citizen of Chrome and when I see them empower client-side archiving, search, and moderation to users of their infrastructure (while taking Firefox and web standards off the leash), I'll begin to believe they intend to enable a p2p web. For now, I see them building an AMPed blackhole walled-garden where they aim to be the root server of trust and authority on what is salient while allowing the highest paying bidders to have degrees of access or control over our data, minds, and lives.


Part of what excites me is that it decentralizes where assets have to come from. Yes it means Google can serve stuff, which will help some all operators at who knows exactly what cost of privacy.
But what absolutely electrifies me is that I can share content with other people: even in an offline scenario I can give then a webbundle with a site if the site supports it, and the friend's browser can crytographically check everything out, & trust that the bundle is from the bundler.

> Right now, requests on the web are kind of p2p.

Today's web is decentralized, because there are many domains. But there is little peering among peers: everything is client-server.

This, imo, enables a much more p2p web. It enables a distributed web. Where even if an endpoint is under attack, the web can go on. Where folks who fall over the edge (go offline) can still operate. But yes, seems likely Google intends to be a rather large peer among this newly distributed web.

I recommend the IETF draft of use cases for getting a taste of what WebBundles is for, which hints at this new distributed architecture, by way of describing characteristics a WebBundled web has,

Do you think this is an arms race that is won by hand?

>I'm not saying I disagree with you. I want to know more about what you think.

I'm, like, not familiar at all with stylometry on a working basis, so this is absolutely just, like, my opinion, man. But the few examples I've seen of it were far more likely to bunch up subject choice than style e.g. all ethics to one heap, all metaphysics to another, regardless of author. And if you control for something like that (pet subject?) I don't know how much information would remain in the purely structural information of the text i.e. comma placement choice, but I'd guess it's fairly low. There are only so many ways to say things, and even then there are people seem to go straight to the point.

> You're welcome. One optimistic-ish sci-fi book I've re-read several times when I need a lift is "Voyage from Yesteryear" by James P. Hogan from around 1982: http://www.jamesp... "The fun begins when a generation ship housing a population of thousands arrives to "reclaim" the colony on behalf of the repressive, authoritarian regime that emerged following the crisis period. The Mayflower II brings with it all the tried and tested apparatus for bringing a recalcitrant population to heel: authority, with its power structure and symbolism, to impress; commercial institutions with the promise of wealth and possessions, to tempt and ensnare; a religious presence, to awe and instill duty and obedience; and if all else fails, armed military force to compel. But what happens when these methods encounter a population that has never been conditioned to respond? The book has an interesting corollary. Around about the mid eighties, I received a letter notifying me that the story had been serialized in an underground Polish s.f. magazine. They hadn't exactly "stolen" it, the publishers explained, but had credited zlotys to an account in my name there, so if I ever decided to take a holiday in Poland the expenses would be covered (there was no exchange mechanism with Western currencies at that time). Then the story started surfacing in other countries of Eastern Europe, by all accounts to an enthusiastic reception. What they liked there, apparently, was the updated "Ghandiesque" formula on how bring down an oppressive regime when it's got all the guns. And a couple of years later, they were all doing it!"
> As your point implies, authority is given by the people. The same point is made in the US Declaration of Independence about "consent of the governed": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consent_of_the_governed

> As is shown (fictionally) in Voyage from Yesteryear, if many people stop obeying like with a general strike (at least until full automation) or just by walking away to new opportunities in a different part of the system, then authority comes under pressure to respond (hopefully positively) or it will eventually will collapse. A similar point is made in the chapter on the "Ghands" in the 1962 sci-fi novel the The Great Explosion" by Eric Frank Russell who live by the adage "Freedom can say "I won't"".

> The same has been true throughout human history as explained in Daniel Quinn's "Beyond Civilization: Humanity's Next Great Adventure" where he shows how centralized governance has collapsed many times in human history as whatever problems emerged in it (often from external pressures like droughts or plagues leading to systemic stress) caused most people to just walk away back to the wilderness to live off the land. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_Civilization

> For good or bad, walking away is not much of an option these days given large populations, global surveillance, and also WMDs like nukes and plagues and so on that could be unleashed accidentally or on purpose if power centers collapse.

> Collapse of power centers in modern times is also often problematical regarding what comes next -- when most people can't walk away -- is usually the next-best organized group taking over. For example, students in Iran could eventually overthrow the US-installed Sha -- but then better-organized religious hardliners took over in the resulting power vacuum (which is probably not what most Iranian students had in mind for their future). Or, as other examples, the USA could relatively easily overthrow Saddam Hussein in Iraq or Muammar Gaddafi in Libya -- but the resulting power vacuums have created politician and humanitarian disasters which have been very costly to the USA (especially in Iraq, costing trillions of dollars to US taxpayers -- although as a bunch of defense companies have made billions that may have been part of why it went forward despite many people pointing out what was likely to happen: https://www.wanttoknow.info/warisaracket ).

> Related humor: "Monty Python: What have the Romans ever done for us?" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djZkTnJnLR0

> Of course, power centers also tend to actively disrupt any possible other power centers. See the "Old Guy" Cybertank novels for some graphic sci-fi accounts of that in one.

> Or for the real world, see for example Noam Chomsky's "The Threat of a Good Example": http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Chomsky/ChomOdon_Example.h... "No country is exempt from U.S. intervention, no matter how unimportant. In fact, it's the weakest, poorest countries that often arouse the greatest hysteria. ... As far as American business is concerned, Nicaragua could disappear and nobody would notice. The same is true of El Salvador. But both have been subjected to murderous assaults by the US, at a cost of hundreds of thousands of lives and many billions of dollars. There's a reason for that. The weaker and poorer a country is, the more dangerous it is as an example. If a tiny, poor country like Grenada can succeed in bringing about a better life for its people, some other place that has more resources will ask, "why not us?" "

> As you say, people in power have little reason to embrace change -- since their power derives from the status quo. Related on "Orthodoxy" by G. K. Chesteron: https://www.ccel.org/ccel/chesterton/orthodoxy.x.html "We have remarked that one reason offered for being a progressive is that things naturally tend to grow better. But the only real reason for being a progressive is that things naturally tend to grow worse. The corruption in things is not only the best argument for being progressive; it is also the only argument against being conservative. The conservative theory would really be quite sweeping and unanswerable if it were not for this one fact. But all conservatism is based upon the idea that if you leave things alone you leave them as they are. But you do not. If you leave a thing alone you leave it to a torrent of change. If you leave a white post alone it will soon be a black post. If you particularly want it to be white you must be always painting it again; that is, you must be always having a revolution. Briefly, if you want the old white post you must have a new white post. But this which is true even of inanimate things is in a quite special and terrible sense true of all human things. An almost unnatural vigilance is really required of the citizen because of the horrible rapidity with which human institutions grow old. It is the custom in passing romance and journalism to talk of men suffering under old tyrannies. But, as a fact, men have almost always suffered under new tyrannies; under tyrannies that had been public liberties hardly twenty years before. ..."

> Classically, people have "organized" via a certain sort of social process, such as documented in "Politics the Wellstone Way: How to Elect Progressive Candidates and Win on Issues": https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/234876.Politics_the_Well...

> One can wonder how effective such classical organizing is anymore given tightly controlled (by money) major broadcast media. And even if that was somehow circumvented, then as with Bernie Sanders (twice), the establishment has other ways of preserving itself like by convincing candidates to drop out of the race.

> Then there are other possible ways of disrupting such organizations vulnerable to things like, say, small plane crashes involving key organizers. Wellstone died in a small plane crash, which of course might have just been an accident despite suggestions to the contrary: https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2002/10/well-o29.html "Wellstone‚Äôs death comes almost two years to the day after a similar plane crash killed another Democratic Senate hopeful locked in a tight election contest, Missouri Governor Mel Carnahan, on October 16, 2000. The American media duly noted the ‚Äúeerie coincidence,‚Äù as though it was a statistical oddity, rather than suggesting a pattern. One might say, paraphrasing Oscar Wilde, that to lose one senator is a misfortune, but to lose two senators, the same way, is positively suspicious."

> Another idea other than "organizing" that fits with what you wrote on spontaneous mass cooperation is "quorum sensing": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quorum_sensing "In biology, quorum sensing is the ability to detect and to respond to cell population density by gene regulation. As one example, quorum sensing (QS) enables bacteria to restrict the expression of specific genes to the high cell densities at which the resulting phenotypes will be most beneficial. Many species of bacteria use quorum sensing to coordinate gene expression according to the density of their local population. In a similar fashion, some social insects use quorum sensing to determine where to nest. Also, quorum sensing might be useful for cancer cell communications too. In addition to its function in biological systems, quorum sensing has several useful applications for computing and robotics. In general, quorum sensing can function as a decision-making process in any decentralized system in which the components have: (a) a means of assessing the number of other components they interact with and (b) a standard response once a threshold number of components is detected."

> Ultimately, if systems of power refuse to negotiate new terms for support by the governed when circumstances change, either they will be successful at suppressing dissent by whatever means or they won't. But if centers of power are going to fail, the longer they fight change, often the worse the failure, and the less the existing power may have a say in the new order (for good or bad).

> Still, in the past, some power centers (typically organized around control of a key resource like water) have lasted for thousands of years (such as the Egyptian Empire) -- so people in power can always hope they will be part of the next Ancient Egypt. As G. William Domhoff writes regarding "four main organizational networks -- ideological, economic, military, and political -- as the building blocks for power structures": https://whorulesamerica.ucsc.edu/theory/four_networks.html "Before civilizations emerged, there may have been "inverted power structures" in which the rank-and-file could discipline would-be dominators through gossip, scorn, shunning, and if need be, assassination (Boehm, 1999). Only where river flooding allowed the possibility of alluvial agriculture, in conjunction with close proximity to geographical areas that encouraged different but complementary networks, did the "caging" of populations make possible the development of the fixed power structures of domination and exploitation that have characterized all civilizations. The strong egalitarian tendencies that characterized pre-historic social groups were submerged when power seekers could build on a religious, economic, military, or political base to gain control of others."

> I've been hopeful for a Universal Basic Income eventually to soften the worst extremes of the USA's current economic system for many people (as part of a healthy mix of subsistence, gift, exchange, and planned activities in society). But given that the obvious solution was not tried on an even temporary basis for the pandemic despite multiple congress people endorsing monthly payments for the duration, it seems like the USA is still not quite there yet -- even if closer than ever, given increased public awareness of the idea. For example Kamala Harris: https://twitter.com/KamalaHarris/status/1271151635549556736 "Roughly 44M Americans have filed for unemployment over the past 12 weeks. That‚Äôs why @BernieSanders, @EdMarkey & I introduced a bill to give $2,000 monthly payments to people throughout this crisis. Bills didn‚Äôt stop just because we‚Äôre in the middle of a pandemic."

> Rashida Tlaib, AOC, and other Congressional representatives have similar ideas. Instead of those ideas, the USA quickly threw trillions of dollars at wealthy people: https://prospect.org/coronavirus/unsanitized-bailouts-tradit...

> G. William Domhoff has some other interesting thing to on his website, stuff sometimes many years old, like: https://whorulesamerica.ucsc.edu/change/science_why.html "Based on these findings, it seems likely that everyday people don't opt for social change in good part because they don't see any plausible way to accomplish their goals, and haven't heard any plans from anyone else that make sense to them. But why don't they just say "the hell with it" and head to the barricades? Why aren't they "fed up?" The answer is not in their false consciousness or a mere resigned acquiescence, as many leftists seem to believe, but in a very different set of factors. On the one hand, for all the injustices average Americans experience and perceive, there are many positive aspects to everyday life that make a regular day-to-day existence more attractive than a general strike or a commitment to building a revolutionary party. They have loved ones they like to be with, they have hobbies and sports they enjoy, and they have forms of entertainment they like to watch. In fact, many of them also report in surveys that they enjoy their jobs even though the jobs don't pay enough or have decent benefits. (And as of late 2005, 93% of individuals earning over $50,000 a year describe themselves as "doing well.") They also understand that they have some hard-won democratic rights and freedoms inherited from the past that are much more than people in many other countries have. They don't want to see those positive aspects messed up. On a less positive note, many ordinary white workers have priorities that they put ahead of economic issues. As all voting and field studies show, a large number of average white Americans do many things based on their skin color. They often vote Republican, for example, especially in the South. They protest against affirmative action programs. They live in segregated neighborhoods. White Americans also often vote their religion -- that is, the fundamentalist Protestants and conservative Catholics who vote Republican are members of non-college-educated blue-collar and white-collar families. In terms of their economic situation, and their need for unions, they should be for the Democrats, but many of them aren't. It is these alternative issues, both positive and negative, rooted in their own lives and experiences, not a false consciousness created by the capitalists' ideological hegemony, that explain why most Americans don't rebel -- or even vote their pocketbook -- most of the time. In short, the theorists of consciousness may be serious thinkers, and they work at a level that is very attractive to most leftists, but they are wrong when it comes to understanding why positive social change does not happen. They have misconstrued the problem, which has to do with structures of power and life circumstances and the compelling nature of everyday life, not the chains of consciousness. They have misunderstood everyday people, and in effect blamed them for the failures of the left, even though at the theoretical level it seems like they are blaming the overwhelming powers of the dominant class or power elite. They have made the people the problem instead of considering the possibility that what the left offers does not make any sense to most people."

> Outrage and destruction resulting from unhappiness and stress is one thing; coherent collective action to some positive ends is another. Destruction is relatively easy compared to making things better. It's OK to be angry or sad as recent protesters in the USA must be feeling, but as Mr. Fred Rogers sings, "What do you do with the Mad that you feel?" And as Domhoff suggests, that can be a difficult question about how to change things to make them better for more people without making things worse for lots more other people.

It was my honor to read your argument. Thank you. Please feel free to not respond.

I suggest the only justified criterion of authority and rule of law emerges from a high-performance liquid democracy built on infrastructures owned by the people. Those in power have little egoistic reason to enable that thing to evolve. Spontaneous mass cooperation that radically leverages webs of epistemic trust toward maximizing the utility of the those at the bottom appears to be our only hope; I do not predict it.

> Sure, what do you want to know?
> I currently work on synbio √ó web archival.

> Some of us are cooking up futuretech aimed at storing all of IA (archive.org) in a shoebox. Others are working on putting archival tools in more normal web users' hands, and making those tools do things that people tend to value more in the short-term, like help them understand what they're researching, rather than merely stash pages.

> My ambitions for web archives are outsized compared to other archivists, but I'm fine with that. I'm looking beyond web archives as we currently understand them toward web archives as something else that doesn't quite exist yet: everyday artefacts, colocated and integrated with other web technology to an extent that they serve in essential sensemaking, workflow, and maybe security roles.

> Right now, some obvious, pressing priorities are (a) preserving vastly more content and (b) doing more with the archives themselves.

> A: The overwhelming majority of born-digital content is lost within a far narrower time-slice than would admit preservation at current rates, and data growth is accelerating beyond the reach of conventional storage media. So, for me, the world's current largest x is never the true object of my desire. I'm after a way to hold the world that is and the world to come.

> Ideally, that world to come is one where lifelong data stewardship of everything from your own genome to your digital footprint is ubiquitously available and loss of information has been largely rendered optional.

> This, of course, requires magic storage density that simply defies fundamental limitations of conventional storage media. I'm strongly confident that we're getting early glimpses of the first real Magic contenders. All lie outside, or on the far periphery of, the evolutionary tree that got us the storage media we have today. For instance, I'm running an art exhibition that involves encoding all the works on DNA.

> B: Distributed archival that comes almost as naturally as browsing is well within reach, and with that comes some very new potential for distributed computation on archives. One hand washes the other.

> One important thing to realize here is that, in many cases, you can name a very small handful of individuals as the reason why current archival resources exist. GPT-3 is cracking the surface by training on data produced by one guy named Sebastian, for instance.

> ‚Ä¶i'm sorta tired and have to respond to something about every twitter snapshot since June being broken, though, so I'll pick this back up later.

No pressure: feel free to ignore me, please. Would you mind elaborating? I'm interested in what you have to say (and, of course, feel free to say it privately if you prefer). I would like to even hear your dreams, wild speculations, or gut feelings about the matter.

> I think it's fair to call it a personal site and a public self-model, though I cannot say it merits popularity. Unfortunately, I don't have a short and clean answer for what it is about (though I spend significant energy trying to answer that question). It's a place to think, a conduit to communicate with myself and others, and it's where I do philosophy. Each member of my immediate family writes in a wiki every day. We autonomously tell the stories of our lives with these devices. Some kinds of relationships and conversations require 10,000 hours, and we aim to make art of our lives together. It is my honor to speak with others through my wiki.

What is your site about? I've seen it four times this week, but I haven't really figured out why it's popular.

>>Blog is perhaps too weak a term; it is far more than that. I'm sorry that it's not intuitive or polished. It really isn't everyone's cup of tea. In a way, it is difficult to navigate because it's huge (much larger than most people would predict). There are currently +12,000 different pages inside the html file. Even the questions of what I think is Good, what is good in the wiki, and what it is good for, are core problems I wrestle with quite a bit inside it. I suggest that if it were to be useful to you, it would be in virtue of your patience and curiosity. I'm not trying to be obscure here, and it's not a mere game. I just don't know how to say it any better. I recommend wandering the entrance.

> I couldn't really navigate your blog easily. Any posts you'd like to point me to that you think are good?

<br>

>> Aww, thank you. I spend a lot of time inside it, so I'm glad to have something I enjoy looking at. I hope to be meticulous.

>Fantastic blog. The way you have used characters to display pictures, timelines. Lots of hard work and very meticulous.

<br>

>>That is an excellent concern. I've not generated my initial analysis of the concept of rhetoric yet, but it is a common topic in the wiki (it's a word I have wielded hundreds of times in it so far). I have a lot to say about it, but I don't want to flood you. So, I'll hedged-conservatively ack in our dialectic here. I suggest that whatever is normatively valuable about rhetoric can be analyzed in terms of rightness or beauty. When rhetoric is used wisely, it is a justified beautiful hack in expression.

> `>`The Right and The Beautiful are sublated by The Good.

> That's an interesting postulated relationship between three of the four normative sciences. You've covered logic, aesthetic, and ethic. How does rhetoric relate?

<br>

>> That's very kind of you. Thank you. I appreciate when people reach out to let me know. I've been trying to do the same for others lately. Feel free to HMU too; it's always my honor to speak with people over my wiki.

> Your wiki is stupid cool. Love the layout and look and content. Just thought I'd let you know.

<br>

>>Thank you, that is very high praise. I've worked hard on it, and I'm glad it's useful. If you ever get the chance, I would like to see what you build. I think wikis are a great opportunity to share ourselves represented in hypertext with others. You should check out https://sphygm.us/.

>>I suppose this is neither here nor there, but for the giggles, I've been trying to reach out to the cast of Stranger Things (they aren't easy to reach) to see if they would make wikis too; I'd like to get to know them (or their characters) through their own self-modeling.

> Your wiki is absolutely brilliant. This is something I've been really wanting to get into and you've given me a lot of inspiration and ideas.

I don't know if my situation fits yours. I'm a crazy person.

My wiki (https://philosopher.life) started out as a non-linear letter. That seed grew into a vine and then a garden. I write every day, even when I don't want to. I talk to myself and those who matter to me (even those I've not yet met or never will). I write because the stories we tell and retell ourselves and others are objectively valuable. I consider it my moral obligation and vocation to read, think, and write.

>Hello h0p3, I modeled much of my tiddlywiki (not public, used for life stuff more than a public repo of thoughts) after yours, and greatly enjoy your writing. Just figured you ought to hear that!

Hi zalberico, I'm h0p3. I can't say I get it either. My wiki is a place to store stuff and to tell myself linked stories. Maybe it is a hypertext castle, a rabbithole, a garden, a mind map, an exobrain, a Zettelkasten, an existential mirror or conduit. Despite significant effort, I'm not sure how to describe it well enough. It's a site I like to see. It's where I do muh thinkin, I tellyawhat.

Also, Fraidyc.at works with Tiddlywikis.
