title: 2021.08.30 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Handing You The Reins To My Emotional State In T-Minus 3...2...1...

<<<
[[TTTOTW]]. [[IncandescentEel]] and my other [[FTO]] writings consuming my compute. Watermelon + Sourdough w/cream cheese. Fireman Time! Laundry. Footbath + some LolVod (my brain hurts).

I slept like absolute garbage. I'm assuming I slept. I cannot say I am confident in it, but surely it happened. It's been a while since I slept that poorly. Headache. Just a blur.

//Skintime//.

[[Family Time]] was excellent. My work was expensive to read in many respects. A serious discussion with my daughter, and she was sufficiently rational in appearance (hands me the signs) to be handed what she wanted. My daughter is hereby released of her political obligations to read this ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱. It's up to her now. Her argument was cogent enough, and she understood my argument well enough that I think it's time. With it, I've shown her what I'm morally obligated to show her about the human condition and her own context. It's your autonomy, madame. Wield it wisely. We had other disagreements as well, including thinking about her traveling across the country in a car with her friends - we are waiting on her schoolwork to actually be completed correctly and consistently; I'd adore to see it happen asap though.

Wife and I had a salad and quick pickles. 

//The Walk// with mi amor, but it was cut short. Something is wrong with her foot. //Raw Skintime//. She felt overwhelmed then, maybe even a tad grouchy, understandably. She's cycling through what she has to accomplish before tomorrow morning (and the rest of the week). She's a bit nervous about not being allowed to join, since there may not be enough space for her (most of the professors I know will bend over backward though, especially if you are kicking ass). 

Fireman Time! 

We began watching //Star Trek: The Motion Picture// (this is maybe the third time my offspring have been in the room to watch it, and this is the time it has clicked). My wife has the deathtouch for my wireless keyboards (it's cute). She [[paused]] many, many times to provide background valuable to the story (as we simply don't have time to watch all the shows). We got halfway through, but it was too late. Bed for everyone at 10.

Woke at 2:30ish. Brain-hurty, but I'm alert (probably because hurtiness). [[TTTOTW]]. Footbath + Watermelon + Dark Chocolate + Chips. Talked with [[anon]]. 

She's up. Scuttled to her. She's dandy today, and she's wearing that black and white cheongsam that makes her look exceptionally fertile with her b/w checkered shoes in cute socks, but no hairsticks. Wednesday is the new schedule, and she's got lots of scheduling to do. Packed her bag for the emergency lunch supplies. Told me about her grandfather's TB miracle and conversion experience while escaping the MIC; that's a piece I was a missing. Hugs'n'bugs. Offspring are testing today.

[[TTTOTW]] + Water + Sourdough w/CC. [[Anon]] made me laugh. I opened their third eye and anus (feel like those are the same object for me). Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Hardcore grinding until I just couldn't stay awake. Was trying to make it, but I couldn't. Sleep by 12:30.

Woke at 3:45. It was enough. Meditation. Fireman Time! 

//The Walk// with my offspring. They didn't do as they were supposed to outside (on Saturday or this morning). Continued to think about the implications of that. It was a good walk. My son hasn't practiced math in god knows how long, but his test was excellent for his grade level; he didn't do any work though. My daughter worked for one of her books (creative and critical writing suits her), and she stood up to plenty of probing questions. Vapelyfe. Met Carlos with The Sunflowers, a vette, my daughter had a lot to say about him after the conversation. 

Raspberry kisses. Way into it. A shower. She told me about her day. Her chest hasn't been feeling right. The security problem is 80% hers, finding it quite difficult to get an answer from anyone. Working within the library proper tends to be smooth, but outside is a clusterfuck of people who don't experience vocational [[awe]]. Her desire to have so much prep time before she leaves and before she sleeps cuts deep. I hope that in time, it will be stable and optimized. I think there's an hour to recover between the two.

My wife and I made dinner while the offspring performed their duties. 

[[Family Gathering]] to finish off the first Trek movie. Somewhere between chili rellenos and stuffed peppers, with honeydew melon and water. Gobbled. Lots of talking, trying to give context to what this body of work represented at the time of its creation. //Skintime//. My daughter has been trained to be the worst kind of movie-goer, constantly talking at the screen (good for you, kid :P). //Raw Skintime//. 

A flash. <3.

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time!
