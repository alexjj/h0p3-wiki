"""
How's your week been?
Jun 19 1:58pm
Mediocre. And I'll take that. How about you?
Jun 19 5:04pm
Mediocre sounds like a reasonable threshold. `/salute`
Jun 19 11:22pm
I'm doing well enough. Had a lot of serious conversations.
Jun 19 11:22pm
What kind of serious conversations did you have, and with who? Not digging. Just curious.
Jun 20 3:20pm
I've not posted all of them yet (usually takes me about a month to get to it).
Jun 20 3:21pm
My brother, [[JRE]], concerning politics and parenting (a technical discussion). He will be seeing our donors on Sunday. I think he was looking to come with cognitive ammo, in case it would be necessary.
Jun 20 3:21pm
I armed him.
Jun 20 3:21pm
I cried to see my friend [[Sphygmus]] again. Been thinking with her a lot.
Jun 20 3:22pm
Some developers of TW have responded to my post to the [[TWGGF]], and it requires far more thought from me to give an answer.
Jun 20 3:22pm
A very intelligent ex-student of my wife's and now family friend who is in trouble (husband beat her, she's escaping), [[MWGhandi]], has been speaking with me about how to become a data scientist for the sake of public policy (seems like she's going for two masters).
Jun 20 3:24pm
My daughter wrote me a letter that was extremely heavy, articulate, and required us to speak into the next morning.
Jun 20 3:25pm
Been attempting to justify the urban camping project to my wife on her walks and navigate a complex political system in Yale (I consider people far more evil than she does, so I have to see who they really are).
Jun 20 3:26pm
I suppose it's been one-sided, but my friend [[kickscondor]] has been thinking a lot out loud, including about [[@: hypertext 2020]]. I'm digesting his words.
Jun 20 3:27pm
Wow. You have been having alot of heavy conversations this week.
Jun 20 3:27pm
Aye. https://philosopher.life/#2020.05.18%20-%20BL%3A%20Catching%20Up -- been helping him try to open it (he says he's afraid).
Jun 20 3:28pm
My homeless friend, Benjamin, is growing closer with us. We finally have a deaddrop for him. I am not skilled at interpreting him, but I'm doing what I can.
Jun 20 3:29pm
That is very kind of you. I stay isolated. Not alot of homeless here. And most of the beggers walk to their cars and drive off when done. Doesn't mean they are not on hard times. But I suspect its more drug related.
Jun 20 3:34pm
You have been super busy this week it seems. I not so much. We did have a successful fishing trip last night.
Jun 20 3:40pm
Ah, you work hard too. My conversations are my job.
Jun 20 3:47pm
What did you catch?

24" striped bass and a flat head cat.
Jun 20 4:20pm
You get to eat it?
Jun 20 4:20pm
Cleaned it at 3 am this morning. Going to cook today.

That's amazing.
Jun 20 9:07pm
I hope you have a meal that lasts a lifetime with your family, sir.
Jun 20 9:07pm
Very impressed with the baked fish. We backed one fillet of the striper bass, and some of the catfish. Came out great. No fishy taste.
Jun 20 9:07pm
Thanks. Making memories best a man can for the kiddo and my fam.
