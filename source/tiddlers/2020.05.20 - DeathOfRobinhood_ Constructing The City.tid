Hey, how are you doing friend?
May 20 8:17pm
I accidentally deleted signal, hope I didn't miss much!
May 20 8:17pm
Hey! =)
May 20 8:18pm
Working hard, thinking a bunch, lost as usual. =)
May 20 8:19pm
Heading to our family gathering. I will be back later tonight.
May 20 8:19pm
How has life been going for you?
May 20 9:18pm
Fine. Selah and I have been thinking how to restructure our lives to make them more aligned with what we interpret to be God's ideals
May 20 10:13pm
Hope your family gathering was fruitful
May 20 10:13pm
It was. Mostly talked about [[k0sh3k]]'s work.
May 20 10:14pm
Restructuring can be very expensive.
May 20 10:15pm
It's scary
May 20 10:15pm
Yeah.
May 20 10:15pm
I mean, getting married was a not insignificant restructuring
May 20 10:15pm
But there are areas I am intentionally blind to
May 20 10:16pm
Questions I'm afraid to ask
May 20 10:16pm
It's nice to have someone to ask them with
May 20 10:16pm
Selah's thinking of volunteering at long term care facilities to help with the crisis stuff. We're also looking how we can make ourselves more available for the struggling people in our neighbourhood.
May 20 10:21pm
When I was younger and more foolhardy, I'd throw myself at this sort of stuff, and found it exhilarating. Now I feel just old and selfish.
May 20 10:22pm
You are free to ask me, of course, and off the record whenever you wish (you're my Root User). I ask that you pick out my blind spots whenever you feel it important. I don't feel like you intend to be blind. I think you face things few men I know have the integrity to face.
May 20 10:22pm
We have limited resources, and it is difficult to be a good steward of how we spend them, even in altruism.
May 20 10:23pm
I think you know what you are spending and why.
May 20 10:24pm
I admire that you know that doing the right thing because it's the right the to do is motivation that gives an act merit. I think you are shedding the hedonic properties of giving to some degree. It may also be more cognitive for you now that your frontal lobes are more fully developed.
May 20 10:26pm
Do my motives matter to anyone but me?
May 20 10:27pm
They objectively matter, even when no one knows, especially when your left hand doesn't know your right hand is doing.
May 20 10:29pm
Knowing the right thing is hard. Doing the right thing is next to impossible. Now you ask that my motives be pure too?
May 20 10:30pm
I am a fan of the sad philanthropist. Even if some of his emotional traits and dispositions are not in perfect alignment with what is reasonable (I suggest these also tend to change over time and habituation), doing the right thing because it's reasonable even if he doesn't like every aspect of it is still the crux of love. The shopkeeper who only tells the truth because it benefits him to be known as an honest shopkeeper lacks a justification that has the merit of the goodwill of the sad philanthropist.
May 20 10:34pm
I love that you believe reason is congruent with love
May 20 10:36pm
!! =)\
May 20 10:36pm
I'm not quite in a tizzy right now, despite my drama. We've just been discussing practical steps to do what we've been wanting to for awhile
May 20 10:37pm
It's probably all the cognitive dissonance I need to maintain that weakens my perception of reason's sturdiness. My faith is really a brutish thing.
May 20 10:41pm
Mine too. I'm a caveman.
May 20 10:42pm
How I wish you would stop building skyscrapers in the desert and come live in a tent of skins with me
May 20 10:42pm
Dude. I would fucking love to live with you.
May 20 10:42pm
One of my concerns with my wiki (and a piece of technology I aim to dream up for humanity) is that it may be a tower of babel.
May 20 10:45pm
O
May 20 10:45pm
I'm a grandiose fool too often.
May 20 10:45pm
Look, you're clearly some kind of crazy person
May 20 10:47pm
lol, preach, yo.
May 20 10:47pm
And it's too much to ask that you stop being that
May 20 10:47pm
Unless it is reasonable, and you have to help me understand what is reasonable with and regarding me. Aint right for me to do that task alone.
May 20 10:48pm
What do you think I should do?
May 20 10:48pm
Repent and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
May 20 10:50pm
What else could I have said
May 20 10:50pm
True. I don't know what to predict from you other than that.
May 20 10:52pm
I am reaching out to another Christian man I know from long ago.
May 20 10:53pm
BL
May 20 10:53pm
He is an academic Kantian. Perhaps he will resolve the problem.
May 20 10:54pm
We have a lot in common. Evangelical upbringing, same school, roommates, his focus on Biblical Studies and Theology, mine on Philosophy. He ended up becoming a philosopher, yet he still believes. He aint afraid to wrestle either. I aim to understand his perspective carefully.
May 20 10:56pm
When two people are clothed and fed, that's just about the most loving thing one can do for another
May 20 10:58pm
I admire the sentiment.
May 20 10:58pm
But you disagree?
May 20 10:58pm
I agree with the spirit of the claim. I am an awful parser, and here is my caveat: I take the "Bread Alone" claim very seriously. It is not a material goal that I am after, though all matter ought to serve it. I agree that the spirit of second greatest law will be demonstrated in no small part by clothing and feeding people. It is necessary, but insufficient in itself.
May 20 11:01pm
the "just about" is why I do not disagree.
May 20 11:01pm
Oh, just to clarify, what I meant was, if the person you're interfacing with isn't starving or naked, the best way to demonstrate love towards them is by "aiming to understand their perspective carefully."
May 20 11:03pm
But that empathy is worth beans if you witthold your hand etc
May 20 11:03pm
Ah, yes. That makes sense. I agree.
May 20 11:04pm
Clumsily phrased
May 20 11:04pm
So I got this game on Steam
May 20 11:04pm
Disco Elysium
May 20 11:04pm
You heard of it?
May 20 11:04pm
Nope. Googling.
May 20 11:05pm
I feel like you consulted for it
May 20 11:05pm
It's mostly a game of interacting with people. You bring to the table 24 skills, parts of your psyche, that you interface with as separate characters, making conversations deeply meta, strategic affairs
May 20 11:07pm
It's also super communist
May 20 11:07pm
If you're into that sort of thing
May 20 11:07pm
My deeply alcoholic detective character is a kind of dumb empath with decent reflexes and no muscle
May 20 11:08pm
Damn commies, lol. It looks like a fascinating game, but one so extremely hard I would not be able to play it.
May 20 11:09pm
Do they do a good job of building mechanics that allow you to build your character in such a way that they really affect gameplay and strategy?
May 20 11:10pm
If you put enough points into empathy, it will empathize for you :)
May 20 11:10pm
Combat seems totally different in a detective game.
May 20 11:10pm
Done. I gotsta get me one o them.
May 20 11:11pm
Oh man, limbic system and reptilian brain.
May 20 11:12pm
It's really all sorts of brilliant
May 20 11:13pm
Oh wow. The narrative (tree?) possibilities seem over-the-top dense.
May 20 11:16pm
It had me rolling with conversation branch responses like "fuck it. I'll live in a dumpster. Hobocop."
May 20 11:17pm
lol.
May 20 11:18pm
I've been looking for a game to play (I'm the sort who gets sucked in completely, ofc).
May 20 11:19pm
Seems like it would have non-trivial replayability too.
May 20 11:20pm
I've only been playing on weekends (computer setup here is complicated) but I'd love to do this along with you
May 20 11:20pm
Neat. Alright, let me see what I can do on my end here to have a machine running.
May 20 11:20pm
Might be a family event too. I think everyone would find this fascinating.
May 20 11:21pm
It looks like a visual novel done correctly.
May 20 11:22pm
That seems a right way of categorizing it
May 20 11:23pm
Anyway, we're gonna drift off.
May 20 11:24pm
Thanks for chatting. Sorry if I was unjustifiably rude a bit
May 20 11:24pm
Sleep well, sir. I'm glad we were able to talk. I'm going to keep thinking. Thanks for the game recommendation too.
May 20 11:25pm
Naw, you weren't rude at all.
May 20 11:25pm
I might have been rude a few times and then erased without sending. I forget.
May 20 11:25pm
(and, you have a right to be rude at will with me; you'll have to do it sometimes cause I'm a stubborn sumbitch)
May 20 11:25pm
ðŸ¤ 
May 20 11:26pm
I love you. Will voice chat whenever you are down for it too. Get some sleep.
May 20 11:26pm
