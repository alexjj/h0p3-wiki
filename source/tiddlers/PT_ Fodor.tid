* Every event that falls under a special science predicate also falls under a physical predicate, but not vice versa.
* The special sciences are 'autonomous' with their irreducible generalizations about irreducible and usually efficacious higher-level properties
* Brain states are like computer states, capable of representation in virtue of causal connections with the world.
* Thought draws upon brain states which function as sentence-like representations - a 'language of thought'
* The mind contains a number of highly specialized, modular systems, whose operations are largely independent from each other. 
* The brain's central systems of belief fixation, planning, etc, are not modular; they are domain general, unencapsulated.
* The complexity of our minds is irrelevant the question of whether they're the products of natural selection.
* The theory of natural selection cannot predict/explain what traits are selected-for and what traits are free-riders
