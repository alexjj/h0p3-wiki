[9:11 PM] h0p3: yo :slight_smile:
[9:12 PM] Magnus: o/

[3:53 PM] h0p3: So how'd you get into magic?
[6:30 PM] Magnus: Ah hey there! I started playing back in High school with my friend group. Took a break during college but started up again in 2018
[7:50 PM] h0p3: Cool. I tried it couple times before I got into it. I've not played significantly in a while though. It's something I get to do with my offspring here and there. Gorgeous game.
[7:51 PM] h0p3: What formats do you enjoy, and what tools and boards are worth using these days?
[11:14 PM] Magnus: I WAS playing lots of Standard at FNM, but thanks to Corona that's been put on hold
[11:15 PM] Magnus: Lately I'm playing a bunch of Modern and Legacy on MTGO
[11:15 PM] Magnus: Emeria Titan is my favorite pet deck, lots of fun grindy Magic
[11:15 PM] Magnus: https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/2213524#paper
Emeria Titan  Deck
Emeria Titan deck list with prices for Magic: the Gathering (MTG).

[11:23 PM] h0p3: I've never seen that deck before. I am a fan of many of the cards in the deck. Attrition is gorgeous.
[11:23 PM] h0p3: Reminds me of Death & Taxes.
[11:24 PM] h0p3: Jesus, some of those cards are expensive.
[11:31 PM] Magnus: Ah yeah, most of the price comes from the Stoneforge/Sword of Fire and Ice package. It's super  cheap on MTGO though
[2:32 AM] h0p3: Your wife calls you The Abyssal. You don't happen to be a fan of the card "The Abyss" do ya? I love that card. Never seemed to be much of a viable card, but it's gorgeous.
[1:12 PM] Magnus: ah yeah! Super old black enchantments are some of my favorite cards in Magic. Chains of Mephistopholes and Contamination are good ones too
[1:14 PM] h0p3: Yes, indeed.
[1:15 PM] h0p3: Btw, I really enjoy looking at decklists and ideas. Feel free to spam me about magic. It won't be spam for me.
[1:15 PM] Magnus: haha sure thing
[1:16 PM] Magnus: I have been messing around with a decklist for Legacy that's mono black actually
[1:16 PM] Magnus: https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/2935749#paper
THE GATE  Deck
THE GATE deck list with prices for Magic: the Gathering (MTG).

[1:16 PM] h0p3: Is Dovin's Veto one of the player-made cards?
[1:16 PM] Magnus: hmmm I'm not sure
[1:19 PM] h0p3: That is a classic deck. I still have a version of it in our pile. My friend https://philosopher.life/#GB developed that list on https://mtgthesource.com/ for a long time. He eventually splashed white.
[1:19 PM] h0p3: I dont' know enough about the Legacy metagame to say anything about it.
[1:20 PM] h0p3: Seems well-suited to 2-for-1 attrition and developing CA.
[1:21 PM] Magnus: yeah, super grindy value Magic is my favorite for sure
[1:22 PM] Magnus: Cabal Therepist + Bitterblossom from that deck is so strong
[1:22 PM] h0p3: I can see that. We must be long-lost brothers, lol.
[1:30 PM] h0p3: http://www.mtgthesource.com/forums/showthread.php?16885-Deck-The-Gate
[Deck] The Gate
The Source
[1:30 PM] h0p3: Do you play Ritual because the format is fast enough that the deck isn't viable otherwise?
[1:31 PM] h0p3: It's not a suicide black deck, so it still seems out of place to me.
[1:31 PM] Magnus: I think the speed helps fight some of the unfair decks better for sure
[1:32 PM] Magnus: Sometimes T1 Thoughtseize isn't enough to stop Painter or Show and Tell
[1:32 PM] h0p3: Aye, lol.
[1:32 PM] Magnus: but T1 Thoughtseize plus Hymn is hard to recover from
[1:33 PM] Magnus: plus, if it ends up just sitting in hand, it can be discarded for Lili or Rankle
[1:38 PM] h0p3: I can appreciate that. It's rarely going to be virtual card disadvantage. It doesn't fit the control-heavy role of the deck; it's not ideal for when the deck is situated in metas where it's most viable. But, it might be necessary to force that tempo to face tier 1 decks, period.
[1:40 PM] h0p3: Goblins is a deck that should play in creature and control heavy formats. It can be built to fight combo, for example, but it doesn't really belong in such a meta. It's not easy to find a place where it's worth playing (for the sake of winning).
[1:41 PM] h0p3: Wasteland, Urborg, and Stronghold seem good.
[1:41 PM] Magnus: ah yeah, I would be playing Wasteland if not for the price tag xD
[1:41 PM] Magnus: even on MTGO it's expensive haha
[1:41 PM] h0p3: Ugh. =/ Sorry.
[1:42 PM] Magnus: haha no worries
[1:42 PM] h0p3: That card is much cheaper than it used to be. Interesting.
[1:42 PM] Magnus: I did just get that stimulus check though.... :thinking:
[1:42 PM] h0p3: hahaha
[1:42 PM] h0p3: Sheeeit. i hear that, lol
[1:43 PM] Magnus: probably shouldn't waste too much of it on Magic though xD
[1:43 PM] h0p3: If only we could, lol.
[1:45 PM] h0p3: I think I like deckbuilding the most and playing with the freetooling because I like the game without the economic collector's value, etc. I don't want to be hindered by the fact that I'm too broke to build $TAX that cost 5k, lol.
[1:45 PM] Magnus: yeah, I feel that lol
[1:45 PM] h0p3: Still, I like sticking it to the other players who have expensive decks with my pauper shit.
[1:46 PM] h0p3: Took down a SCG 5k once with a $100 deck (~300 players).
[1:46 PM] Magnus: aw that's great haha
[1:46 PM] Magnus: I've been using ManaTraders for playing MTGO, it's pretty useful actually
[1:47 PM] Magnus: just 10$ a month lets me rent up to 100 tickets worth of cards at a time
[1:47 PM] h0p3: Whoooa. This is blowing my mind. I've never seen deck-renting before.
[1:48 PM] h0p3: That is brilliant.
[1:48 PM] h0p3: Back when MTGO came out, there was none of this.
[1:48 PM] Magnus: right! Plus, you can upgrade your decks by buying some cards on the side
[1:49 PM] h0p3: Hell, you couldn't play most formats (and the cards in circulation were so limited in some respects that it warped formats).
[1:49 PM] h0p3: That makes sense, hopefully picking up staples along the way.
[1:50 PM] h0p3: They play any eternal formats at your cardshop (when no quarantines are in effect)?
[1:51 PM] Magnus: Not really unfortunately. It's mostly just Standard and EDH players
[1:51 PM] h0p3: Yup. Thems prolly the moneymakers for the cardshop.
[1:53 PM] h0p3: I started playing competitive magic back in Mirrodin, a broken age of Standard. Big dick cards and fast decks popped my cherry, and I never found the fairer, far more regulated, and slower forms of Standard that came after to be as fun. Eternal formats are just more beautiful to me.
[1:53 PM] Magnus: Ah yeah, original Mirrodin block was wild lol
[1:54 PM] Magnus: I started playing in Zendikar/Scars of Mirrodin Standard
[1:54 PM] h0p3: Ah. Noice. You pick up any fetches along the way?
[1:55 PM] Magnus: unfortunately not haha
[1:55 PM] Magnus: I did end up getting a playset of 7/10 shocklands in Return To Ravnica a couple of sets leter though
[1:56 PM] h0p3: Nice. Those aren't going anywhere, I assume. I am not a fan of the reserved list.
[1:57 PM] h0p3: I still use a shockland in my UR Delver because Volcanic is stupid expensive.
[1:58 PM] h0p3: $400, lmao
[1:58 PM] Magnus: yeah, it's pretty absurd
[1:59 PM] h0p3: If you only have one dual (I'm a fan of PoP in delver, so I don't want too many duals in the first place), maybe 1 out of 100 games will be lost because you took the extra 2 damage.
[2:00 PM] h0p3: I'll keep the $390, tyvm, lol.
[2:00 PM] h0p3: Has MTGO seen an increase in the playerbase since CV19 started wreaking havoc?
[2:01 PM] Magnus: I'm sure it has, that's why I'm on there
[2:09 PM] h0p3: I play magic with my offspring when I can. Been trying to get them to build some EDH lists (https://philosopher.life/#MTG%20Deck%3A%20EDH%20-%20Flash%20Hulk), but so far no dice. That format has changed a ton too, and I have no idea where to find data about the metagame. What are some of the more important places to read, practice, or think about magic on the web these days?

[11:19 AM] h0p3: https://i.redd.it/uochulgj2pu41.png
[2:59 PM] Magnus: lol
[2:59 PM] Magnus: I remember playing Magic in highschool
[6:28 PM] h0p3: I think that's one of my favorite parts of competitive magic, including online. It makes it easier to just play the game as it is.
