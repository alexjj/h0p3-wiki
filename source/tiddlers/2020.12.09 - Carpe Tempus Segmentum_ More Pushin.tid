title: 2020.12.09 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: More Pushin

Currently, it is common to hear in my house: "I need X, but I have no idea it is." It's less clusterfucky though. 

* Woke at 4:30
* Read+Write+//GoT//
* Noodles, Apple, and Water
* Brought a water jug down. We'll see how it works. 
* Read+Write
* Bugged my wife.
** She likes my freezing cold hands. It's her favorite.
** She got sleep, yo. Might not be amazing sleep, but it was enough. 
* We missed trash. It's on Wednesday, crazy early. It's piling up for us quickly.
* Fireman Time!
* Read+Write+//GoT//
* Woke offspring, gave directions. Everyone seems to be in a good mood, even Ranga. 
* Unpacking
* Nap
** Sweet baby jesus. That sleep hit the spot.
* Listened to sections of my wife's meeting.
** The characters fit. I am glad to be able to hear their voices realtime; it rounds out my models.
* Heater is switching on/off rapidly. Likely an air or overheating problem. 
** Maintenance scheduled, and we'll have monthly deliveries too.
* Unpacking
** I can't do the bathroom myself here, but it functions. My wife has to sort through what actually matters to her in this space. I'm happy to organize it though. 
*** 1 bathroom for 4 people means we need it hyperorganized. 
**** On top of the shower totes for each person. 
**** I'll be using the extra closet between [[1uxb0x]] and [[k0sh3k]]'s rooms for bathroom storage overflow.
***** At this point, every person will maintain their own bedding extras in their own room (though I will maintain some extra blankets at the top of this closet).
*** My son has been tasked with mounting an old shelf above the toilet for us. Let's see if he does the right thing.
** Kitchen is finally in working order, although I'm going have to redo it A to Z. We just need something that works right now.
*** Second shelf has been tremendous. We're placing the old shelf, the old pantry, and the dry ark onto these two. They fit like a glove too. Heat is the only concern I've got.
*** Drawers suck. My son has been offering suggestions on what we might do. Not sure yet. He makes good points though.
** The dining area is complete, and I don't see major adjustments coming. I'm glad our two small tables are thin yet long as this fits the space we have well. Using a small bookshelf and the window sill to hold our board games and [[MTG]] cards. 
*** There is some damage to the staircase area, but we knew that. Probably will use some kind of putty and paint. No reason to try to cut some custom wood (if [[JRE]] had tons of freetime and the desire, we might have a fun project to do cross-country).
** The living room now functions, and is also being used as a buffer zone for setting up bedrooms. 
*** I don't like any of the options. We're holding off on setting up a TV in there for now. That room is poorly designed for modern life, but this a WWII house.<<ref "s">>
** Some curtains hung, but I need to mount more. Gonna wait until the rooms are more in order though (that might annoy my wife, who cares more about her [[privacy]] here, but there are more important functions right now.
* Closed my eyes to rest for a bit. 
* Set up the big things with my daughter in her room, but she handled everything else.
** She's been pissed off that I've been birddogging her (I've been accused even when I wasn't; I know the feel). Irrational arguments and I don't want to argue because I'm convinced she's going to rationalize, and that will only make it worse for her (I can appreciate why she's feeling extra variance in her emotions too). Frequent accountability checks are just here, but I'd like to keep extending her the opportunity to own herself: it's up to her to do it without intervention. She did it! 
*** Good job.
* Snaked all drains. 
* Shopping @ W-Entity
** Picked up a shelf for my wife.
** Stamps, envelopes (can't find ours yet), some food
** Our cashier's name was Hope. She was clearly very tired. Had to ask to her to ring up the giant box after she rung us up, and she nearly forgot our stamps. She had a lot on her mind too. 
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Pizza, chicken, chips+salsa, beer, and coffee. Little bit of each. Scrounging. 
** [[MTG]]
*** [[1uxb0x]]'s MUC vs [[k0sh3k]]'s Paci, two games, both were despite double chants trying to force stick + Ostones wiping the board + my son's astute understanding or prediction of the need to drop a threat asap before he loses control of the game.
*** [[j3d1h]]'s Clamp-Affinity vs Leftover Red Affinity +2, +2, +1: lots of interesting mechanisms, and near-mirrors teach us a great deal. She's blocking too early and killing her development (she thinks she's in the control role when she's not, and even when she plays control, she's not squeezing advantages out correctly; but, even the experts play this deck wrong all the time in my experience [and this version is the most technical]), not relying upon clamp nearly enough, and she sacced out to ravager incorrectly (should have modulared onto flyers). Two of the games should have been hers, but the first had a double mull that just couldn't.
**** The redfinity build has 6 red sources. I am completely retarded.
*** [[1uxb0x]]'s MUC +2 vs Affinity: fascinating game. He almost broke me turn 1 on mana sources (as he did before), but a land rip off the top put me back in. Headfaked him out to land a clamp, and went hardcore through my deck (maybe 15 cards left by the end). He held two Ostones from the beginning (unknown to me until the end), and instead dropped a shackles (which was a pain, ofc). He missed many opportunities to prevent clamping. Had lethal on board, he O-stones, I puke another lethal board, he drops another but doesn't pop instantly, I'm allowed to continue to abuse clamp before swing, and he pops, I'm 13 cards in hand and puke another lethal board, no answer. Close game. 
* Shopping @ A-Entity
** Picked up a desk and a wardrobe. Cheaper than Ikea. 
*** My wife will be taking my desk and chair. I will finally have leg and elbow space after many years. 
* Continued some unpacking
* Read+Write

We aren't out of the woods yet, but we're getting there. I think we'll have a reasonably functioning house by the 18th, prepped for my wife's vacation, especially if we have more days like today. It's been an extremely productive day, and everyone was happier too. It made up for yesterday. My wife has been zinging the everliving fuck out of me. =D. It's too easy for her. She's pickin' on a retard, and she knows it.

Pretty fucking worried about eviction moratorium lifts and failing to flatten the curve. CT seems to be in somewhat better shape than most, but this place is not representative. It seems like a lot of my [[Root Users]] have found safety right before yet another wave of this giant storm. I am [[grateful]] for us, and I feel sick for others. I'm the alien here, but I think we need to hunt for aliens in need. Attic might become more important to construct sooner than I anticipated.
