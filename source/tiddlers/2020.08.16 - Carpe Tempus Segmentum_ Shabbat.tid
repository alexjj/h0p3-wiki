title: 2020.08.16 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Shabbat

* Woke at 1
** Ugh. Terrible fucking sleep. 
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Read+Write+Walk+Talk
* [[Family Time]] @ 2:30ish
* [[TTP]]s
** My wife handled most of it. Getting them into a groove in her work is still a higher priority to me. 
** Delivered my 30-minute wandering schizorant.  
* 1-on-1s
** Extended. It was closer to half an hour for each.
** Thought about [[hope]] with my son. I'm worried for him.
** My daughter was more snuggly than usual. She's been poking me a lot too.
* Discussions
** Owing responses to many
** Moving
** Accountability Hell
** Risk-assessment of the coming years
** Exchange student
** Living in a world of bots, npcs, and humans
** The New Glitch Art and Warfare of AI Cherrypickers
*** What it might be like to have 1k employees sculpting the net with it. Burning enemy resources.
*** Not that I will be able to tell (since I'm retarded), but many people still don't believe they will or are having encounters with bots at scale. Too uncouth to openly consider an interlocutor a bot or a shill.
** Wiki Triggerity
** JBOTextfiles with customizable UI sprankled on top 
* Reading Wikis
** I am growing more accustomed to having the ability to change UIs. We all are. 
** Short for my offspring, long for the adults. 
* Dinner
** Salad, apples, rice, chicken
** [[Family Log]]
*** My son has not completed the import.
* The Nightwalk
** Foggy, chilled. Offspring tended to walk ahead and turn around to meme with us.
*** They really are teenagers (well, he will be soon enough). 
** My wife is unhappy with how late it is, but once we are out, she's super comfortable.
** I'm sad to see that [[R]] has misunderstood my wife so thoroughly. 
*** It is very expensive to her identity to look at the truth here.
**** It is not fun to argue any normative topic with either of us, and my presence eliminates railroading.
*** They may need help. My predictions about her retirement years ago (A Bilbo Moment from her on the topic) are coming true. =/. Fuck.
** After all the heavy lifting, it's nice to finish with a meal and the happy-go-luckiness of the walk.
* LoL
