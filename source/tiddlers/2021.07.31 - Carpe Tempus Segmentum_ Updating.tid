title: 2021.07.31 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Updating

[[TTTOTW]]. Playing catchup. [[CDR]]s have been swirling for me. Playing whack-a-mole in life (in a good way). Watermelon. My wife accidentally picked a single one out that wasn't good (she felt bad, but, I think she has a fallible superpower). In any case: watermelon!

A Lightning Storm. A gift. Perfect. I am warm.

[[TTTOTW]]. Attempted sleep by 4.

Woke at 10. It was enough. Plus, it's already been a damned good day. Meditation. [[TTTOTW]].

Bugs. Then took her down to [[The Den]]geon. //Informeth The Men!// Deepkissing throws me into fits. It's overstimulating. Everything, including getting widow-maker-axe-kicked in the balls. Meditation. Shower of the gods!

Millennial toast. [[Magic]] the Gutentag channel do good work for us. [[Family Gathering]] not to clean the house (as is my usual request on such a day), but instead, to organize and audit [[Music: Library]]. Tears. I can't make it through [[awe]].level without it. Vapelyfe. Turned off washer/dryer/ac. Hiccups. Many proofs have failed, and we're correcting them. It imploded. It came tumbling down. =(.

[[TTTOTW]]. To the grind of sorting my [[music]]. God damn, this is a [[project]] I'm glad I get to do as an autist. It's hard to explain what the process means to me, especially in the context of the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱. I [[hope]] to become more articulate about the matter. Codificationist virtue-theoretic work is hard to be meta about correctly for the standard reasons, and I have made what feels like little or no philosophical progress in responding to it.

This year (maybe even starting two years ago), I've spent way, way more time listening to music not in [[Music: Library]]. It's done me a lot of good. The library is a metaphor, and it's emotionally built into my memory of this ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱, reading and writing. It's built into my memory of meatspace events, especially //The Walk// and [[Family Time]]. It's even built into how I feel about wandering outside, going out into the world, as a hiki.

Listening for [[poetry]] and what is unsaid even though it's communicated through other symbols is such a weird place. I'm definitely lost as an autist. Pain is especially interesting in this space, and I get to question the prioritizing nature of value and transformation. Heady talk. I don't know how to say it right, and...I never will, and...I'm not gonna stop trying, I hope. I'm still happy to be methodical here. I do see a story animated.

I like how my point of view isn't what matters except insofar as its fittingness is parasitic upon a pursuit of something not merely contingent yet somehow more salient than the necessary blocks that arise from even our own incompleteness and incoherence. WEIRD, I know. I recognize we are likely dust in the wind in most senses. I admire what Nietzsche was trying to communicate, and we can be [[grateful]] (especially as [[Straussian]]s) even while we know answer is still what he hated.

Elitism is a hard problem. The question of [[the right]] to and of [[power]], for picking out its [[FTO]] [[gfwiwcgws]]ess [[irwartfrr]] is an essential problem, and it is fundamentally why philosophy must be political (and, yet again, [[Saint Aristotle]] demolishes everyone [and Sir [[Strauss]] said it for him again too - however, defeating the [[privacy]] of gnosticism must be fleshed out in the open [as ultimately we cannot claim the truth is ours]), that crazy fucking lunatic<<ref "m">>). I have a bone to pick with most people who call themselves "pluralists." I don't think they've even remotely attempted to be charitable enough in their interpretations of [[The Great Human Conversation]] in most cases. [[The Beautiful]]'s mirror of normativity provides something critical to us in understanding the shape of merit (or, at least the process of coming understand what consists in merit).

I see autists and schizos (and comorbids) fucking everywhere in this music. What the fuck am I going to do with Debussy? To think [[Beauty]] is merely in the eye of any beholder like us is narcissistic hubris, anthropocentric to such a degree that it dishonestly aims to destroy metaphysics. It is not a pointless endeavor. It does mean something. OOO flattens, and if you go that direction, you have to be honest about it. Skepticism does require accepting the mystical components it relies upon, it must accept absurdity, bite the philosophical bullet without integrity at some point. It was never really rational. And, so here I come for the postmodern STEMlords. Liars, psychological egoists, Rand-Locke Memeplexpillers, Libertarians and Post-[[pleft]]ers who cannot (let alone do not) tell or perform Jesus' story, and all the other onions that have gone bad. It is conceptually impossible to not have an outgroup. This pluralist must still explain our accountability, it matters why they believe (or don't believe) that we are accountable. 

I'm having difficulty finding ML that can make use of my priorities, let alone understand them. I can't scale a data set up large enough.

Not too many contradictions yet where I go back on the direction of my previous judgment. 

Lastly, I'm finding it difficult to find music without rhythm that hits the spot right. It's crazy hard to do. The line between mere ambience and signal is blurry. Definitely have [[Saint Aristotle]]'s Calm in mind (not obviously in agreement!) as I fight against Schopenhauer. 

[[k0sh3k]] and [[5c0ut]] spent time with me downstairs. Grinding through music and laundry. [[1uxb0x]] made pizza for us all. =) Push! Also, backscratches.

Dance [[naked]].
