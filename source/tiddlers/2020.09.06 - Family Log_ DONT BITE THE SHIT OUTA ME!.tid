title: 2020.09.06 - Family Log: DONT BITE THE SHIT OUTA ME!

!! Write a paragraph summarizing each person's week:

* [[1uxb0x]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I found a new game I like. I plan to write about the game. Yeah, "Very poor" I completely failed. I think I'm really easy to scare now. Debatable has been fun.
** j3d1h
*** I enjoyed talking about Divarium and Rey with you this week. I'd love to talk about characters a lot more often! (If you have any questions, I'm happy to try and answer them.) I'm sorry this week didn't seem to go well for you. I hope you get enough sleep soon, but if you can't, using that time to read is a good idea.
** k0sh3k
*** I don't really know what to write about your week; I wasn't here, and I missed you terribly. Even when I got home, I was very tired and didn't get to talk much. But I did like hearing you debate in Debatable - you're debating skills are improving. I think having a looser format and letting you argue your actual opinion rather than having to take a side works better for you. I hope next week, you'll take better notes - both of your school work and your free time - so I can feel connected to you while I'm working!

*** [[1uxb0x]] enjoyed [[vidya]] [[games]], but he had a very poor school week. There is little evidence of //effort//. He's lost his machines for it, and he's going to need to find his way back to them. He's gotten some cleaning done in the house and helped make dinner several times. I'm excited to see him try to switch from vim to emacs. We continue to see the futility in trying to buy clothes for the manboy: he outgrows everything so quickly. I've been lucky to have several conversations with him, especially during [[Debatable]]. Overall, he had a pleasant week.

* [[j3d1h]]
** 1uxb0x
*** Wow you have like, infinite more work than I do! I think you've been a good friend. I don't remember all that much about your week.
** j3d1h
*** Talking to friends has been nice, even if we didn't always talk about pleasant things. It's good to have people I can talk to about //anything//, especially when they have a good guess at what life will be like for me. I got some serious art and character building done. It's exciting to see that I'm coming up with a lot of ideas and starting to develop them easily. I think I'm going to try reaching out to a few new people this week, because I'm finding more and more that seem worth the time (at least a little).
** k0sh3k
*** I really miss your Carpe Diems and Prompted Introspections; I feel like I don't know what you're up to all day. I did like the notes for the school work you did - I can tell you're digging into these subjects - and I liked talking to you about creative writing and ancient literature. Do you like your other subjects, too? What's your favorite subject? I miss you a lot while I'm at work; I would really like to see more of your WIP. I appreciate your being up and ready to start the day when I take off for work, too! Getting hugs from y'all before I leave sets me up for a good day.

*** [[j3d1h]]'s schoolwork was extant but underwhelming, and she's losing her phone for it. She's gotten some practical CS work done, and her room looks sane. She has been generous to her brother when it comes to chore allocation. Her good friends haven't been speaking with her as much, but she's been growing her friendships (and finding new ones). Discussions and walking with her have been a privilege. I'm hoping she'll jump back into her wiki.

* [[k0sh3k]]
** 1uxb0x
*** You had a lot of stress. We didn't realy have much human interaction this week. Did we even argue last debatable? Dang, must have been stress-filled to not have an RCL. I wonder if you'll make an extra RCL next week?
** j3d1h
*** Your prompted introspections have been significantly shorter this week, but I guess that makes sense. You've been very busy at work, and I'm glad you survived it (so far). It sounds like everyone else at work is faring well, too. I hope you've been getting enough rest and sleep. You probably need to walk a little less, since your legs are hurting this often.
** k0sh3k
*** This was a crazy rough week for me; I did so much physical work (which I'm really not used to doing) while still directing everyone else around me and being constantly busy that I was pretty consistently exhausted. NO SPOONS. Working while wearing a mask all day is hard - I feel like I can't get a full breath if I'm walking or talking - but sewing in the nose pieces did help with my glasses falling down and fogging. I discovered some important things - I need to eat my snacky lunch later in the afternoon than I usually do, or I'm too hungry to wait for dinner when I get home. BUT - the snacky lunches do fill me up enough as long as I eat breakfast and wait to eat lunch until 2pm or so. For the first time in a long time, I decided not to do an RCL for the week - I just didn't have it in me.
** h0p3
*** [[k0sh3k]] has had a helluva week! It's been no joke, broski: crazybeans. She's a pillar. She's been the boss + 10x engineer, and she's been extremely practical. She is a gift to all who know her. She's been so busy that she wasn't even able to write her formal curriculum (I miss it). She's been sacrificing. She comes home from work and spends her time with her family (which is enormously expensive); she's spending spoons hardcore. She's emotionally and physically exhausted, and her sleep has never been more crucial. I think this has been one of the hardest weeks she has had in a while. She's been looking at housing too, and that's been a blessing. Reading has been fun but also emotionally expensive for her. Skintime, walks, meals, and //American Gods// with her have been highlights of my week.

*** 
** j3d1h
*** Yeah, I totally glossed over that log. Didn't process or wrestle with a word of it. I don't see why the wind would want to go faster. Do //you// enjoy being flung at high speeds, constantly having to dodge anything and everything in your way? Again, I'm really glad you talk to AIR more often recently. I'm far less glad to see //what// you're saying. Y'all disgust me, lol.
** k0sh3k
*** You have been very thoughtful about my days and have helped make home a restful place to be - thank you!  (ง'̀-'́)ง is cute. I promise I'm trying to be quiet in the morning. :( I think I know how to finish your cicada; I just have to wait for the parts. Soon, I promise! I'm glad you're talking to so many people now!
** h0p3
*** [[h0p3]] feels a bit like that dog in the house that is on fire. It's fine. LoL has been great to watch, and he's been reading+writing plenty. Time with family has been grounding. Thoughts of moving and the whirlwind of the world roars in his head. He's hanging in there, as usual.
