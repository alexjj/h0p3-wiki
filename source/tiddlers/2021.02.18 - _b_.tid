Release the Central Bank fiat stablecoin and keep the ~~Party~~ Ponzi going! 

In my offspring's lifetimes, most interest rates for increasing liquidity/velocity have never gone up (with no consensus on why either), and maybe Japanification.trap is it (our culture is just as fucked up, though we aint an island with as much scarcity, and we don't save that hard). I still don't fucking understand why I'm not seeing inflation rise faster. Yes, there is some, alongside supply side strains (and perhaps housing costs will continue to rise, though surely there has to be a dip when moratoriums lift). What the hell am I missing? Fed's mandate for employment has switched from "full" to "maximum" (which is demasking code for: fuck the poor). 

What is this code for: I canâ€™t get too excited about anything happening now because I'm so excited about what should be happening in the future? Some kinda FOMO. That zen live in the present be-your-no-selfedness. Until one dies, desire toward what telos? It is always external, future-oriented. What do you long for? Get it right.

I've been feeling the dominoes of silence around me. Sometimes it is a warm blanket. Sometimes it is confirmation. Sometimes it is unknown, uncertain, a place to be [[hope]]ful and listen, beyond poetry into the quietist's fideistically [[stoic]] ritual. The amount that has been poured in [[Readme]]'s tree is non-trivial, though it needs to be further hierarchicalized. My {[[Axioms]]} are prioritized and still shine brightly to me. [[FTO]] is now a skimmer, explorer, fisher, granting the opportunity for folks to demonstrate they are going to commit to putting their skin in the game with me even 10% as much as I will (and, as a NEETard with a massive pile of shit, that's expensive to match). I have been [[lucky]] to meet those who I've met.
