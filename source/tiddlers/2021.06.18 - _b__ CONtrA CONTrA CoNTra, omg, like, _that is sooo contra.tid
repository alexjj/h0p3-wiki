As a non-LARPing and hilariously idiosyncratic [[Straussian]] interpreter of Straussianism (mo' dimensions, mo' problems), I can agree with you that most people consider public political debate to be about sophistically persuasive 'winning' rather than justifiably pursuing what matters, including truth, but, we should not claim public political debate cannot be at least largely honest (you need an argument for that), right? No matter how paranoically charitable we are, the grandmasters were simply wrong about the privatization of philosophical discourse, treating the vulgar masses and riffraff as mere means. I have what many would consider to be esoteric writing (I want to vomit), but the fundamental thrust of this mystical work is not some winking dogwhistle (though I go there too, Lincoln). I aim to reach the fitting audience while remaining quite direct from the beginning (and, if we are stuck with the irony, then what could be more [[Straussian]] than that?...it's like Rick and Morty S04E03esque). Celebrate low-culture, the proletariat, the commoner and the commons in whatever retardspeak ya got. From experience, I've found that honesty is usually all the cover I need; who would want to make sense of that? Performative legibility is perhaps even more rhetorical than we'd like.

What were the last 10 sub-disciplines (or hybrids, or sub-sub, etc.) spunoff from academic Philosophy^^tm^^? Only an evil moron believes the practice merely shits out tools that shit out facts. It's unforgivably absurd to maintain MacIntyrian positivism while claiming there's a good way to do philosophy.

From an evopsych perspective, attraction is a key crutch stepping-stone motivator bridge into [[The Golden Rule]]. An instinctive graceful charity qua [[The Beautiful]] when one otherwise might not elect to do what is right serves many purposes (it's almost natural virtue), including allowing us to reflect upon what we are missing.

Almost autologically and perhaps [[ITS]], asserting "[[weird flex|https://i.imgur.com/kDVPFmM.gifv]]" is a weird flex most of the time.

Giving those who were sent to prison for selling drugs their own licenses and means of production for legally selling newly legalized drugs, from farm to dispensary, would be a non-trivial attempt at reparations for their enslavement. It's closer to a genuine apology, but hardly complete. Let's not forget to eliminate their revolving criminal justice debt 'owed' to private debtors prisons long after release and used as pretense to reincarcerate them.
