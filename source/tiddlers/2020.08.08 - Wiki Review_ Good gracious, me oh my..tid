title: 2020.08.08 - Wiki Review: Good gracious, me oh my.

* [[2020.08.07 - Wiki Review: Cement]]
** Not that they will have devices by the end of the year, lol. Good gracious, me oh my.
* [[2020.08.07 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Thoroughly Memey]]
** It feels like my [[Root Users]] are all climbing up their mountains in life. Ups and downs, but feels like more up than down (despite the absolute insanity of 2020). 
* [[2020.08.07 - TDL: Keep Calm & Deal Tons Of Damage]]
** The essentials and the most pleasant options satisfied. 
** I ended up letting my daughter off the hook just to jump into art. We had fun talking about it.
*** I don't seem to connect well with most philosophers, and, maybe, it will be difficult for her to connect with most artists. I have no idea how any of this works.
* [[2020.08.07 - Prompted Introspection: One Of]]
** Completed. Maybe in a year? I doubt it. I could go for a pinephone, but I'm just not convinced it has the battery muscle (and while my daughter pointed out we could just build our own custom battery brick, that isn't worth my time).

** In several ways, my son benefits from being the youngest. There are aspects of his life that are simply more put together than my daughter had at his age. It's good that the guinea pig oldest child tends to have the most resources. They need it.

** We should work toward empiricism into method and then find a way to bridgemap onto what a scientist actually does in a given field. 
* [[Text Art: ASCIIpasta]]
** Shit I wish I had been collecting since I was a boy. `/sigh` - 覆水难收
** There's other styles I'm missing too. I'm just going to take it easy though. Just fun.
* [[Text Art: Alphabets & Numerals]]
** Cleaned up. This is much easier to grab from. 
** If I actually needed to use it often, I would script it out. Lame AF, I do it by hand until I know it has to be automated.
* [[Text Art: Blockndotpasta]]
** The line between text and pixels is surely complex and blurry for someone like me.
