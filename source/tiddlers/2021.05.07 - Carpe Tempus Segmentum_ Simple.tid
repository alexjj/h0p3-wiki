title: 2021.05.07 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Simple

The Thieves of Plato's Cave: Den of the Unholy of Unholies. Naming seems off, but also not. It's cool. I love it. Wandered a lot of topics, but it was 12:30, and that was too late. Yikes. It was fun. I won't bug them until 1pm tomorrow, at least. What about Wednesdays? Perhaps a bookclub is in order. I do not know. It grows. We like it. It works. 

Woke. Deep sleep. Extended Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Got to chat with my [[ᛝLightᛝ]]. 

Dialectures. Assignments. Cleaning in garage. Stored car. ⁸Δ⁸.

Talked with [[JRE]]. Reynolds interview. Eyesore fix on the deck, lattice. Working on a cast iron antique piece for MIL. The jokes that don't land are the most important ones sometimes. Diaper rash. Jenner interviews. Speaking with Jonathon's friend (paranoid for many of the same reasons). Need to send a picture. Phone died right before.

Pulled into magic games. Losers.

She came down. Talked. I took a while. //Inform the Men!// Meditation. [[TTTOTW]]. 

[[Family Gathering]], with [[k0sh3k]] on her couch ("reading" `/nod`). My son made fishsticks and cut up apples for us, tatertots too. I had water. Bro told us about his job. This one is much better. Treat him right, don't run him ragged, and he'll even have a lot of down time to read. Perhaps it will be all 3 brothers that read a fuckton at work.

Finished our match (clean), then my daughter demanded another match. She wants to play. =D. Dope. She had the CoW+Strip Mine combo all three games (the first one, she just demolished me, and I was lucky to Elspeth ulti and eventually stabilize with disk [and more technical shit]). Chitchat. 

[[TTTOTW]] and watching //What We Do in the Shadows// con mi hermano. 

I got to talk with everyone today. It was awesome.
