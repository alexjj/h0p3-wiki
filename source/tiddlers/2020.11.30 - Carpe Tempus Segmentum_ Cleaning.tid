title: 2020.11.30 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Cleaning

* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
* Cleaning
** We're behind on kitchen.
* Read+Write+//GoT//
** God damn, I need to walk! My back feels wrong. I'm antsy. Being in the house isn't enough.
* Sleep by 6:30
* Woke at 2:15
** Whoa, slept later than I anticipated. I dreamt so hard though. I woke myself up laugh from a joke. I don't remember the joke. I can't recall having been humored inside of my dreams before. That's neat. 
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Read+Write+Walk+Talk
* Planning dinner, asked offspring to sit with me since we couldn't walk (heavy storms).
* Completely forgot my wife was home. I'd have rushed to her. 
** My wife's head wasn't killing her, but she didn't sleep as well (anxiety about work, understandably). 
* Landlord contacted us: a friend of hers wants to see the place for renting. If her friend wants the place, we can be released from the lease immediately. That's a couple grand of rent we wouldn't have to pay. 
** House is not a wreck, but it's not in the shape that sells it. We have to make the tour worthy. Every room must be cleaned by 3pm tomorrow. 
* Commander Mode Engaged
** Makes my daughter extremely unhappy. I get being unhappy about having to work. That's not it though. It's something else. Irrational attitudes will be deconstructed. Doesn't want to talk about it, and I'm not going to force her to speak at this point. She says I won't listen, and we talk about that too. She knows exactly what she's saying, and she knows exactly how I'm going to respond. It is true: changing my mind is incredibly difficult, and that is not what she means. Doing what I can to buy her space while making sure the obligations to the household are met.
*** My wife says her responses are to be predicted. This is standard 14yo girl-woman feelings and behaviors. I am the mom in the trope-relationship-dynamic, and I need to go with it. 
* Downstairs cleaned
* Bounced between people
* Offspring made dinner
** My daughter agreed she will be speaking with people and writing about her feelings and thoughts. She does not have to speak with me about it, but she should not face it alone. 
** [[k0sh3k]] talked about her day. It's been hell. It's obvious she's on her own and forced to do the work of dozens of part-timers. 
*** One of the difficulties is that in order for her to signal that things will be late, she would have to give up coming home afternoon 3 days a week. That may need to occur eventually, but we will see. It's chaos.

* Cleaning with my son (my daughter refused my help, and that's okay). "I've got it. I don't want your help."
** The screen is broken. We taped it up and put it in the garage. 
** Am I disappointed? Yes. Terrible memories (and my offspring do not remember well enough). I think my offspring and I are the only people who know how many hours and units of energy have gone into dialectures here. It is immorality at this point.
*** It's better than last year though. The room semi-functions (though the desk does not). 
*** Pushed 80% with him and left the remainder for him (did not finish it, `/sigh`).
* Trying to compromise with and build space for my daughter to do her thing as best I know how. She held me and I held her as she cried. I don't know what to do.
