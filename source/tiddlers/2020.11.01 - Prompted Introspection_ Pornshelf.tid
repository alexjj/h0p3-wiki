!! If you were a book, in which section of the bookshop would you be shelved? Which genre are you most drawn to?

I don't think you'd find me in a bookshop. I avoid them. I make huge mistakes with my savings account there. That place is stupidly addictive. I'm filled with lust, greed, envy, [[arrogance]], etc. in them. If I didn't have a moral problem with it, my {[[dream]]} would be to have a well-curated and highly-organized library house (the pornography section would be godly). I am going to shoot for chalkboard paint again; that's cheap enough. Books are a sign of wealth and more to me. It's not rational enough. My desire is not justified. Don't fucking let me go inside a bookstore. I'm going to clam up trying to control myself or I will fail to control myself entirely, and it's not fair to my wife either ('cause part of her is feeling: "well, yeah, let's get books..."). It's like a candy shop (new books smell even better though). I can't trust myself, and that ruins the fun.

The question is relevant to this [[ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱]] though. I would like to find my pile of words in webarchives of [[The Great Human Conversation]]. I hope my offspring will keep a copy with them. It's cheap to copy data, and I think it could poorly fit on a number of shelves/harddrives/tags/collections. Autobiography is probably the best fit.

I'm most drawn to pornography. I can't get enough of it. Sadly, I have to force myself to look at what matters most, [[WINTCIS]]. Titties tho, I have to force myself to stop looking at them. I could watch people fucking for hours each day if I let myself. It's what I dream of in the world. Even in the supermarket, I'm undressing people and watching them fuck each other in my head. I've had multiple people ask me if I would write sci-fi, but I would much prefer to write smut (y not both?). I'm not creative or skilled enough, and I'm too autistic (it's also not what I'm here to do). It's like music, I'd much rather just consume what others have crafted.
