title: 2020.08.21 - Prompted Introspection: The Stories of Our Lives

!! What is something that can be important to you in a friend?

[[2019.11.18 - Prompted Introspection: LGH]] ripped the original question apart, and I've taken the latter half too literally (as my daughter will point out). I've modified the question, but it's still not rock solid. Maybe it can be ironed out in time. There's so many caveats required, especially since what it means to be my friend scales with our circumstances. 

As I've curled up<<ref "2021.08.22-1">> in the past couple months and slowed down my check-ins, as I've experienced the growth of Discord's integration and the summarization [[prompt]] in [[Family Log]], and as I've practiced quietness (not my instinct in many cases), I feel a big difference between the friends of mine who actually consider my wiki (even when there's nothing to say) on a weekly basis (or when they can) and those who don't even glance at it. It's weird to feel closer to strangers (or people who were strangers to me within even the past few years) than to people who I've known well (though that doesn't mean they've known me well) for decades. It's important to me that we care (which is a far cry from agreement or enjoyment) about each other's stories.
