Do you correct your boss or teacher regularly (often silently)? Do you hate groupwork? Are you regularly horrified by how often you find yourself the most competent person in the room? Would you rather read on the porch than have sex in the grass? Yeah, gril, larp that worksona. Get dat paper. Thank you. While you read, lemmeatchassho.

Delusional Disorder, MC. Patient exhibits behavior that he is ''one'' important person. Patient is in a state of mind in which he believes that he is responsible for saving or assisting [[others]]. Patient claims that when individuals begin to relate to one another as peers, rather than a master/slave dynamic, the 'higher layers of order' (?) respond with more simple and beautiful symmetries and patterns of interaction. Holds a belief that he is destined to ~~try to~~ become a ~~justifiably useful person to others~~ savior. More treatment is recommended. 

With each word we build a ladder into the cosmos toward the ideal at the end of time. What is the point of the power of naming our self-replicating masks of the void collapsing into our own individuated blackholes? With what substance do we alter the very source code of our being? What definitions are not heretical? What images are not idols?

Dumping used needles here.

I heard a Ragged Christian once.
He came in stout and tired.
They say he walks the desert now.
But where we never knew.

Let the silence be messiah.
Bring your light and dreams.
Cast your future into the well of time.
See your reflection in a mercurial appearance of truth.
Let our vortices collide into an apocalypse of bliss.

So, what do you think about a coconut cream cake fuck fight? 
I wanna smear it in and lick it out.
