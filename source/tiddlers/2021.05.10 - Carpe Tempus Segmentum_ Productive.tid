title: 2021.05.10 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Productive

Forgot. Transplanting from Sabbath. I have to work my way out of the habit. Might not be worthwhile. We'll see.

Woke at 2:30. Sweet. Tubes. Beer + Potato Salad. ~~The Dream.~~ Lazy, hiki scrolling through vidya. Back to sleep. Woke at 10. Meditation. [[TTTOTW]]

Participated in my wife's service. It was solid. I'd attend her church, but probably only hers. She's so good at inviting different perspectives while obviously being an expert. My offspring have no idea the luxury they live with in her class except by knowing the difference in style between my violent schizo-rabbitholed waterfall and her still waters with fittingly spaced stepping stones. 

Inform the Men! Meditation. Shower of the gods! 

Took my offspring to get shoes and clothes. Discussions there were good. Thinking about their friends. A special moment seeing our old residence. My daughter ended up not getting anything, and my son just wanted shoes. Aight. Drive back was unfun. I even pulled the car over for a minute. Same topic, as always, Pinky. What are we going to do?

[[Family Time]]. Raining, and my wife's head was not up for it ([[j3d1h]] didn't want to either, or at least not with me :P). It flew by. We went through everyone's [[Yearly Cross-section]]s too. 

A car accident right outside our house (technically a highway, and it's not safe). They were okay (shook up, understandably), met our neighbor for the first time. Told them we'd be inviting them over for dinner when quarantine was over (when* being the operative word). 

Junkfood and //The Office//. //Skintime// on my dungeonbedcouch^^tm^^. She hates that mattress (she cray), but she loves me. [[5c0ut]] joined us downstairs (a quiet party, I think).<<ref "m">> She left, he gave me XOXOs, and I fell asleep.

Woke at midnightish. Fireman Time! Cleaning. [[TTTOTW]]. Rick and Morty is coming. Looks like it's downhill from here bois. That's the way of it. Dark chocolates of both kinds. [[TTTOTW]]. 

Bugged her. She seemed alright. I couldn't stay awake. Slept, but woke a few hours later. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

Laundry, cleaning, dialectures. Offspring will be the end of me. My day brightened though. Seems like Kevin is taking his PTO from another state and won't be back often. Seems like a plus to me. She's packed her schedule, another book club today. She's an addict. Tight neck too, and I couldn't pop her back. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time x2! More laundry and cleaning. 

[[JRE]] called otw to pickup offspring at daycare. He's tired, anxious about starting the new job. It's never a competence issue, but socializing with these people long-term, yeah. =/. I know that feel, bro. It's obvious our memories are fading. His window metaphor seems apt. Talked a bit about [[/b/]] and the conversation ended. Not much time. I'm very glad he called. [[Rb]] has her masters in a medical/social field, but is fairly disheartened after the past 4 years (she has helped thousands of immigrants; we are lucky she exists). She's going into radiology instead. I'm surprised. She's so god damn good at her job. Can't move to another state though given the legal issues of fostering.

//The Walk//. It was very quiet. She identified plants many times along the way. I maintained my retarded repose. Took the long route. =). 

Started up dinner. Gave her a massage. //Skintime//. Normally, my blanket soaks up the oil, but I prefer direct transmission. Finished up dinner while [[5c0ut]] talked about work. I think it's going well for him.

[[Family Gathering]], kielbasa, onions, kraut, roasted potatoes, yellow squash, whiskey. We played //Cards Against Humanity//. I topdecked, read ev-er-y-thing slowly (exceptwhenIreadthemasfastasmydaughterinimitationwithzeropausesforlaughter), and chose everything at random. I came in second despite that. I've decided my wife is a cheater. My daughter was annoyed that I wasn't taking the game seriously, but we thought about what it meant to take ~~apples 2 apples~~ this pile of conventions srsly.

//Skintime// + //The Office//. [[TTTOTW]].
