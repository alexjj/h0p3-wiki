How's life going? New phone?
Aug 21 5:01pm
Hey. New phone, yep
Aug 21 6:59pm
I'm mentally preparing myself for a hard conversation
Aug 21 6:59pm
In about fifteen minutes, I will be introduced to a failed-to-launch artist who lives a couple of blocks over
Aug 21 7:00pm
His friend stopped me as Selah and i were walking home
Aug 21 7:01pm
He wants me to give him an in
Aug 21 7:01pm
Showed me a sample of his work
Aug 21 7:01pm
Its terrible
Aug 21 7:01pm
I agreed to meet him.
Aug 21 7:01pm
His other friend is 'genius' script writer. Spielburg-level. Great ideas. Never produced a thing.
Aug 21 7:02pm
God help me
Aug 21 7:02pm
Yes, sir. That sounds incredibly expensive. -=[ Rabbitholed ]=-. I will pray now for you. "Dear God, I don't know what I'm supposed to say right now. I'm sorry. Forgive us, and help us do the right thing, in the right way, at the right time, and for the right reasons. Give us wisdom, God, more than we deserve to know. Please tell us what to do. We are listening. Please help us. Amen."

Oh, it was an hour well spent. The artist never showed up, but we invited our neighbor who initiated and he started talking about his life. Mental illness, and a fear of sleeping away from his room has kept him somewhat paralyzed. We talked about Jesus, prayer, strip clubs, and purple weed.
Aug 21 8:08pm
Hope we'll have him over again
Aug 21 8:08pm
Thank you for your prayer.
Aug 21 8:09pm
Honestly, when he stopped us and started inviting his artist friend into our lives, I was a little annoyed on the inside. But when he started opening up, looking into his eyes, it was hard not to love him.
Aug 21 8:10pm
You have fascinating neighbors in your neighborhood.
Aug 21 9:58pm
How does a conversation about strip clubs go with you? Lol.
Aug 21 10:01pm
I've been to a strip club. Played pool, drank beer, saw titties.
Aug 21 10:11pm
These are the things that you do at the strip club
Aug 21 10:12pm
That is true, lol.
Aug 21 10:12pm
He was talking about how a buddy of his and he were at the strip club talking about Jesus. How his mode of feeling closest to Jesus is when he's most engaged in his "débauche "

"Be a sinner and sin﻿ boldly,﻿ but believe and﻿﻿ rejoice in Christ even more boldly, for he is victorious over sin, death, and the world."
Aug 21 10:15pm
Is that Luther?
Aug 21 10:15pm
He's a dork.
Aug 21 10:15pm
Yeah.
Aug 21 10:16pm
Heh
Aug 21 10:16pm
Also, I have new emojicons for the occasion: ( • )( • )ԅ(‾⌣‾ԅ)   ---- [-c°▥°]-c (‿ˠ‿)
Aug 21 10:17pm
We're having a mini road trip tomorrow, so Selah and I are gonna go to bed soon. Hope we can catch up soon.
Aug 21 10:17pm
Haha
Aug 21 10:17pm
You're kind of a genius, you know?
Aug 21 10:17pm
Lol. I need the line squiggles that makes me giggles.
Aug 21 10:18pm
Ttyl, sleep well!
Aug 21 10:18pm
Hee, you too!
Aug 21 10:19pm
