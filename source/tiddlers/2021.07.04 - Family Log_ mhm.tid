*** \( ﾟヮﾟ)/
**** :)
* j3d1h
** Lots of cramps for no apparent reason.
*** I mean, there is a reason. 
**** Dehydration?? Sure; let's call it that. 
**** The Big Bang.
*** -
* k0sh3k
** Fine; tired, crampy. Stress headache today. 
*** What does "fine" mean?
**** Not terrible. 
***** I'm glad. 
**** Usually something like an amount of money you owe to a government enitity.
* h0p3
** Felt like time has gone by so quickly.
* 5c0ut
** started out high stress but calmed down. 
*** ヘ( ^o^)ノ＼(^_^ )

!! What was interesting to you last week?

* Learning W-entity has a pretty in-depth training program.
* I've been extra snarky, I think.
* A Nationalistic church.
** Boooooo
* The library did not fall apart while I was on vacation! 
** They are a keeper.
* Pandemic restrictions continue to lighten up. Hurrah! 
* Scored some truly excellent books. 
** We've never owned anything even close to any as expensive as these. Those are books we've only been able to use inside a library. Kinda thinking the upstairs may one day just be filled with books (even as decorations, ofc*).
*** <3 
*** There was a cyanide and happiness episode with books that were empty and just had titles and such. I wonder if that kinda thing actually exists (probably does.)
* Tail-end of the week, my [[CTS]] wanes.

!! Outside of our immediate family, who did we have significant social interactions with? 

* Smokey & Mooshie, Butter, `lily;-;`, corly, Ferrin, Melo, Tea, Q&A, matoune, Nexus, GGG, Felter, Dede
** What did Butter think of your critique of the 4th of July service?
*** He keeps understating what a travesty it is, but he agrees that it's bad.
* Randoms
* Some crazy fucking schizos straight out of SoTS (`/salute`), Troglodyte (maybe we will continue to grow a relationship?), [[Root Users]], graemebarrett (and, like the Borat AMA, I'm begging for him to call me retarded...the highest honor I could receive). 
** So basically, Randoms.
*** Not to me. I've followed and interacted with these people with sufficient significance. 
**** They were randoms, but now they're ex-randoms
***** We are all [[/b/]] to each other at some level.
****** h0p3, the rest of us //have// friends.
* Emma, Dotty, JRE, Debby, Jillian, Omar, Q, Mary.
** Is Mary doing alright
*** she hasn't responded to my last text seeing if she wanted to hang out. will see if she still wants to talk.
* Drs. Collins & Attridge; Jodie S.; pplz interested in my Canvas site; Chris A. 
** You speak with the dissident? 
*** Not yet.

!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family (including ourselves)?

* 1uxb0x
** I'm glad to hear you interacting with people more. thnk you for cleaning out the fridge it looks amazing!
**  Your [[/b/]]'s are sick, breh. You are a great [[/b/]]keeper. Keep going, sir. `/salute`. Throw down in there.
*** Thank you for the compliment
*** yo stop stealing my joke you are misusing my property
** I appreciate that you feel the gravity of the problem of [[privacy]]. You are extremely thoughtful, and these problems are hard to understand. You do a good job.
** Thank you for helping me carry in the books!
** I like what I've seen so far in your comparison of Chasing the Stars and Othello - it's obvious you kept Othello in mind while reading the novel. I look forward to your paper! 
** I liked my thoughts on the innovations in technology.
** I like being able to chat with you about things that one (or maybe both) of us don't care about, and making it fun.
* j3d1h
** I've only been getting snarkier over the years.
*** One day, I'll actually have //improv// skills.
** I'm continuing to be more okay with making unfinished, unpolished, and intentionally-not-perfect art. (i.e. not stressing the hell out about 3 pixels.)
** your artwork keeps well in the fridge.          Your art work keeps getting better and better. thank you for being an ear.
** I appreciate that you've been taking dishes out of your room without any intervention. All responsible and shit.
*** SOMEONE KEEPS REPLACING MY WORDS. ~~WINNER~~ <---just like that (WINNRARRRR).mmmmm
** I enjoyed thinking about the concepts of money and extrinsic value with you and your brother this week. We had some good conversations in [[The Den]]
*** shut
**** (◥▶ ͜ʖ ͡◀◤)
**** Shut
***** `/hands-on-hips`
** That was a really good save just right now, finding the leak and patching it. Thank you.
** I had fun doing more world-building-thinking with you this week. 
** I like how willing you are to help your friends with their questions; you routinely go looking for answers rather than just saying, "I don't know." That's a good friend skill to have. 
** Thank you for helping me understand the script better.
* k0sh3k
** I am proud of myself for walking out of church when it was called for. 
*** That is an expensive thing to do.
** I appreciate how you are aware of how much time you spend on the boobtube and how you regularly make the commitment to read instead. 
*** Also, we all benefit from your reading so much. It's absurd.
** Thank you for putting on your warpaint and going back into the thick of it, into the wilderness of capitalism. You are our meatspace champion.
*** You are our meatspace champion can be taken out of context so well.
**** Stahppit 
** You make do with what we have to eat in a joyful way. You don't mind. You are an example of [[grateful]]ness to our offspring. You have a restricted diet that makes it harder too, and we're lucky to understand what it means to wrestle with our desires in watching you handle what life has thrown at you with grace.
** Thank you for trying out churches.
*** And for handling nationalism.
** you have made sure to invite me to hangout with you and h0p3 or for family times.
*** <3 
** You make yourself incredibly difficult to dislike.
* h0p3
** I like that my offspring can let it rip with me. We've earned spaces of trust that are extraordinarily hard to accomplish, imho.
** Thank you for my Dunder Mifflin mug; it is my favorite Sunday mug, now. :) 
** We spent a lot of time together this week, and it was cool (literally; the dungeon was the best place for most of the week). But you also made sure to give me space when I needed it, too. Thank you. 
*** To be fair: I prefer when we are artificially sweaty, sweety.
** Thank you for helping us with the family log and Etherpad.scout was here
** thank you for your for the understanding, mercy, and encourgment in helping me to get to where I can and need to be. 
** thank you for helping think about how to get better at my job, portfolio, technics, stencils.
** Thanks for getting me remotely into music.
* 5c0ut
** I like the challange i have infornt of me to get better at cake decorating.
** I didn't see you often this week, but when I did it made me happy.
** I think it was supercool that you continued helping your coworker with computer stuff even when Dot was snarky about it. You like to help people, and you don't care if it's "appropriate" or not  - you know that it's always actually appropriate to care for others. 
** I appreciate how you've identified who to learn from at the bakery. You're quick to master.
** Talking with you in particular feels like a break from the world, almost a sort of pause button.
