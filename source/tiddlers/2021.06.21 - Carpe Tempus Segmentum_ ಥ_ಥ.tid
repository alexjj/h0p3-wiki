[[5c0ut]] and I shot the shit, thought about life. It's what we do. Noice. Dark chocolate, vapelyfe, looked at the window (took it out), trying to cool it off. 

Laundry. 

One of the quiet joys of being a privileged #grownassman is actually owning and using multiple hammers to get the job done. Whoever sealed these windows never intended to open them again. Keeping the parts though, maybe we'll need it. I'm wondering if the slab of rock beneath this window was ever used for an AC unit. Used up my pipefitter's giant stainless steel, L-piece (a nasty quick fit for pieces that SS exclusively), to hold it in place. Cut the insulation pieces, filed them down, and taped it up. It's ugly and imperfect, but it works. My very own glorified de-humidifier. 

Cat is tearing up the catdoor. It's a not a good one. At least it allows people to sleep.

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time!

Saw her. Squeezes. Tried to sleep, but I couldn't. Got back up. Binging on [[m16]] like only an autist can. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! x2

[[Family Time]]. A chance to help some dissidents as digital librarians arose. A {[[dream]]} I have had for over 10 years might be coming true, back when I used to rip software from seminary libraries to distribute to those who didn't have money for that shit. Now, we have access to the largest single repository in the target language on the planet and the person to feed it to. Someone risked their life to do that.

Woke at 1:30? Felt like I'm missing at least a cycle, but it's enough.

[[TTTOTW]]. Chill with broski and Vapelyfe. A family of crickets roars into our room. Ranga came for pets and kitty krack.

Noodles with dried mushrooms, mandarins, water, vapelyfe, LolVod. I feel like Cypher. Also, I just realized that I won't be able to require my offspring to walk with me this week. =(. Welp. I am glad we have [[Family Time]]. 

Oh, a bite. Cool. Let's see where it goes. [[TTTOTW]]. Attempted sleep by noon. Woke at 5? Meditation.

Chilled with each of my offspring since I didn't get walk with them, ಥ_ಥ. My son walked me through his SCP FPS metagame (his room is looking better too). My daughter spoke of playing MC with Butters (who may have a [quite reasonable] crush on her [okay, maybe 60% chance]: he may have given you those mats because he likes you...like that), and he's a good dude (his volunteer work is practical and significant, and he treats others with respect, regardless of who they are [it doesn't hurt that he's pretty smart too]).<<ref "h">> 

//The Walk// with mi amor. She had a lot on her mind. About halfway through it was all good though. Also, blazing hot out. She's flushed. We dumpsterdove for this metal chair. It's cute. Oh, and the GILF neighbor that is clearly tied to the police near the first dead-end we take (the lambo), her daughter asked us a question, and it was clear we weren't paying attention to any loud noises she was picking out for us (though we heard her just fine), mostly just each other, and her response was, "oh, you two are off in your own little world, aren't you?"

//Inform the Men//. Meditation. 

[[Family Gathering]]. [[5c0ut]] made an Asian-fusion meal, but I wouldn't know what to call it. Reminds me of Vietnamese and Thai food. He used the hotpot to great effect; he knows how to use peanuts. [[5c0ut]] still hasn't been allowed to fill out a W2 and may attempt to not pay him at all, so he's prepping for that. $17.50 full-time at W-Entity is still alienation, but it aint nothing.<<ref "i">> He's busy cleaning his room and mowing today too. Been a productive day for him. My daughter regretted sticking a quarter in me: straight down the idiot's rabbithole.

Batteries for the detector.

The 4 Amigos gathered in the den with their machines. Surfing and bullshitting. Thinking about multiverse.plus again with my daughter. Her claim is that her characters themselves would only be on Twitter, Discord, and Tumblr because they don't know how to use computers. Fiction. Okay. Cool story. Like browsers, search engines, feed curators, trackers, distros, and processors, I think platform-hopping and cross-posting are crucial experiences. Consider mixing your mediums. Keep your major strips intact, and use the shareable, built-in comic dialogue tooling to rapidly flesh out what should not be drawn by hand to the same degree.
