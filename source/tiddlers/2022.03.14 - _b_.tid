"""
Chemistry tree with a volcano on top.
We have exhausted the possibilities of this. 
Alright, take it away. 

Nobody can hate pizza or clowns, ofc. 
I don't know if I'm going to keep it. 
Next. 
You're up. 

Illustrating Real Food As Vocation. 
Cooperation in all layers. 
Growing the crocodile. 
Everything makes sense now. 

Hourglasses. 
Kind of unhappy because I liked how abstract it all was. 
The Calendar thingy. 
Made it all worse. 

I thought you liked hotdogs. 
Sure, for dinner. 
A happy cyclops. 
No, thank you though. But, I'm happy to watch. 

I'm slightly less offended by what I just drew. 
It's on its own layer, so you can always delete it. 
Feel very much like. 
Okay, your turn. 

Gonna be amazed. 
The sheer genius. 
Impatient are we. 
I like the way you build patterns. 

I like the sudden surge of complexity.
Much less uniform, but I feel like we lost the core of the piece and the simplicity. 
It's kinda crazy now, all over the place. 

What are these purple dots all over the place? 
You can remove them. 
I'm gonna spice it up with these little dots. 
I guess it didn't work out. 

This one just looks like it's incorrect; 
I mistook it for lint on my screen.
Make it look correct. 
If it's incorrect...

I'm glad I didn't end with orange because you're like, running with it. 
You don't like orange?
I just don't think it would have fit the piece.

What is happening? 
An overlay where your name shows up. 
Did you say, hold on? 

It has mold on it now. 
That is so gross. 
It's very empty. 
Maybe we need a mondala there. 

We should start there. 
Or maybe not, it shouldn't exist, or what? 
Someone messed up the layer above. This is what we wanted. 
Work with what you have, you know? 

I feel that's too much purple, 
or maybe the right amount, you know? 
I'm very thirsty. 
My water bottle is empty too. 

[[Silence]].

Oh no I was expecting some great changes.
Maybe I should take a screenshot. 
I don't see any.

I brought some cookies and soda. 
I'm going to be monching on these.
Monch!

It's kinda a nice combination of colors.
It's better when it's...
What's better when?
I feel like its better when it is a e s t h e t i c. 

So you think this is done?
Maybe?
Where does it need more?
I feel like the blob is too much. 
Feels like it is unadorned. 

No, no, that was cool. 
Well, now I'm sad. 
There, now it's smaller and doesn't take up as much space.
Yeah, I think it's better, I think.
More balanced.

Your mic is not working this week. 
Maybe it's some distortion. 
Maybe his mic is better, because it's a desktop. 

I'm fine with whatever. 
Well, then let's start a new one. 
First we have to save it, well, yes, but then.
This has to be kept.

Okay, I have saved on my end.
Me too.
Okay, there you go.
I don't know why that's there.

Alright, you're up.
Hmmm. Mmmm.
Oh no, my pen died.
Let me know if my chewing noises are annoying.

You're on a layer below.
Even the shapes. 
Yeah, I get that.
I like that shape you've got going on.

That's a nice shape.
I kinda like the ratio...
This is too good.
I don't want to touch it.

We've reached perfection already.
I'm going to save it.
Right.
*[[Reconstruction]]*

I'll be right back. 
I have to change my headphones.
Alright.
Audeeze.

I think I'm back.
I think I'm done.
Very abstract.
Hehe.

I don't know how I feel about this red line.
It's a little different.
I like that we don't have any outlines in this one.
This is the hardest one yet.

Maybe we should remove.
Maybe that's the way forward.
We go back.

Wow. This is weird.
On the stream, I can see the thing I did, it's actually applied.
But, on my screen, it's not visible.
It's just so weird, but I can see this.

Ctrl+Zzzzzs

Alright, I leave this up to you.
Oh, no.
I did some very minor changes.
Mmmhmmm. 
But it's something.

AN INSANE AMOUNT OF DETAIL!
I don't know.
Bye.

Do you want to play the game you wanted to play?
I can't say that's gone away.
This is good. I don't know what to do to it more.
I mean, okay, then let's save it.

Did I stream it one other time?
I don't remember. 
Just like a short while. 
That game may have had some issues, but it was excellent.

What's this background?
Good question.
Oh, there's no option for that. Ah, interesting.

Holy shit,
That, uh, wow,
it's pretty interesting.
Dangerous thing.
unique;
test;
exit;

Looked like some concept art from a video game.
It could be concept art too.

Do they have fig newtons in hungary?
Why would that be funny?
I don't know.
You got questions.
Hehe.
Umm.
Pie, comes to mind.
That's some filling, and some stuff around it. 
Milk and granola.

I learned how to use AHK to pirate a map from the woods, the website.
Nice.
I feel like this is the most stable version of the script so far. 

I'm going to stitch all the images together.
I'm going to put it on the pirate tracker.
Somewhere that people can download it.
That's impressive.

Can I see the end result?
I don't think I wanna.
How could I get the 7gb image?
I probably wouldn't keep it.

Why exactly do you need this though?
I don't.
I'm just doing it because I want to.
Excuse me.

Nice work on the script, btw.
So, this is the script.
We can't see anything.
Apologies for subjecting it.
It's cool.
It's actually beautiful.
Merged.

I don't know what anyone will actually do with this file.
You can resize.
When I was back in the days of last week,
I assume it's a render.

A whole lot of desert isn't interesting or cool.
I'm impressed.
ImageMagick is amazing.
It's free, and open source.

I feel bad because I took your opportunity to do your mondala.
I distracted you from doing your mondala.
I wasn't doing anything specific.

And, I'm playing with mods, on PC.
It makes the experience a little nicer.
When it started, I didn't have the good graphics card in my computer.
The haptic was much better.
I will continue both playthroughs. 
I'm playing two different characters.
I guessed you've never been a Skyrim RPG player.
Fair.

Stay up.
I'll be there soon.
I love you.

Am I not streaming?
It says I'm streaming.
Okay. Now can you see it?
Okay, good.

Cyberpunk.
ASK joins.
I'm just going to eat my cookie quietly.
Use AutoHotKey on it.
<3
I would do amazing things to that man's junk.
Did you check out my link about Cyberpunk?
Last time I was watching you play...
I can read Light.

I guess it was the day after.
That is not grammatically correct.
Reading messages in a game.

What did that door do to you?
I'm trying to get in.
I'm trying to break the glass.
Seriously.

This game had more blood than Resident Evil ~~2~~ had.
Yeah.
What is happening here?
Is it like sudoku or something?

So, what's your objective here?
My objective was to pickup a box.
Which I did.
My primary objective is to loot everything, and to look good while I'm doing it.

I decided I want this car.
I like how whoever was in the driver's seat just disappeared.
That's a nice color.
It is. Wow.

Yup.
Yes. I think you would be an excellent teacher.
It is all or nothing.
A lot of people can't all.
