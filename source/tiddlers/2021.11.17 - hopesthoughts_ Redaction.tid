Dear [[hopesthoughts]],

It is not always a pleasure to [[wrestle]] with me. I understand. I appreciate your thoughtfulness. 

> Sure I'll bookmark that page, however I use the email notifications feature. This way I know when I have a message, so I can respond.

I wasn't aware that even chats (rather than PMs) were distributed this way. You'll find I'm quite reserved in how I generate notifications for others, especially as I'm in [[Reply Mode]] almost across the board (excepting my [[FTO]], [[BAGD]], [[Be A Good Husband]] duties).<<ref "ir">> It is usually only to begin the [[hyperconversation]]. 

> I'm going to ask that you take down anything that reveals my full complete legal name and location. 

Yes, ma'am. `/salute`. I've [[REDACTED]] the lion's share of the trail you've provided. To remove it all would require erasing your very name, [[hopesthoughts]]. We're in a difficult position because "[[hopesthoughts]]" was already (before we ever met) a tainted doorway to everything you've asked me to take down.<<ref "a">> Do you wish to eliminate the use of your name as it stands? Do you intend to burn your accounts and start from scratch? I [[hope]] not.

> Simply because if my family were to find it at some point, they'd be freaking out. My parents do not like the fact that I post online. They think it compromises their privacy somehow, and it probably does...Since my parents are afraid of having their privacy compromised by my internet antics, I try to post without using my legal name, last name, and location in most cases.

I deeply sympathize with you here, more than you understand at the moment. 

I think even we might be surprised how much information is leaked (and to whom) in not only speaking about our lives, thoughts, and feelings but even through unobvious and simple behaviors on our machines. You're correct that you directly and indirectly compromise their privacy, and I'm sure they do for both of you as well. I have lots of guesses about who they are, what they're like, and the relationship you have with them from even the fragments you have left us online.<<ref "i">> I think it's not only your justified political right to reveal that information, but even your moral one (and even obligation) in many cases. How about you?

If it makes you feel any better, I work to fly under the radar (though I recognize it conflicts with my vocation) or at least give people reason to [[pause]] before they would even publically speak about me.<<ref "m">> Despite my openness, I assume only a handful of people and glowies will read these words anytime soon.<<ref "ti">> There are many contradictions in our line of work, madame.

Do you consider your work mere antics? I don't. I respect your work (and, it's a shame that your parental units might not). Time and time again you have been a courageous woman who will say the unpopular thing because it's the right thing to do. I've seen it.

> I'm sure that you went on to find my address and all my personal information.

What you saw is what I chose to find at each stage. I held back, madame. Despite the fact that you are in a position to know how to maintain your own [[privacy]] and [[anonymity]] online (I respect your preaching, madame), I still consider you at-risk, especially given the nature of the topics you speak about. In stark contrast, people like [[JYU]] or [[Michael Kimsey Hudlow Jr.]] do not deserve it. While I think everyone merits the tools for generating some key types of privacy necessary for liquid democracy, I think few in the first world have a moral right to hiding much of this information given how much [[power]] they wield over the rest of The World and its future. How about you?

> I agreed to do the interview back in 2009, because I thought it would help the place I was interning with at the time. I had no other reason for doing that. I've been in the paper and on TV multiple times before that. Every time I received a piece of equipment when I was a kid, my teacher called the local press. As you saw I didn't publish that because it was going to deanonymize me, and then you went ahead and did it anyway without asking me. 

Deanonymization comes in [[dok]], as I've pointed out above, and bitrot has only helped us both a bit.<<ref "9">> My prediction is that it won't save us here. It is a postmodern cryptological social problematic that we are caught in a maelstrom of splintering and atomizing our identities across means of production we do not own. I've [[met|Instrume]] [[plenty|azl]] [[who|search_social]] maintain many shells and multiple-accounts. It is all too easy to cover up our failures to engage in discourse in [[good]] [[faith]]. Here I must commend you again: you've had a lot of integrity in your [[PSM]]ing, madame.

So, why should I have to ask you, madame?

> I'm also going to ask that you keep private messages and emails private. If you can't do this then we can't have further exchange. If you want to draft your responses to me in public that's fine, however I ask that you keep my side of the conversation just between you and I.+

This may be problematic for several reasons, including that even my responses to you will often contain the very text or information you've asked me to keep private. [[Privacy]] with me against everyone is earned. Note that you can [[contact]] me from a new identity, and you can control the flow information completely.<<ref "t">> Lastly, I will point out that you've yet to send a message through an actual privacy respecting messaging tool with me; our enemies can access the information with little effort as it stands.

I realize you may not wish to speak any further with me. If so, I wish you the best of [[luck]] on your mission.<<ref "y">> `/bow`.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
