title: 2021.09.02 - Antipleonasm Analysis: The Ineffable Word

!! Respond to [[the following|Why Not A Wide Area Network, Watson?]]:

<<<
The more we try to live in the world of words, the more we feel isolated and alone, the more all the joy and liveliness of things is exchanged for mere certainty and security. On the other hand, the more we are forced to admit that we actually live in the real world, the more we feel ignorant, uncertain, and insecure about everything.
<<<

Maybe you aren't careful enough with your words;<<ref "i">> I continue to find that to be the case, [[WINTCIS]]. Obviously, I feel abnormal (dare I say: deviant?) joy and liveliness in standard words,<<ref "b">> though you may call it non-trivially pathological. I also regularly observe and communicate information about the real^^tm^^ world, my ignorance, my uncertainty, and my insecurities in part to defeat my isolation. I'm glad I do, and I wish I had done it more from the beginning. I also think my [[hope]] is more fitting than most because I pay the costs to try to understand. You go ahead and call me the WEIRD schizo exception though because I think I still have you by the tail here. 

I think you're in more trouble than you do, as the sensations of your [[phenomenology]] themselves may be symbols and words of a kind.<<ref "h">> That we do not absolutely and completely access the thing-in-itself implies representation as a symbol, an impression, an abstraction, a compression, a proxy, and a vessel. If you mean to argue that there is a worthy realism to some paths of pursuing these signs or symbols, that it isn't merely an illusion or chaos of random artifacts, that we must take leaps of [[faith]], that we do in fact sometimes sufficiently access the thing-in-itself for it to mean anything, but that many symbolic pursuits are mere simulations by comparison (or that some lived experiences are simply not as worthy as others), then fine: you'd be right about that (and perhaps contradicting yourself).

I don't claim that drowning ourselves exclusively in standard words is sufficient, but that wasn't your claim either. I readily admit the existential (let alone prudential) value of [[silence]], stillness, minimizing language use, and just "being there," but that does not preclude the increasing pursuit of standard words. I agree that we can try to live in a world of standard words [[irwrongfrr]],<<ref "m">> but that's not the generalization you're making. I will openly argue that the pursuit of certainty and security are common problems and sources of anxiety that aren't always unjustified,<<ref "a">> but it's not clear the manner in which this is correlated with living in worlds of standard words. 

The wisest people I've ever met lived much of their lives in worlds of standard words.<<ref "1">> Flourishing people pour themselves into the study and experience of symbols. Sometimes they feel isolated and alone because of it (and this is also a necessary experience for wisdom and flourishing), especially as there weren't always many who could understand what they were experiencing, but not obviously moreso than others in the long run (and even if so, it still may be justified). No, from what I can see, being well-read and well-traveled, in some sense, is exactly what enabled them to maximize realism and their genuine connection with [[The Other]] so thoroughly and price-efficiently; it's part of what [[ltf]] to key sources of joy and liveliness that could not be experienced any other way. They also were able to empathize with real and fictional persons in radical ways, and they understood the depth of the problem of the ineffable with enrichment (much like you I think you seem to know). Those who critically and [[salient]]ly read also tend to have some serious epistemic humility and are willing to freely admit their failures and lack of confidence, often well before anyone else.

I consider your claim borderline hypocritical. I understand why you are disillusioned with your own words,<<ref "ai">> but you've thrown the baby out with the bathwater here. You've [[arrogant]]ly disposed of our language use as being fundamental to the type of creatures we are. And, as usual, you fail to pick out why we are here.
