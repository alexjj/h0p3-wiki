title: 2020.07.15 - Wiki Review: Voluminous

* [[2020.07.11 - chameleon: Root]]
** This is something I want an extension for...prepend it, and maybe crawlers over .tids to format. 
*** Maybe the buffer is the only thing I really need and then handle it from below (been a long time, and I never want to write javascript again, ever).
* [[2020.07.05 - chameleon: I Love You]]
** I'm bad about saying "I Love You." I remember so easily to do it in person or on the phone or at the end of a letter, but too often, in my everydayness, I forget. 
* [[2020.06.28 - chameleon: Night Owl Lyfe]]
** I'm stuck like that right now, lawd. #JustDepressionLyfeThings, for me at least.
** My hypothesis on why we aren't on more lists and red carpets boils down to: 
**# TW is ugly and sometimes unintuitive (and even extra unintuitive after personalization in some cases)
**# We're weird and not useful enough to those interested in that space.
**# It's expensive to duplicate (or better yet, reimagine) what we do.
**# These works generally don't have mass appeal anyway.
* [[2020.06.20 - chameleon: Evolving Tempo]]
** Her deck appeared to evolve more in thinking about tempo.
** I'm no fun: I'm trying to avoid almost all games (slipping here and there).
* [[2020.06.16 - chameleon: Categorization Porn]]
** Reminds me of namespacing.
** I think she would enjoy Everquest. She likes the retro, old school, and there will never be another game quite like EQ. Even the LoL professionals don't play as much as even the top 20% EQ players did.
* [[2020.06.14 - chameleon: Izzet Win]]
** Astral Slide was a bitchin' awesome deck, even standing up to Affinity and Goblins in Standard! 
** Not many people agreed with me that it was worth thinking about. In addition to many things she's said on her wiki, this makes me think they are going to do just fine no matter what happens.
*** I also think you have to be resource hacker to reasonably appreciate Forth.
* [[2020.06.04 - chameleon: Rain Margaritas, Spice, & Games]]
** I haven't had Mexican food in forever. That sounds really good right now.
** We ended up buying that bundle. 
* [[2020.06.01 - chameleon: Computer Touchers]]
** I simply have no idea what maximizes the odds are her landing a cush and cool computer touching job. 
*** I think we would have fun imagining how to play hooky on the job well. 
* [[2020.05.29 - chameleon: Advanced D&D 3rd Ed.]]
** Sadly, I asked again later, and that TW never came about. Seems like it would have been dope.
*** I wonder what `.md`-based TWX would look like. Probably needs to move toward maximizing interoperability.
* [[2020.05.24 - chameleon: Real Soon Now™️]]
** This came up for me again today: I don't keep food recipes. I should. I don't make anything super fancy though, but I should, right? Maybe. Instant pot recipification seems like the way to go for us.
* [[2020.05.21 - chameleon: Banging Cute Alien Girls]]
** Sucks that she may have to wait quite a while to see her dad. =/. I bet he'll like the gameshop.
* [[2020.05.11 - chameleon: Dungeoneer]]
** Haven't VCed in forever.
*** Hell, I've not plugged my mic back in since...I don't remember.
* [[2020.05.07 - chameleon: Heavy Storms]]
** Reminds me of my wife. Sometimes, reducing herself to reading by a small light is exactly what she needs and wants.
*** Both read way more books than I do.
* [[PT: Hofstadter]]
** [[IHN2S]]
* [[2020.05.02 - chameleon: Forth]]
** Seems like such an interesting place to explore with TW too.
** Sadly, it seems she's got another window of time in which she's homebound. 
*** Once she has her own car, I could totally see her hitting every con and cool thing in 500 miles. 
* [[ASCII: chameleon]]
** Definitely needed to gussy it up. I like the look more now. It's cleaner on my screen.
* [[2020.07.05 - Ovy: 易經]]
** I am honored to get to know many people who commit themselves that far.
* [[2020.06.19 - GClark: Rule-Following Problem Rule]]
** I tried to help him out as best I could. I'm not so convinced he's interested in where I'm most useful to him, understandably. 
** I'd adore seeing his wiki. I think it would be ultra-unique. Maybe he is decoupling and white-paperifying his writing process (perhaps commodifying it too?), but I'd like to see both ends.
** He appreciate how he is willing to have asynchronous, long-term conversations. I like that open bug-feature in our code.
* [[2020.06.11 - GClark: Cognitive Atomization]]
** It is always my honor to watch someone so competent wrestle with what is almost absurd or insane to so many people. He's hard to predict in some respects.
* [[2020.06.29 - Magnus: First Place]]
** Cube is constructed for people like me who just don't love drafting from a tiny cardpool (the interactions are boring to me). I can tell he likes eternal magic.
* [[2020.06.23 - Magnus: FNM is Back]]
** They've been kickin' ass at their local shop. Sounds like it's difficult for him to find the kinds of players that suit him the most.
* [[2020.06.01 - Magnus: Burnt Out]]
** He's a quiet man with me. I could totally see sitting down at our dinner table slinging cards and bullshitting, lol.
*** Hopefully, he would be down for getting drunk while we play magic. Would be dope.
* [[2020.05.14 - Magnus: Imbalanced Lurrus]]
** I am surprised. Lost even. He's got his own way of enjoying [[MTG]], and I appreciate that.
* [[2020.06.19 - BCS: Insanely Busy]]
** I am surprised that he doesn't move toward a TW-like structure. His sidegig consideration too.
* [[2020.05.15 - BCS: Agentcentricity]]
** The seed pitch. He did listen to some degree. I appreciate that. 
* [[2020.07.14 - TDL: Practice My Chavhood]]
** Leftovers were eaten. We still had a nice dinner though. It kind of came about accidentally. We were going to scrounge, but I started making stuff and just continued.
* [[2020.07.14 - Wiki Review: If One Feels Compelled To Say The System Worked, Then It Didn't]]
** I do not predict TWs will become common though. Considering how long it has been around, it seems safer to assume it won't. Only a small chance. 
* [[2020.07.14 - Prompted Introspection: Composing Music]]
** Completed. That is a light question, and I've given too conservative an answer. I hope I run with it in the future instead.
* [[2020.07.14 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: The global economy is a Ponzi scheme requiring a constant stream of new participants to prop it up.]]
** We're not getting back on the horse as I'd like. Fine, we lose ground. They got some things going for 'em. 
* [[PT: Dennett]]
** [[IHN2S]]
* [[2020.07.14 - h0p3ful Review: Missing Tiddlers]]
** I misunderstand my daughter more and more these days. That must be exceptionally annoying for her. I'm not sure what to do about it. Doubt myself more, at the very least.
* [[2020.07.14 - h0p3ful Review: Symbols]]
** My son may understand my daughter better than I do eventually. That is an odd thought. 
*** It's pretty obvious my brothers and I understand each other better too, as a parallel.
*** I have no idea what the relationship should look like later.
* [[2020.07.10 - T-Money: Schopenhauer's Muse]]
** Beyond the concreteness of our experiences together, Prayer for Owen Meany, and addiction: our recognition of the hedonic treadmills in our lives is something we both appreciate together. 
* [[2020.07.04 - T-Money: Shallow/Simple Conflation]]
** We have a difference of opinion about simplicity and normativity. I'm glad to hear he's trying to build with his family, that he's not given up.
* [[2020.06.24 - T-Money: Feeling Institutionalized]]
** I'm hoping he'll find his self-worth, in part, by more fully discovering the pricelessness of [[others]].
* [[2020.06.20 - T-Money: Serious Conversations]]
** Don't think he's really interested in my conversations, but I will do my best to explain.
* [[2020.06.15 - T-Money: Making Shelter]]
** Thinking about [[urban-survival.tdl]] with him has helped me understand what he takes himself to be doing on his farm and why he does want the world to burn. 
* [[2020.06.10 - T-Money: The Next Move]]
** Of course, there are similarities in our marriages. I don't know what to do for him on some of the differences. I think he'd have a really hard time finding anyone else like his wife, and I think he's gotta try to throw everything he has at connecting with this his family.
*** The reasons he has given have been obvious contradictions. She would float him, and she says she wants him to be happy. He doesn't need the money: he wants it more than fixing the problem.
**** I'd keep my job in his shoes.
* [[2020.06.07 - T-Money: keep pushing and striving and moving forward]]
** Man, I hope the next year will clear up for him. He desires for his co-workers to respect him in a particular way, and it's possible they will. He also has to make the transition to spending so much time with his family and being on-call (which further eliminates his ability to escape). And, again, the absurdity of the world's crisis amplifies this. His egoism leads to a special loneliness.
* [[2020.05.31 - T-Money: Pacing & Sobriety]]
** It's often interesting to think about why people repeat themselves.
** The convenient once-saved-always-saved delusion.
* [[2020.05.29 - T-Money: 3%]]
** I adore that he actually fixes the material around him. He's well-rounded, capable of specializing far enough wherever he goes (though it can be painful).
** Terrible argumentation, as he saw over the phone.
* [[2020.05.25 - T-Money: Kratom]]
** Aye. His neural pathways may never recover. It's a different kind of existential triage at that point. I can appreciate sedation in his shoes.
* [[2020.05.16 - T-Money: Titties are good commonground]]
** Sometimes I think he seek distractions while he is with his family. I know that feeling. 
*** 2020 has been a crazy fucking year for everyone. I despise that it might relax again. =/.
** Interesting to see his thoughts about his social circles.
* [[2020.05.03 - T-Money: Fuck you, <3]]
** The man is rarely sober.
** The reaction, of course, is standard. 
** I better understand why he prefers making killing machines instead now. Lawd, I am expensive to speak with.
* [[2020.06.20 - Tasha: Before The Move]]
** I [[hope]] they were able to find some peace. It sucks that they know they have neighbors who despise them. It's very expensive for them to reason wisely about.
* [[2020.06.06 - Tasha: Mom Staying]]
** I take it that it wasn't smooth. Seemed pretty difficult the last time.
* [[2020.05.26 - Tasha: May]]
** I'm always surprised we never got high together. I've know we've spoken to each other while high. I suppose it might be a different thing though.
