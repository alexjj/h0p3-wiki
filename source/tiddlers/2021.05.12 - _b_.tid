I recognize there are a number of problematics to calculating inflation. We're meant to think that the real lever of inflation control is in convincing everyone that it will be lower in the hopes of creating a self-fulfilling prophecy that would eventually allow central bank tightening. Managing expectations is propaganda, and I don't think the wealthiest buy it (so why should we?). Those in power in the US have profound incentives to underreport inflation to pay less interest on debts and pull the rug out from underneath the proletariat (wages have never followed productivity in my lifetime). The fact is that markets are still awash in cheap money, with perhaps more waves crashing. I will agree that supply chains are still disrupted. While I hope we'll see downward pressure on prices as production processes come online, I don't see why that will make up the difference.

Seeking less information in a context doesn't necessarily make for less accurate judgments. The virtuous perception filters out what is not relevant enough. What is salient is an abstraction, a compression, or a fitting subset of the total information available. Good predictions will model the whole, but may eventually focus, seeking less information in a sense. As is to be predicted on Bayesianism, the more knowledgeable and experienced a person is, the more likely they are to maintain their priors and the less weight they attach to discordant signals. Of course, it runs the danger of lodging us into quasi-dogmatic blackholes that can be wrong (though aimlessly wandering the fluid isn't obviously better). Justified absolute certainty can probably almost never be achieved.

Celebrate your weirdness. Dream without a schedule first. Avoid the disguised tyranny of the urgent, and take the longcut. Work on that which nobody knows how to name. The transformation of processing is often just as valuable as the [[FO]] end achieved by the process. May your passion suit you and your purpose exceed you.

Contingent unintelligibility of communication need not evaporate facts or issue license to merely construct one's own world.

I'm a demotivational speaker. I don't turn people on: I turn them off. Autistic superpowers, unless I'm speaking with someone already on the spectrum, imho.
