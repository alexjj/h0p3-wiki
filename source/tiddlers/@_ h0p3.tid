//That line got me. Dank mayocidal lolcow maymays just fo' moi? Oh you, you shouldn't have! It's exactly what I always wanted. I know it will help me escape from my crippling depression. And, yes, I'll be so careful: I'll make sure not to cut myself. Harming oneself is haram. Womp womp.//

“Glaciers, Gender & Science, a Feminist Glaciology Framework for Global Environmental Change Research” --- “Glaciers are key icons of climate change and global environmental change. However, the relationships among gender, science, & glaciers, particularly related to epistemological questions about the production of glaciological knowledge remain understudied. This paper thus proposes a feminist glaciology framework with four key components: 1. knowledge producers 2. gendered science & knowledge 3. systems of scientific domination & 4. alternative representations of glaciers merging feminist post-colonial science studies & feminist political ecology, the feminist glaciology framework generates robust analysis of gender, power, & epistemiologies in dynamic social ecological systems, thereby leading to more just & equitable science & human / ice interactions.

Daddy, what did you do during the erosion of our democracy? ... I shared some white-hot memes with a small group of likeminded friends.
