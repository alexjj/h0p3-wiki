title: 2021.04.04 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Familia

Late into the night thinking about [[nkbghost]]. Interesting part of how I do it is that any person can puppet as many puppets as they need. Paranoid me, always, looking for them {{Text Art: ùï±ùï¥ùïΩùï∞üî•}}spittin fools. I didn't give a heads up, but I'm fully monitorable. Someone took it to heart, ironically. Anonymous to me but not the capitalists from the looks of it. All lower case with good syntax. [[TTTOTW]].

Fireman Time! Then I took two massive dumps. I think it must have been the donuts. Went to bed at 8, woke at 1, bro vaping quietly in the corner, a gentle blur. He doesn't mind my farts. Rumination, couldn't sleep again, my daughter doing her indoor jumping/prancing/dancing routine in her room as she does, cute AF. 

A vision came downstairs. She wore a new fuzzy anniversary blanket and a piece of lingerie I've not seen in a long time (also left as a present for me). Literally Inform the Men! //Skintime// and then I proved that I could tickle her (because she said it couldn't be done, impervious in the moment). My favorite part of my bed is that once you're in it, it's hard to escape its clutches. Makes wrestling way more fun, and it feels like hugs from all directions (the autist's dream).

Shower of the gods!<<ref "d">> Windows open, so our neighbors have a chance to hear what I say in the shower (probably will get me put on some list somewhere ;P). Replaced curtains.

Meet cancelled. Already found a buyer. =/.

[[Family Time]] was solid. No [[TTP]]s, no weekly summaries, just reading and talking. My wife continues to let go. It's hard to do. Glad to see my son was pleased with his effort, able to control his computing habits and socialize. My daughter has been photoshopping like a miscreant. [[Scout]] made a delicious meal: salad, a mix of fruit/berries, quinoa/brown rice, and salmon. Been a while since we had fresh fruit and veggies, and it great. We chilled at the table, then we went on a walk for 1-on-1s. I'm glad we went. Hit the spot.

Finished off reading my wiki. Lots of comments, groans, and laughs today. [[Family Log]] was short and sweet.

Piranesi sent to [[DeathOfRobinhood]], just in case he'd want it.

Local-[[FTO]] continues poorly, but this is to be predicted. 1 in 100 is probably asking too much. Gonna keep trying. 

Cleaning and organizing. Room kinda looks decent even if somewhat barren (not complaining).
