title: Hereditary

* [[Sharp Objects]] and...
* Reifying the horror
* Ugly Pathetic Fallacy (I don't know the term)
* Writing's on the wall
* 1st Person Car Perspective
* DID, Schizo, NPD/BPD
* Generational Curses, of course, both genetic and memetic into spiritual dimensionality. 
** Evils of the Ages
* I promise we won't judge
* Eerie dollhouse microcosm replication modeling
** Voodoo doll representations
** THe exhausting details of perfection
* [[Charlie]]
* Tongue clicking, a tick tock sound of disapproval.
* A spiritual resurrection/haunting
* Not to everyone, I don't know anyone. It's hard to breathe. 
** Thrown into mature situations.
* Creepy projected-karmic mirror decapitation
** Unbelievable trauma, cannot even bring themselves to tell themselves the story
* Wailing: I just want to die. Oh, God. It hurts too much. I just need to die!
* Dazed Dissociative Blur and Absolute Anxiety
** So Absolutely Alone It's Not Clear There Is A Self
* Are you doing better, after your Mother? 
** It makes it less lonely. Embarrass yourself away, good lady.
* Accountability, honesty, and making lemonade. 
* Conjuring the dead...
* Sleep walking/delusions. Fucked up insect scene.
** "I never wanted to be your mother." 
*** Fucked up nightmares. Incepts/nests, and, of course, now I can't trust any portion of what I see not to be a dream.
** Medium delusion. You know what, had I lost my daughter, I wouldn't be sane either (not that I'm sane in any case). Unfathomable. 
*** I can't watch the death of children. It's so awful, I can't breathe.
** Possession. 
*** Woman doesn't seem to have aged?
* Magic tearing apart the family. Ruining lives.
** A lot of families are torn apart by the tragedy of losing a child. Pure dread in this film for me.
* A problem of trust.
* Get out of what?
* Nothing makes sense. Mental illness and magic do not make a fun combo.
* Headbanging on the ceiling is horrifying.
* I do not understand the worship scene.
** Music is going for broke amazing though.
* Alrighty then. Hail Paimon. I am lost.
