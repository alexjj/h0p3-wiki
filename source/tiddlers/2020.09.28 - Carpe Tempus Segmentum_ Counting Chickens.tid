title: 2020.09.28 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Counting Chickens

Ugh. No, I have no idea what I want to write up here. Maybe this is a mistake. I feel like I've settled into a kind of routine though. It's a relatively pleasant one too. I'm surrounded by the people I like and love. I get shit done, but it's crazy to most people's eyes. That's a shame. 

* AFireman Time!
* Read
* LoL+Chips+Salsa
* Sleep by ??
* Woke at 11:30
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Read+Write
* Walk With Offspring
** Lots of stress on the walk. =/. It was clear their mother had stopped in, but I'm the griller.
** Animated conversations though. Worth. 
** Howard & Ellen trailed behind us most of the way until our clan went too slow.
*** Ellen wanted out asap, lol (I am an absolute freak, of course). Howard smoothed it for her, again (spouse knows that game, sir). A fun remark about "better to be a prophet than a patriarch" to my son. The man reads.
** My son's a troll, but I will not be outdone. We had a conversation about the best sorts of ass slaps (no idea how we got there). I offered not to answer, but he kept pressing, lol. Fine. It's the double-hip-cheek cowgirl slap-grab-thrust. It's no contest.
*** I will continue to describe why fat (in the right places) is evolutionarily appealing. My favorite part is most OBGYNs will have their hands inside her (I'm living dream while this is happening) and look her in the eyes and tell her gleefully that she has child-bearing hips. Yeah, she do.
* Read
** I'm just fucking drowning. I have no idea how anyone else is able to do this.
* //The Walk//
** Gets to work from home tomorrow. Just meetings. 
** So, realtor demonstrates several layers of incompetence (it was scary watching this woman attempt to add numbers together). Fiddy is not off the market. Maybe she's tired? 
** Talked about the home. I'm happy either way. It's a huge risk either way, and I think whatever would bring us down would likely be the kinds of events that bring everyone down. Her arguments were not rational enough, but her gut matters (the decision is stupidly huge). It's up to her. She's the one that has to feel right about it.  
*** Commute time is not as good as we'd like, especially back.
*** There's work to be done, but no major work to make it liveable. Maybe the inspector will say otherwise, but I would be surprised (though, I don't know shit).
*** There's room to grow (literally ;P). It lacks privacy, and it's suburbed to the max.
**** It is far more than we need.  
*** Not including repairs, but including everything else I can see, it will be cheaper than renting.
**** It's in really good shape compared to all the other houses we saw in the price range (and this was the second cheapest). To a filthy fool like me, it actually feels too nice.
***** I also think it's buildable for every person in a just world.
*** I predict housing prices will drop some, but I also predict that capitalists will have very few vehicles to safely hide their wealth and put the money they are borrowing from future generations. If it accelerates faster, there are no safe places for proles.
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Went poorly after discovery. No game, sadly. 
** Mostly the adults talking about non-sense.
** Ribs, wedges, veggies
* Minor //Skintime//
** Please stay on top of me forever. Wish there was a better way for her to just read comfortably.
* Paperwork and making a bid.
** The most expensive personal live button click I've ever seen in my life, maybe. Signing it away.
*** Though, I've clicked one button monetarily worth more, but it was winning the lottery instead.
** If it went through, maybe Dec 2nd. I've never had so much time to move before. We might actually stop school (though, not the wikis...not that they'll do that anyway) to get it as right as we can up front. Counting chickens, ofc.

I thought we were going to take a break from thinking about houses. It's a nice surprise.
