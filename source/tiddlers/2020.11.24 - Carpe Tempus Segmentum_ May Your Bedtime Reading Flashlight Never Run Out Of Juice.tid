title: 2020.11.24 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: May Your Bedtime Reading Flashlight Never Run Out Of Juice

My [[monster]]s were barely touched today, but I did stare at a screen plenty. [[m10]] fed me a steady stream of content, melting my zombie brain.

* Read+Write+Walk+Talk
* Tried sleeping without my usual noise...
** Couldn't sleep.
* Tried sleeping with my usual, offspring kept me up...
** Couldn't sleep.
* Tried sleeping where nobody was...
** Couldn't sleep.
*** Or, if I did, it was half-brained and fragmented. Doesn't feel like I left consciousness.
* Cool story, bro. IDGAF. I'm doing nothing today.
* //Skintime// and snuggles
* //Godfather of Harlem// binge
* Assisted Fireman Time!
* //Godfather of Harlem// binge
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Pizza, tendies, salad
* //The Queen's Gambit// binge
* Nap in lap...

I don't remember much of the day, but it was a good one. Chill. The adults spent time together, and the offspring seemed to wander. They had to run out to get food (need gravy for thanksgiving).
