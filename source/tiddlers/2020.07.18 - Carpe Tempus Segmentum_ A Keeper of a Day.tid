title: 2020.07.18 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: A Keeper of a Day

* Woke at 10:30
** I needed more, but I had to piss so badly I couldn't sleep through it. Once I'm up, I'm sometimes just up.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Read+Write+Walk+Talk
* Cleaning
* Dialectures
** My son continues to fail to try. We're going to get there.
** They are both driving me fucking crazy.
* Called [[AIR]]
* Chats
* Vapelyfe
* Fireman Time!
* [[FTO]] work. 
** Crazy person talking, as usual.
** I am surprised to be speaking to some of these folks about these topics.
* Datewalk
** My wife waffled on whether or not she wanted to go. I asked her not to worry about it, veggout. She performed the experiment for me, and it turned her into a zombie. We've seen this before. She decided that she really missed going last week, and she felt it was a mistake. So we went.
*** By the end of the date, she was glad we went. She seemed more like herself.
** Lawnmower noise was too much for her, so she led us.
** Lost in thought and hands together.
** Hit the W-Entity for a possible shirt and Flonase.
** Hit Burlington for shirts (even cheaper). I now have something dress-casual. She got two blouses.
** Pokemotos
*** Customers were above average in attractiveness (excepting us).
** We rounded out our worlds. 
* [[Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση]]: My son wasn't ready.
** We had a dialecture about the state of our schooling. 
*** I'm glad we were able to express ourselves. Painful but worthy.
** I decided to take over for the evening. We moved onto Saint Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems. It's not the first time, but it clicked more effectively this iteration.
*** Didn't finish until 1:30. Took us 4 hours, but we have a much clearer picture now.
*** We had to brushup-rework-gloss-point to [[FO]] and [[SO]] logics, concepts of [proof, truth, and justification], definitions of functions, isomorphism, equivalency, modals, specifying interpretations, minimalist classic (and reasons we would prefer it), infinite and continuum, and the halting problem.
*** Discussion of Hilbert, modernism, Penrose, prime factorization, crypto, categories of foundationalism, relationship between syntax and semantics, representation and symbolic substitution, realism, implications for [[Phenomenology]] and our wikis. 
*** Hit his Ontological argument too. Tons of mapping.
*** I tangent and rabbithole everywhere. Definitely on fire today. Full animation, including farts. 
*** This is going to make our work toward [[Saint Hegel]] from [[Timelines: Philosophers]] easier to grasp. Dialetheia becomes clearer. 
*** My daughter continues to tentatively stab me with her tentpegs for shits and giggles the entire time: e.g. "You are nothing more than an ape pointing at the whiteboard uttering your pointless gibberish," "You're too much of a coward to NOT place your tentpegs." God damn, girl. Lol. 
**** I adore her ironic demonstration of the matter at hand. =)
**** That girl-woman knows how to make me squeal in glee like her mom.
**** I am glad that she sees the absurdity at so many levels. She's gonna need a sense of humor to handle it.
*** Spent time going after the Parmenidean matter and Scholasticism.
