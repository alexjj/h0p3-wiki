title: 2020.04.24 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Chill Friday

* Woke at 10:30
** Tossed and turned through the night. Back is feeling somewhat better though.
* Spooned!
** Dat ass. Yum.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* It was a day with some construction in it.
* Watercooler is no-go, atm. Can't find the fucking plates, lol.
** Still, daughter and I cleaned it out and got it ready.
* Son and I put together the crossbow
** It doesn't come with a great initial stringing tool, and that made life harder. 
** 175lbs, lol. I'm the only person in the house that can cock it (though we have a tool to help). 
*** God damn does it hit hard. Over an inch in solid wood (6x4s). 
* [[JRE]] called me!
** He's doing alright. Kickin' butt as a dad. Matthew has been chasing him around. =)
*** I get to hear bits and pieces of Matthew sometimes. It's cute.
** Louis C.K. directed a show that I might need to see.
** He told me about thinkin' about how rude I allow my offspring to be with me. He praised me for not letting my ego get in the way. I just don't care about some problems at all.
*** I do care about verifiable computing from them in some areas though. As he points out, it's the content that matters. 
** My brother referenced [[2020.04.20 - h0p3ful Review: 「(°ヘ°) - The Empty]], and found it an interesting tactic as well.
*** We considered rhetoric.
*** Talked about echo chambers, rabbitholes, alt-right pipelines, etc.
* Walk+Talked with myself
* Dialectures
* Walked with my wife
** Soaking her day in. So much to think about on her plate.
* [[vidyas]]: Sapolsky, finished another one. Noice.
* [[h0p3ful Review]]: delightful
* //Westworld// with my love
* Read+Write
* Walk+Talk with myself
* Sleep by 3
