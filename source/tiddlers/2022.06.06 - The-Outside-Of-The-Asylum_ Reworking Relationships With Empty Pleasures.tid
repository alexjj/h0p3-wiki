> "I could imagine swapping thumbdrives with particularly good audiobooks, music, documentaries, or movies wouldn't work as well. Codex is its own beast."

Yeah I don't do anything copyrightable. And TBH personally I'm trying to consume less visual media. Again, trying to re-work my relationship with empty pleasures.

> "How do you choose books for it?"

I have a "book bounty" which is a set amount someone is willing to pay for xyz copy of a book. I try (when it's possible) to never buy copies printed after Y2K, just because all of these "self" published books and new copies of public domain books you have now on amazon are made to be as cheap as possible. So people can sell their books if it's on bounty, I do a lot of buying from thrift books but you have to be careful, you can overpay on that website real fast. I also do some ebay here and there. But my mother has a estate sale business so a large portion of them are from those (books rarely sell). I do have childrens books and I give them away for free because i just have so many from those estate sales.

> "would you use a myanonamouse.net account?"

I don't really do torrents because my neighbors wifi is comcast and they've already sent him a email about torrenting. Thats why I ended up looking to soul seek, don't have to worry about tainted trackers. I could probably still download them now I have my VPN through my VPS set up. but it's only set up for ipv4 not ipv6 (which is a whole other beast) and it's not my internet. so trying to be nice. I've been thinking about buying one of those 4g hotspots, but I think having very limited access to the internet has been good for me.

> "How far did you go through the Boy Scout program?"

Proud eagle scout.

> "What's your truck like?

It's a typical VERY used food truck except instead of fryers I have books in crates on one side, and a electric kettle on the other, I usually do gong-fu brewing when it's not so hot. I love oolong.

> "Are you aiming for a tiny house or non-traditional construction to bootstrap from?"

So, it's kinda weird. Basically the way building code works here, as long as the structure is under 10x10x10 you don't need a permit, So my design plans are a pentagon of 9x9x9's with a small garden in the center, each one basically being a structurally separate room to a house. As in, one will be a bedroom, one a kitchen, etc. Once I get that done I'll put a few more in the back of the property for storage. I'm clearing space and saving up for a couple tons of gravel for foundation, then its concrete, then I have to figure out what I want to make it out of, Theres a lot of clay in the ground so I'm thinking a pine round/clay wall with pine roofing. But that's far away. The property is all pine trees pretty much, which isn't great, I'd prefer something harder, but atleast it'll be easy to shape and split for firewood, and if you are patient with cutting it you can let all the sap drain to the stump and have a great fire-starter.

> "did covid affect your business significantly?"

Before covid I was working as a head chef, and I was deep into my addictions, after covid i lost my job and got sober/professional medical help for my ailments. etc.etc. used what little i had saved to buy a property. and the truck kinda just fell in my lap. I had a old el camino that needed some serious love, and a friend traded me for it. He watched that chef movie about the foodtruck and kinda romanticized the idea of it, but when it came to reality it wasn't for him.
