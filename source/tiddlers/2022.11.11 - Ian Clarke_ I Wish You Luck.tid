"""
[5:12:00 AM] - [[Ian Clarke]]: Proposal for a network simulator, allowing us to track key performance metrics as part of our CI process: https://github.com/freenet/locutus/issues/377
[5:14:50 AM] - [[Ian Clarke]]: This will dramatically increase the likelihood that Locutus will work really well when first deployed. Debugging a deployed P2P network is a nightmare.
[7:58:56 PM] - [[h0p3]]: I could imagine a tool like http://imunes.net/ might be useful. It's nice to have a testing environment that is portable, easily reproduced, etc.
