title: Game Theory

//Preemptively beware those who conveniently slip into failing to distinguish between description and prescription. The war of all against all is a choice. The tyranny of evil is only almost inevitable, but it is not [[certain]]. Given what you have, where will you spend the resources of your identity, who will you be, and why?//

* Definitions
** the study of the ways in which interacting choices of economic agents produce outcomes with respect to the preferences (or utilities) of those agents.
** the attempt to pick out the most salient mathematical structures in material dialectics (regardless of agency) for the sake of some end. 
* the study of the logic that governs the interrelationships amongst incentives, strategic interactions and outcomes

* Motivating Examples
** Saint Plato's Battle of Delium, Cortez' shipburning, Shakespeare’s //Henry V//, Battle of Agincourt
** Hobbes
*** Distinction between tyranny and anarchy. 
**** When was it ever not both?

* Parametricity
** Acting on a passive world vs acting on a world anticipating
** The materialist's computational and informational advantage
** Concealing our patterns and predictability
** Acting on what they least suspect that they most suspect that they least suspect, etc. The reflective circular or [[infinigress]]ive problem.
*** The falling of the cooperation tower by turn, from top to bottom. Why [[T4T]] had such a special advantage. 
*** Poker, "leveling"
*** All the maps into even this part of [[The Infinite]] territory freeze our computers that must wait for some computers that never halt (a risk we cannot defeat). We are locked into this Catch-22 machine of indecision at some point. 
**** Intuitionist Theories of Constructions. Yet, we must take risks.
**** What is good enough or sufficient? Justification sufficiency.
