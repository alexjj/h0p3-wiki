How are the chickens?
Apr 27 12:32pm
They are getting so big! They need more room!
Apr 27 12:33pm
Awesome.

Yes. They are growing. We need to plant because some are too tall for the container.

Yes my beans are huge!

But you can take the plastic lid off and let them continue to grow too
Apr 27 4:46pm
So far, that is what we are doing. It's working. Hoping it won't affect the sprouting of the others too badly.
Apr 27 4:47pm
Still worried about how cold it gets.
