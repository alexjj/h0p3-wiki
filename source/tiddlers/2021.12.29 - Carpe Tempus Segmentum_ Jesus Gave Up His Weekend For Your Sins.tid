Massage + //Skintime// with [[ASK]] + //Kushiel's Dart// @C39:08:52. Sleep by 4?

Woke at 10:30. Meditation. [[TTTOTW]]. Assignments.

Mi amor and I went to get our oil changed, but that will have to wait. 

//The Date// with mi amor. We had fried chicken and soda water for me. It was dope. We were fairly quiet today.

Found my offspring grinding in [[The Den]] without intervention (other than the reminder earlier). They are both struggling to get their tools running. Solved my son's with him, and I want to see him replicate it. 600mbit through shadowsocks, 30-40% of a vcore during full load. 40ms, but I think the datacenter has better peering arrangements, as the average is often less in real use. Bad news: already flagged for using a proxy (took only a couple hours). =(. So much suspect about our traffic as it is. I think this counts as evidence that exits should be [[anonymized|Anonymous]] and that even the datacenter-based routes (at least the cheap options) are not what they used to be.

Dadnap. Exhausted, and I don't have a good reason for it. I slept really well. Kinda a chill day. Nap roulette as [[AA]] might say.

[[MTG]] before dindin. She doesn't like to take things back while we're learning the game. All about experiencing those consequences. I admire that in many respects. MWC vs Gobos. Barely edged both out.

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. I am frustrated with my penis. Lol. 

[[Family Gathering]]. We had ribs, wedges, and green beans. I had lots of water and a candy cane and dark chocolate too. We watched The Jerk kid episode of //House//. `/nod`. Vapelyfe.

[[TTTOTW]].

//The Walk// with [[ASK]], taking the double route. Met Chris(?), by one of the second route corners. 4th daughter OTW, new van just got stolen. Flashed us with high beams and talked with us. Didn't seem nearly as upset as I would have been. Exchanged names and address to put my skin in the game with him, ofc. Many rabbitholes. Vapelyfe
