Missing the cabin thing this week...maybe another year

Yo!
Dec 29, 2020 9:52pm
Holidays are going well. [[k0sh3k]] is getting a much needed break. We are piecing a house together. It is pleasant, not too rushed. Thinking about what I hope to do this year with it.
Dec 29, 2020 9:53pm
Dude, I miss the cabin.
Dec 29, 2020 9:53pm
That was amazing.
Dec 29, 2020 9:53pm
Sorry. =/
Dec 29, 2020 9:53pm

Dec 29, 2020 9:53pm

Dec 29, 2020 9:55pm
Seems like a lot might happen in the next month.
Dec 29, 2020 9:56pm

Wow. Killer.
Dec 29, 2020 9:59pm
Yeah Stephen bought it for her
Dec 29, 2020 9:59pm
That's awesome.
Dec 29, 2020 9:59pm
On the downside â€”we gotta work on ACT stuff â€”she is a horrible test taker
Dec 29, 2020 9:59pm
I hear that.
Dec 29, 2020 10:00pm
The car is perfect for her â€”tiny and cute
Dec 29, 2020 10:00pm
May it last her a decade.
Dec 29, 2020 10:01pm
Yes!
Dec 29, 2020 10:01pm

Dec 29, 2020 10:01pm
Toasted Marshmallow is the color
Dec 29, 2020 10:01pm
Its a weird mix of old tech and new tech...
Dec 29, 2020 10:02pm
I hope it will be easy to maintain.
Dec 29, 2020 10:02pm
Manual locks and windows but back up camera and apple car play
Dec 29, 2020 10:03pm
She still has to take her driving test so she is chauffeuring me everywhere
Dec 29, 2020 10:04pm
Hows [[j3d1h]] and [[1uxb0x]]?
Dec 29, 2020 10:04pm
Putting a house together. Setting up their rooms. Trying to remake habits and form new ones.
Dec 29, 2020 10:05pm
Prepping to head back to school, I hope.
Dec 29, 2020 10:05pm
Yeah ðŸ˜Š
