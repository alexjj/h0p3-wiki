title: 2020.08.22 - kyr0ss: DRAFT v1.1

//This is pure draft. Trying to [[T42T]] here. I'm also perfectly happy to work with what you've already sent me. I forgot to say: please take as much time as you wish! Writing is expensive, crazy expensive sometimes!//

* I am [[grateful]] that I have the chance to take my time to read your message, [[kyr0ss]]. It's a pleasure.
* I'm still interested in your name. I like the way it sounds, and I think there are lot of facets to what it may pick out as well. 
** I likely overemphasize the concern of [[naming]] in most cases. I [[hope]] you will forgive my obsessiveness about the problem.
* I would be delighted to see your public-facing wiki (or anything that you find representative). 
** I'm extremely fortunate to know my friends who risk living their lives in this absurd adventure of being online with each other: [[chameleon]], [[Sphygmus]], and [[kickscondor]]. I [[hope]] you will feel comfortable joining us; the more the merrier. 
** I hate to admit it, but I think that TW is not always so easy to use, and I'm (I suppose this is ironic) sad about its documentation. When I am angry or unhappy enough, I consider it a clusterfuck. But, I am also so glad that I have the chance to use it.
*** It's a tool that is probably above my paygrade, haha.
** Not that I know a ton about TW, but feel free to ask me questions. I'll see what I can do to answer them. I assure you that I am disappointing in this regard.
* Extroversion is a fascinating topic to me:
** [[2019.01.02 - L: Appears To Speak Through Me]], 
** [[2019.08.31 - Prompted Introspection: My Appearance]]
** [[h0p3's Psychometrics]]
** I would argue that it has increased the number of contexts in which I am extroverted, where I feel safely motivated to connect and find my time with others an energy gift.
*** Speaking with you is like that.
* ~~Btw, either you or someone posing as you connected to me on Tox. I'd like verification that it's you.~~
* Linux inside TW, perhaps SSHing into the underlying system? Poking holes and many other problems.
* BSD, were I a real dev who didn't want to write a unikernel in Rust or Forth
** The tome I read at 16. Never actually prepared me to use it after install.

This seems to have failed. You dropped off the mpa with me. I wish you the best of luck. I am still here. Tox is still the best way to acquire my immediate attention.
