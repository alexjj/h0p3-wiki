The ego is not Dasein (and, it is unclear if Dasein precedes the ego in [[phenomenology]], it may be a precondition to and category of some kind of [[phenomenology]] [and if Saint Hegel is correct, then all possible objects in all possible ontologies might be Daseinic in at least some cases, and therefore the will to power may be the dialectical war of all egos against all egos as an attempt to model the dialectics of all spinozan essences]). We cannot say that egos experience anything with certainty, though perhaps they do. Egos can be stable, but they don't have to be; they vary in [[dok]] of coherence and positivistic justification attempts. Egos can change, perhaps they do become wounded and heal up, and they seem quite viral in some respects. A living meme and memer. The ego rests upon (and perhaps even possesses its own) collection of beliefs about it or itself. It is possible that it feels pain when its beliefs are contradicted, but a particular disjunct must obtain that sits between the hard problem(s) of consciousness and the problem of other minds. It is a part of our [[4DID]], egos are not our identities. We are not in a position to speak about emergent features of collective agency to deny nested Bayesian types of consciousness (which need not be complete to be called such). I agree that the ego takes itself to be seeking only itself (though conceptually it can never complete or coherentify any justification for that goal), and I'll even agree that the purest instantiations of ego will tend to seek themselves almost absolutely. It is morally vicious to claim that in all cases we ought to grow past our pain by ignoring or denying or no longer identifying-with the causes of said pain. Sometimes self-conceptions ought to be remain intact, integrated in a particular way. There's part of a working metarationality.
