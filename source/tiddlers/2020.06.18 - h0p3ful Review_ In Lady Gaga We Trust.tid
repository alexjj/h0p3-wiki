*[[Notage Ti.48]]
** Perhaps heading back to Manjaro is the best option. You got your Archlinux set up decently enough, but I think it makes sense to take up the easier route until you know you prefer having to set it up to a further extent.
*[[Notage Ti.47]]
** I adore it. Thank you.
*[[Anaximander]]
** I think it makes sense to have a place to keep your notes. You worked hard on those notes. Have a place with you original writing, and then have the final product. Keep them both.
*[[The Lightning Thief: 16, notes]]
** These notes seem sparse compared to your others. Do you feel you've put in enough effort?
*[[2020.06.17 – Wiki Review: Better today, worse someday.]]
** You aren't enriching this. This doesn't feel much different from what you've done for years. I want you to push the envelope here.
*[[2020.06.17 – TDL: Oops]]
** What are you doing for [[Leet Drafting]]?
*** You are aiming to work on one thing for the week for now. Let's get one thing drafted and made right. 2.5 hours devoted to it.

** My guess is they made meth. You remember that house on the backstreet pathing to your mother's work? They burned a lot of trash, confederate flags, often looked strung out: there is a non-trivial chance they made meth. 
*[[2020.06.17 – Carpe Diem: Tired.]]
** I'm brimming with ideas. Most of them are stupid, I assume. =)
** I'm glad that melatonin is helping you.
*[[2020.06.17 – Antipleonasm Analysis: Trust]]
** I adore your argument. 
**  Lady Gaga, if I understand correctly, is famous for having some real depth to her, beyond the celebrity image she (and hordes of imagecrafters helping her) emits. 
*** This is a good line. I have [[hope]] that learned mistrust can be mended, though with some non-trivial memory costs associated in the [[Gradual]]ized [[T42T]]. 
**** This is me going on all soft on you, but I also respect the concept of [[Jubilee]] that celebrates that we can become different people, that we can repent, that retributive justice must have its limits in many cases. Forgiveness as forgetting is a mercy I do not understand well enough, and I [[hope]] to, sir. I hold your understanding of the ideality of [[The Golden Rule]] in the highest regard. You have said it like so few would know how.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** [[2018.06.18 -- Hyperreading]] looks like my [[Link Log]]s. I will suggest you have some degree of categorization, even if that is the only commentary. 
*** I know you don't do them right now. In the future, I suspect you will do something like it. There's no way to be effectively using the web without some kind of digested and associated archive.
