!! About:

//Art generates experience machines. How stimulating. Representing is doing. Maybe art is just another form of screaming.//

Great art points in the direction of [[the good]]...

Good artists borrow, great artists steal.

But while on the one hand we give this high position to art, it is on the other hand just as necessary to remember that neither in content nor in form is art the highest and absolute mode of bringing to our minds the true interests of the spirit. For precisely on account of its form, art is limited to a specific content. Only one sphere and stage of truth is capable of being represented in the element of art. In order to be a genuine content for art, such truth must in virtue of its own specific character be able to go forth into [the sphere of] sense and remain adequate to itself there.

-- Saint Hegel

 We all know art is not truth. Art is a lie to make us realize the truth.

While science follows the stream of reason & consequence, & with each attainment sees further, & never attains a satisfying goal, art is always [takes itself to be] at its goal[, which is why it is insufficient]. 

-- Schopenhauer

Now, if we assume that life is in itself an object of horror & terror & that pessimism, in the sense of the no-saying attitude to life, can be avoided only by the aesthetic transformation of reality, there are two ways of doing this. One is to draw an aesthetic veil over reality, creating an ideal world of form & beauty. This is the Apollonian way. And it found expression in the Olympic mythology, in the epic & plastic arts. The other possibility is that of triumphantly affirming & embracing existence in all its darkness & horror. This is the Dionysian attitude, & its typical art forms are tragedy & music.

-- Copleston, //A History of Philosophy//

The artist, like the rest of us, is torn by various desires competing within himself. But, unlike the rest of us, he makes each of those desires into an element for use in his art. Then he seeks to synthesise his elements all together to form a style. The sign of a successful synthesis is a unified & unique style plain for all to recognise. So it is that a successful style can seem to its audience full of indefinably familiar things - & at the same time invested with godlike power of 'understanding' that is far indeed from the daily round. The process by which a man has forged such a unity is [part of] the most profound & most exalted of human stories.

Perhaps it's good for one to suffer. Can an artist do anything if he's happy? Would he ever want to do anything? What is art, after all, but a protest against the horrible inclemency of life?

Artists must suffer for the art. That's why it's called painting.

What is art? I don't know. It's like asking what is //logos//? My best guess is the above definition (be they for real or hypothetical experiencers), but even that may be wrong. There are too many plausible definitions in our conceptual analysis. It's definitely a postmodern problem that even the ancients saw, and it seems connected to almost every field in philosophy. The answer isn't simply a moving target embedded in [[The Great Human Conversation]] itself; it defines the very nature of that conversation and beyond. What is essential to art-ness? The [[salience]] of [[Art]] is the most essential aspect of it. Rhetorical excellence in expression is no substitute for expressing what matters [[irwartfrr]].

Art can be communicative, representative, expressive, and demonstrate some minimal degree and kind of skill. Art seems instrumentally valuable and perhaps even intrinsically valuable. Art seems to have functional intent but is also subjectively interpretable. Art may be given status by a reflective equilibrium, but even individual subjectivity seems to impart value to art. Art seems to be extremely broad, and line-drawing definitions don't seem to do me much good. Aesthetic Beauty, Being, The Good, and The Right are all fundamental problematics intertwined in philosophy. All the exceptions to definitions of art cause me to draw relationships between these problematics. Art does seem contextualized like "The Good" and "The Right," wherein we must ask "Good for whom?" or "Right given what standard?," thus "Meaning for whom?" or "Art for whom?" are perfectly valid responses.

This is too broad a definition for most people to swallow, but I go where my line-drawing leads me. Artists, by my definition, include damn near everything: house-builders, geometers, painters, wrestlers, inventors, rule-followers, pattern-makers/finders/interpreters, language-users of any type, construction of any type, knowledge-work of any type, etc. Do non-Daseinic beings make art? It seems like it. Not only non-human animals make art, but nature itself. Evolution, agent or not, expresses art all the time to us. Evolution and Being itself may be art. That's how fucking far I'm willing to go here. I'm a skeptic who is willing to accept absurdly maximalist unification definitions of artists and art. Go for it: Art is life. I can't tell you that you're wrong.

I'm not sure what isn't art. Thus, forgive my errors of category, inconsistency, or presumed misuse and dilution of the term. There are legionic reasons for why this is the art I've chosen to catalogue. What I have here may not be your cup of tea (although, I tend to think it should be included in your consumption and digestion). To those who are willing and able, please enjoy the magnificently high signal-to-noise ratios of my art library; I know I do.

Ultimately, I'm trying to build collections of art for my children to consume and wrestle with. We need shared cultural objects, common languages and points of reference, and a variety of communication tools in order to effectively empathize with each other. Furthermore, I believe my curation practices will help them distinguish braincandy from brainfood, understand the telos of tuning their signal-to-noise ratios, and gives them a massive head-start in searching for meaning.
