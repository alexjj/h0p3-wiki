title: 2021.02.05 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Rawrgasms

* Try To Take Over The World
* More alert tooling to test.
* Laundry
* Clean & Organize w/podcast (doing my best here to learn 2 podcast once again).
* Fireman Time!
** My toys are breaking again. I'm feeling like I may actually accomplish one of my [[2021 Resolutions]]. I am in breeding mode.
* LoL
* Sleep by 5
* Woke at 10
** It was enough...
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Bro smashed our teefbrush holder, but I happen to have an extra one. Boom. 
* Shipment arrived. Bro is gonna stick to vaping because dosing the disty is so hard to do. 
* Bugged offspring
* [[MTG]] with son:
** His Affinity +1 vs Dredge; He has clamp ready, and I explode T2, swing with GGT while he's clampcycling chumpblockers, but whiffs at the end while I'm at 10 cards left. I corrected a few errors, but overall he knew what he was doing.
* Shopping @ W-Entity con mi hermano
** Shelves, caulking and gun, tile adhesive hook, cooking condiment squirt bottles, jolly ranchers for Δ⁸, a pie for my wife, toothbrushes, and whiteboard mounting hardware I was missing.
** Met a chemist in the hardware aisle. I opened my bag of hardware, smelled them, joked they were fresh, and he came out of no where laughing. He was a specialist in metal coating before retirement. Talked to me about zinc, CA labeling (incase, yanno, you ingested raw zinc), his son and grandson, etc. Boomer seemed bored.
* Called [[JRE]]
** Congratulated him on his marriage. Sounds like it was not terribly romantic to his eyes (but, he set out not to have it be that way). 
*** They are celebrating with Indian food. My ninja.
** Quinn is sleeping! Fuck yeah.
** He's singing more, hoping to play more music. 
* Setting up shelves with offspring. Gonna leave 'em blank for my brother to see if he needs them for food storage. 
** Think I'm going to line every wall with these. They are cheap, sturdy, and they should provide us years of storage. I could go for the metal, but I'm not convinced it's worth the extra cost (adjustability might be worth it though). 
* Caddy mounted in shower. 
* Hempirical Testing
** CBD feels somewhat like a benzo.
** Showing [[Product Review: Plenty]] to my bro, having him try it out as well.
