*** I've still not decided to maintain an archive. This is already ephemeral as it were; I've got links that disappear same day.
**** Clearly, the only way to do this is to record all inputs and outputs on muh [[monster]]s with timestamps and MLed tagging, then reference those in a stream flowing into an ocean. I'm in need of mirrors. Who wants to host?
