title: 2020.05.19 - Prompted Introspection: Madman

!! What's one of your favorite parts about being you?

I've modified the question from [[2018.11.14 - Prompted Introspection: 1 Non-Problem]] for the usual. [[Gratitude]] shows up in [[CTS]], but I think it's good to be explicitly required to answer it as well. Obviously, some of my favorite parts of myself have been double-edged swords. 

I think my boxy rigid autism, my rule-following demands, my process discipline somehow allows me to escape convention in many contexts. I'm a crazy person. I like my [[/b/]]ish craziness, even in cases where no one else does. I take things too far, and I like that outlandishness. I'm lucky to be able to "be myself" (whatever that means) in a lot of contexts. Sure, it has almost cost me my life several times, and it can be a curse. I think my ability to grind into the craziness is also one of the reasons I enjoy life. I'm a madman in the desert, and even if it is lonely, it is quite a journey.
