Hey sorry very busy day yesterday! How are you- we got new neighbors finally ðŸ¤¨ they seem chill just canâ€™t stand the new ones that moved I. To the left of your old unit ðŸ™„

Canâ€™t wait to move I wonâ€™t miss that place
May 9 9:10am
Your move is coming soon! =) That is exciting.

We're doing well. I need to get more sleep. Trying to figure out how we can take a staycation here.
May 9 12:32pm
What kinda of staycation -are you thinking!?
May 9 1:21pm
We are thinking of going on an all inclusive if this virus will let up!
May 9 1:22pm
Those are nice!
May 9 1:41pm
I don't know what we'd do for a staycation. I was thinking about prepping food for a week, using paper plates, and have no school work (with minimal wiki). I think we would just vegetate.
May 9 1:42pm
Vegging sounds so good.

How about yâ€™all
May 26 11:11am
How is everyone
May 26 11:11am
We're doing well. It's been productive. Pushing hard in school. [[k0sh3k]] will probably be back in the office in July.
May 26 12:10pm
A cyclist hit her on our walk, so she's recovering from that.
May 26 12:10pm
How about you all?
May 26 12:11pm
Iâ€™m sorry to hear about [[k0sh3k]]!? Is she okay- we are blessed more than ever! Going to start packing at the end of June. We already gave notice and all. Other than finding out my last employer got called child services on and Iâ€™m the supposed accuser! Like I have nothing better to do 6 months later
May 26 12:41pm
She's doing well. Has a limp for now. I think in a few weeks, she'll be new.
May 26 12:42pm
Glad to hear you are moving, and I appreciate that you will hold them accountable if required to do so.
