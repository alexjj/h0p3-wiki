title: 2022.07.13 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Fixin' A Faucet

Nearly finished another episode of //Westworld// spiraling into the toilet, except mudbutt got in the way. Sleep by 1?

Woke at 6:30. Mi amor didn't sleep well either. Morning is behind, so she's off balance. Meditation. Rumination. Gump. Call from the state for the inspection, moving it up a few hours. Second time a local number does not work (they can hear me, but not the other way around). Tried to sleep again, no go. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

Apologized to my daughter. She was fine with it. Also, spawned a discussion about her mathematics. An old one.

Eric and Nick came to do an inspection. Two vans. Before they got underway, I asked if their inspection would have any impact on low income assistance, as we should be eligible. He went up the chain of command (since he has worked that side of things before) and discovered that if he completed his inspection, it would prevent us from attempting to receive help. Gave up another place to contact as well. Called, left a message. Some of the paperwork has been filled out, but I'm missing some pieces.

Could not replace the cartridge on our faucet because I could only get passed the first piece of hardware, but the second was stripped. Took out the whole thing instead. Fuck it.

Shopping @ Home Depot with my sympaticon. Found a faucet for $35 that looked easy to clean. Bazinga. My sympaticon found a gorgeous schedule 40 iron pipe weapon that would crack skulls, but no can afford that shit. My homemade screwpipe flange tightener/loosener/aligner is a deadly steel bar onto which I've welded two thick shaved bolts with nuts, but she doesn't like the feel of it. 

Hit the house to grab docs. Went to CVS to get copies, no go. My sympaticon had two reasons to be there, so it was not wasted.

Went to a print shop, got copies of her birth certificate. 

Shopping @ W-Entity with sympaticon. Bought some bigshit supplies. Fohtee. Grabbed some vinegar and bleach, sugar saviors (having a hard time keeping it stable). Thank goodness it's summer.

My daughter checked the fluids on the SUV then went back to programming. Cleaning and taking apart the rest of the sink with my son. The bottom of the sink is not exactly standard, but we've got it sealed (`/fangers-crossed`).

[[JRE]] called me up. Second time today my phone has been acting up. [[Q]] can now escape his crib, and that is wreaking havoc. [[Rb]] lost her alternator yesterday, and there's just too much to be anxious about. Also, interview with her old boss next week, for sanity and escaping that neighborhood (gunshots in the backyard again). Recommended //Tunic// to us, and my offspring have pirated it (yus) and began their testing. He replaced the alternator in an hour and a half, and the feller who sold it to him said it be 6-8 hours. Not easy on his back, but he Amadeused that shizzle with a few taps on a bushing.

Hiccup. My son accidentally attached the top and bottom of the lift rod for the drain cover before it was inserted, and we could not undo it (tried several routes). Last one they had, can't return, and the old one was in poor shape. Fuck it, we'll keep the plug separate (tied a tiny length of rope on it for ya, Samwise) for the handful of times we actually want to fill it with water. I prefer the drain open. I cut the pivot rod after the seal to prevent anything from catching. Fuck it. Make it easy.

My sympaticon cut my hair. Shower.

Bathtub drain starting to clog. Lots of people with long hair who don't always clean it out after use. It's bound to happen. This augur is more ghetto looking, but it works better. 

Shopping @ Aldi with my sympaticon. Fruit, sausage, Cashier apparently knew us (but I don't think I've seen her*), asked where our giant cart of food was. Told her next week.

Mi amor, my sympaticon, and I chilled in the //The Commons//. Sboi interview and presentation went well. Mi amor got to give the tour. Think he's what we thought. Still worried about how to pack in the internships over the next 6 years. There's not a beautiful way to do it. I'm reminded of her MLIS here. We made it work, even though it was ugly AF sometimes.

//The Walk// with mi amor. Dranks and a well-priced spicy mango candy. Maria will be her [[PH]] until I get her name again, runs the sto, seems like a nice lady. GILF in two-piece who gets annoyed that we get lost in our own world together talked with us about her annual work of using silverware to clear the weeds out of the road. She didn't seem to think the best reason for doing so was to prevent erosion, but only to make it look nicer. Not as much work on her paper (which she is growing to hate) as she'd like. Played my clarinet. Walked through my day. Thinkin' about the world. Everywhere is gettin' hit. Rate of change on inflation up, and for the stag part, traditional Fed pivot point is already here. Mi amor increasingly worried about war with China. 

[[D2]] + //Ender's Shadow// @D11T03:02:49. Dudu geared back up sufficiently to hit 163FCR (really needs 89 for the 2/20 ammy to add +1 rings), and he's still unable to tank physical damage dealers as a melee range caster. Think I'll continue to wait. Ultimately, some classes really need to work in a group because their holes cannot be filled (so not y u m).

[[Family Gathering]] was delicious. We had baked pasta, and we watched more //Stranger Things// (I should never have agreed to this, `/smh`). [[TTTOTW]].
