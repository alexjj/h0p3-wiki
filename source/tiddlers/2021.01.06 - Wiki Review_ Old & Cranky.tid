** It can be difficult to determine when someone is actually being an asshole or working hard to mimic it hilariously as a rhetorical effect.
** Not convinced Rene Guenon is worth my time, sadly.

** More strictly limiting the scope of time with my family to the evening has been a different experience. Curl-up continues.

** I have designed my work with that place in mind, [[WINTCIS]]. 
** I don't know how to make well-functioning adults: look at me, lol.

** god damn degenerates. 
** My favorite sociology professor ruthlessly picked people out of class to talk about their masturbation habits in front of the class. He'd scream at you calling you a liar if you denied you partook, and it wasn't clear if we were supposed to laugh (but it was funny). I'm 90% sure he was actually engaged in research for paper. Hilarious mamajama. Such a weird affect (like, he was "in character" the whole time) and profoundly unconventional. This man's one comment on my final paper (regarding the death penalty) was "BRIEF", lmao. 
*** I wish I could spend an hour speaking with him now. I'd like to know his perspective. He might be dead; he was old and cranky when I met him.
