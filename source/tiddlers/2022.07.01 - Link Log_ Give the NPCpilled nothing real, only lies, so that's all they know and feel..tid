*** I think the wealthiest, on average, just don't have a problem with how inflation is generated (they are so wildly shielded and even direct benefactors of the process, one that continues to push the gini coefficient harder). Surely there's at least some lipservice at work here, especially given how the problem has been handled in the past couple decades (and in previous cycles). I'm not saying they won't raise it again, but I would be cautious to think they'd ever even attempt to go Volcker (I suggest that would freezeshock liquidity, sending that contradiction rippling through until it cracked and ripped it apart). Not only should we consider that rates won't be raised much more, they may lower them again much sooner than they claim (I see little reason to think they can strongly control inflation [beyond supply chain problems] without collapse - just have to keep the illusion up with enough of the population through whatever placebo, gambling and spectacular pontification opportunities [''''[[ITS]]], and false compromises they can inject). Haven't even called it a recession yet (though ATL Fed is calling the second quarter), and surely that narrative has to play out first unless it's something as drastic as domino amplification of derivatives (as with 2008 and arguably Covid).
**** Yet again echoes of the crisis of capitalism, in which excesses of both money without opportunities for profitable investment and  reserve armies of surplus workers without jobs lead to a devaluation of labor and capital through inflation and unemployment (or underemployment).
**** Waiting for demand to drop and some disinflation.
