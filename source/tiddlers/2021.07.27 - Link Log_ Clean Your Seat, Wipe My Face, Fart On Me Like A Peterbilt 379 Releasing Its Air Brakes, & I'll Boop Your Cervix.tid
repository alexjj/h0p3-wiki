*** gd, wasian-checked parasocial grill, we need to meet. I want you to taste how unhinged my thoughts are. Please empathize with this character. You will have moments of horrified silence where you sit and question, "oh my god, what was i thinking?" There will be plenty to question. I guarantee it.

<<footnotes "s" "A shoutout to the unhinged [[anon]] who goes by the [[alias]] nightsky2020. I will remind everyone that the 'maymay' section is not an endorsement of anything other than that I consider it [[salient]] enough to observe it. It's like looking on the other side of a rift, seeing what I do have in common. I admire many aspects of their work, no doubt.">>
