title: 2020.09.06 - Wiki Review: Is It A Redflag That So Many Dogs Around Me Become Pregnant?

* [[2020.09.03 - gh057: Good Sign]]
** I don't think he'll be leaving his job. 
* [[2020.08.14 - gh057: We Grow Shorter But Wider]]
** Doing what I can to connect. It's easier in person with him. I'm way more likely to let my mind wander with him, and it's okay.
* [[2020.08.07 - gh057: Caged & Rabid]]
** Dizziness keeps popping up. I've felt more physical vertigo this year than I can remember in a long time. Feels like I've heard more mentions of this year. 
* [[2020.07.31 - gh057: Floating Like Driftwood]]
** Interesting to see the different stories from folks in the tri-cities. Wide range of opinions about it. 
* [[2020.07.17 - gh057: Troubling Times]]
** I have no idea what it would be like to be a grandfather. I beg my offspring to wait as long as they can. The anti-natal arguments are pretty clear.
* [[2020.09.03 - DeathOfRobinhood: 6 Hours Away]]
** His extended family keeps getting hit. =/. 
* [[2020.08.21 - DeathOfRobinhood: Praying For Wisdom]]
** It is very rare that I pray with anyone. It's the best I can do.
* [[2020.08.08 - DeathOfRobinhood: LÃ©vitation]]
** I do not understand my daughter. Having that common interest seems amazing. She's got so many people who really understand how to make art in her life, but she just does her thing. I am clearly missing something. I'm just happy that she makes stuff she likes making: intrinsic motivation. 
* [[2020.07.31 - DeathOfRobinhood: Father-In-Law]]
** Still feeling like driftwood. Fuck. Lol.
*** I know a lot of people are feeling it. It's not a good sign, but there is oddly a sense of [[hope]] in recognizing that so many are feeling it. I don't know how change will occur otherwise. 
* [[2020.07.17 - DeathOfRobinhood: Bouldering]]
** My adult friendships have always required some degrees of acceleration in acceleration. Age ranges rarely align for me. 
** I assume it's part of the job with a visual artist, having the right eye. I'm excited to one day look through the colorblind glasses. I know it won't be the same, but maybe it help me make sense.
** His metaphor is almost literal to my eyes.
** I'm hoping they can keep his team. 
* [[2020.09.03 - JRE: K-Time]]
** That family has been a short-term beneficiary of CV19. I think it's enabled him to realize his fatherhood, to commit. 
* [[2020.07.31 - JRE: Street Epistemology]]
** He can have a mean style, no doubt, but overall I think he's exceptionally charitable in how he engages in dialectics. Most people have simply never had the practice he has.
* [[2020.07.16 - JRE: Stealing Work From The Mentally Handicapped]]
** The sign of a tradesman right there. =)
** It's really odd that we have this voicemail trouble. His number alone. Half paranoid.
** My recommendations were not what he was looking for.
* [[2020.08.28 - AIR: Links]]
** It's a good thing that he gets to stand back and watch Gage engage that man. 
** Cannabis seems to be something we all agree upon. Different reactions to it.
* [[2020.08.07 - AIR: The Magic]]
** Ah, suicidal ideation. Yeah. =/. I'm glad we are both in a better place.
** I appreciate how he aims to build. It's super nice to be able to emulate being in the same room. It's rare that it works out like that with people I've met offline.
* [[2020.08.17 - AIR: Music]]
** Interesting choices in that creation. I can see it. Who actually cares about him? This is one of the terribly unfun parts of social media.
* [[2020.09.05 - Wiki Review: Fresh Air]]
** I aim to go slow and try to understand. 
* [[2020.09.05 - Prompted Introspection: Paying Too Little Attention]]
** Edited. That is not going to be a fun question to answer again and again. Maybe I need to increase how often I do.
*** Could weight the questions.
* [[2020.09.05 - TDL: Wisely Embrace Truculence]]
** I think we should hold off worrying about the nook. I really like the idea for wherever we move. I need very little.
** I want wherever we live to be prepared to enable another family to live with us. We've done it before, and we should do it again (even though it can be insanely painful).
* [[2020.09.05 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Skin]]
** I'm leaving the errors in here. Enjoying the [[Chatlog]] like feature.
** Applied Metaethical Perfectionism would likely include way more use of sextoys around the globe. 
* [[2020.07.30 - AIR: Linked]]
** I have no business RPing. Most of the millennials in our fam seem to care for it that much at the end of the day.
* [[2020.07.19 - AIR: The Surgery]]
** Not much I can do from this end. I am glad that [[JRE]] jumped in to catch him after the surgery.
** I'm so relieved that he was able to get the surgery. This has been a point of hell for him for a long time. I was not optimistic he'd be able to have it in the timeframe available.
* [[2020.07.13 - AIR: Can't Sleep]]
** Even the idea of having dinner with our donors at this point sounds like pure hell.
