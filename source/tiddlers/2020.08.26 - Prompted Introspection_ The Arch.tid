!! What is one of your favorite works of art?

I still don't have a satisfactory definition of [[Art]], and I'd like to avoid <<tag "Library">>favorites I've already picked out because this question is so wide open. Alright, I've got one that maybe some folks won't think counts as art, but I do: //The Gateway Arch// of St. Louis. I've enjoyed my visits to it, it's neat how they built it, and you really feel like you are in something special as you go up to the top in it. I don't think it really serves a purpose beyond being [[beautiful]], but it points to a shape that feels anciently useful while looking like a spaceship.
