"""
has [[k0sh3k]] shown you any of the stuff we put on facebook this weekend, with the fire and songs an aw? we had a tiny bit of whisky which we drank at the fire. Ed only goes to the shop first thing so it's as quick as possible, but you're not allowed to buy alcohol here before 10am (some  profound magick trick to heal scotland of alcoholism - which apparently they dinnae have in england and wales - hahahahahahaha!) anyway... so we have nae nothin. It doesnae matter generally, b ut woulda been nice to have some beers for the fire, even Ed said so. And if Ed said so, it's not the latent-buried-functional-alcoholic in me üòù

Beautiful pics and folk music. I can totally see the value of alcohol in that spot too. Would be nice.

Part of me feels: shit, if it happens, it happens. Seize the day.
