In many cases, if you "don't get it", it's because you don't want to, not because you aren't capable. Even if you must do so slowly (IQ lowers friction, but it's not necessarily a knowledge-acquisition-defeater except perhaps at the very edges, imho), usually you can break it down into simpler concepts and actively practice playing with them in a variety of ways until you have enough bottom-up particulars to generate a working model or grasp or persistent working perception of the higher concept. I admire humility and moral prioritizing though. We can only learn so much, and I'm [[fff]] too. Clearly, if we are going to be efficient, we must find fitting experts to guide us toward that two standard deviation tail.

Unsolicited reactions: it's not bad; your life is great. It's all in your head; so, take your meds and just get over it. Also, I have an amazing product for that. Jesus can fill the emptiness. Go outdoors, exercise, and smoke some weed. It's pretty bad for me too. What's good in your life? Yeaaahhh. Maybe this is closer: some choices are causally more salient than chemical imbalances, sometimes the light you see at the end of the tunnel really is an oncoming train, and some problems are tragically real and can't be sorted out by a single choice in a given moment or by any one individual either. Sometimes facing the awful truth takes absurd courage, and integrity is often sacrificially painful. We are often mistaken in interpreting anxiety, depression, and other forms of existential disorientation as being at odds with a well-lived life; it may well be they are to some [[dok]] an essential part of at least a righteous life, if not a well-lived one conceptually. Though, you can take your theodicy and shove it up your ass, okay? Further, this is not an argument that the inevitable suffering in life that helps drive our desires implies that the meaning of life is the reflected meaning that one places on one's suffering and one's will. Nope. You still are seeking The Absolute, even if you don't want to admit it.

I sometimes feel like a prisoner of my circumstance and conscience. I can elaborate, but it's so difficult to find someone who understands to the point that I feel decreasing motivation to build relationships beyond compunction. Though I think of myself as an extrovert with the right people, I'm increasingly convinced of the futility. It sometimes feels impossible for me to reach out, but I know I'm not the only one. Don't worry, I too will ignore my neurodivergent stress until I grow numb; I'll sublimate my circumstances through a distraction of anchoring myself in isolation. It's gonna work.

I want to womanify those objects.

Selective requests for citation, evidence, or accessibility can be redflags. Easy rhetorical hack, though it is not always unjustified, obviously (and hence the magic). Furthermore, sometimes the term "pseudoscience" actually is just a rhetorical attempt to delegitimize [[REDACTED]] methods of collecting and understanding data.

Aint never heard of a blind person that could see a deaf one.

Le advice: one's romantic [[love]] life is a subset of eudaimonic conditions (and it turns out these claims may apply to socializing more generally, vocation, and perhaps many other aspects of our lives as well). You are selling yourself, even your proverbial soul: so, know what you are buying and why. Transactionality is necessary but insufficient, and excessive pursuits of self-sufficiency or dependence can be vices in many contexts (the usual golden mean problems withstanding, and further, I think these are difficult at any stage in a relationship). You have to take risks and engage in science; each instance is a learning opportunity. Notice patterns and work to believe what you don't want to believe. Step back, post-nut clarify, unmush, and grind with your frontal lobes. Do you even [[like]] them, and should you? If you don't like their mind, then you don't like them. Of course, a good relationship ought not be reducible to mere taste and style, though it is concerned with compatibility and types of inherent worth. You must share existential [[end]]s and some means to them even if you don't share many other interests or methods. Despite popular belief: attraction and rejection are personal (though obviously you must be wise in how you perceive and act upon these), and judgment actually is a core feature and practice. Beyond the reciprocally revealing demands of [[intimacy]], just because someone will embrace what you once felt you had to hide does not mean they are right for you (obviously, you have to communicate your needs, not just privately think them to yourself). Further contrary to popular belief, sometimes you should choose those who wouldn't choose you otherwise. Indeed, you can't please everyone as they are, and you generally shouldn't try (beyond whatever it means to idealize The Reason of Dasein). Yes, people can change (even if they often don't), but they won't necessarily change the way you think they should. Here's what it often boils down to: you should have something you value more than being loved (including loving yourself). Do you respect each [[other]] and practice [[The Golden Rule]] together? If so, the possibilities of knowing and participating in that which is more valuable than any one of us are open-ended.
