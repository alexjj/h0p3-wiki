title: 2021.10.16 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: sure, mmmhmm, yeah

Woke at 6? Meditation. That girl is still up. Gonna be like pulling teeth to get her chores done, I assume. I had a bunch of fruit. [[ASK]]ing. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time!<<ref "w">> [[TTTOTW]]. Woke offspring, assignments (I estimate my daughter is running on 3 hours of sleep, spending far too much time dancing in her room while talking to people).<<ref "s">>

She came down after her meeting. //Skintime// (I'm starving) and wrestling. She eventually convinced me that we should go outside. UGH. But, the bed, it's the best place in the world. The whole point of this is to be able to stay in bed together for as long as possible. What are you talking about woman? She's right. `/sniff`. Fine.

Shopping @ Costco with mi amor. We travel faster and faster through it. We have fewer new things to buy as our pantry is sufficiently filled. We're just refilling. Still a cart though. So many noodles and spices.  Lots of teasing. She's in a good mood. Hotdogs and hands.

Shopping @ Aldi. We had two carts, and our cashier said to us at the end that he was surprised by how much we got for so little. Yes, sir: that is my job. There are fewer and fewer frozen items to acquire. Picked up tuna kits for my son and chocolate for my daughter (the treats they wanted). 

My wife predicted a traffic jam. Unload. Assignments.

Shopping @ W-Entity. She found a pair of jeans (so hard to do for shawties). Snacks, sauces, medicines. I saw Sabrina, minor interaction. I got more than funny looks but two verbal comments for the second time that day as I flagged my wife down for another lane (she takes the cart at the end while I run them down). 

We grabbed local tacos. They were good (not as good as that truck). The outer tortillas were fried (perfeck). //Squid Game// is complete (a beer helped). Glad we watched it, but I'm never gonna watch any more of it. It's wildly incoherent.<<ref "a">> At least I'll understand the maymays. My brother was correct about the best episode, and my wife's predictions (including the last episode) came true (she would not accept her reward, unfortunately). 

[[5c0ut]] has gas and candy for a date. It's gonna be a good night for him, I think. Sent folks to bed. [[ASK]]ing. [[TTTOTW]] + LolWorlds.
