* The right to life doesn't include the right to be given the bare minimum one needs for continued life, nor the right not to be killed.
* Having a right to life doesn't guarantee having a right to be given the use of another person's body, abortion is not always morally impermissible.
* There are some cases in which the unborn person has a right to the use of its mother's body, in which abortion is impermissible.
