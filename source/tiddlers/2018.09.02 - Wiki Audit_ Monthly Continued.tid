title: 2018.09.02 - Wiki Audit: Monthly Continued

Upon my [[Wiki Review]], I decided to continue to give some touchups to [[Wiki Review]], lol.

[[Carpe Tempus Segmentum]] also a couple touch-ups. This is good to give it another once over. I'm glad to see this shit crystallizing.<<ref "2021.09.02-1">> I'm also happy to see it integrating further into the rest of the wiki.

[[/b/]] had a couple nitpicks

[[Prompted Introspection]] is reworked. I've added an interlocutor too.<<ref "2021.09.02-2">> It's much cleaner. I had a lot of errors in there. jesus.

!! I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THIS MONTH'S AUDIT QUA WIKI AUDIT.<<ref "2021.09.02-3">>

Admittedly, this is a lot of work. It's right on the edge where I feel like I should consider Retiring to mark the occasion. I'm going to try now to though. I hope to really integrate this into my auditing without it actually being seen as radical shifts for me.

[[Wiki Audit]] had a small botox injection. It was already very well-made, imho. Cleanup was easy!

<<footnotes "2021.09.02-2" "I've not had the need to add any more, but I'm super glad that I've got the one's I do. It's a much stronger log these days. I've loosened up in a lot of ways too. Good on you, sir. It's a worthy experiment.">>
