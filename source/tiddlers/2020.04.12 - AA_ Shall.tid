Hope your weekend has been okay. How are you feeling?

Am doing ok. Got the walls all framed next is the coop roof. Behind on college stuff but working on it. How are you?
Apr 12 9:49pm
You have been super busy.
Apr 12 9:49pm
Sounds like the coop is almost done.

I hope to see more pix if and when you can.

Gotta cover it in siding and trim after the roof and make the nesting boxes, roosting bars and doors
Apr 12 9:50pm
Sorry about being behind. Sucky feeling.
Apr 12 9:51pm
Yeah —just not wanting to do it and gotta get over that
