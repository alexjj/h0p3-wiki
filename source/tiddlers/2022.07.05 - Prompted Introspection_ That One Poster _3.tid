title: 2022.07.05 - Prompted Introspection: That One Poster <3

!! Pick a favorite photo and write a story describing what you see.

I don't have any favorite photos. I feel like Saint Socrates decrying text, or Saint Plato with the rhetorical [[power]] of the [[art]]s, or perhaps Debord with [[The Spectacle]], etc. I don't feel like photos tend to capture much of a picture in most cases (and I see my fair share of images each day). I despise how little of the real story (particularly what is [[salient]]) makes it into any medium, but especially photos.<<ref "p">> I've plenty of photos that are moving and important to me though. I have no idea how to pick out a favorite one.

Mi amor has this poster size image they made of her in New Orleans, and they hung up images of all the staff. Hers is full steampunk, and I think over the years she has come not to like it so much. Maybe it's immature or lacking in some quality? I don't know. I see mi amor, excited and proud of her work (as she should be). What do I see? I see someone who has overcome a lot, a kid from the American ghetto, holding her book as savior, smile on her face, ready to charge in. I see a little girl who survived because of libraries too.
