* Woke at 11:30ish
** Ugh, I'm fighting for my sleep. It's not great.
** I did have that badass dream though. I know what I want my X-men superpower to be: I want my level of arousal to affect the people around me in parallel (or simply additively to theirs). Lol. I'd need to be able to turn it off. Church services would be way more fun to attend though.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Walk+Talk
* Wife has interesting news. The second VP of the library system has now asked for her to be on the committee for planning the entire system of coming back. 
** That Hurricane Katrina disaster training, focus on user services, and initiative during CV19 are paying dividends here. She's had 6 weeks on the ground, and that's it. It's odd to see.
** I still must inspect it carefully. Bureaucrats cannot be trusted, regardless of her competence and moral intentions.
** She's tired. Asked her to take a nap.
* Cleaning
* I'm wearing my new shorts and shirt. They are so light, smooth, and stretchy. 
** Same price as Goodwill, but I like it more. My balls haven't been sticky yet, so that's pretty decent.
* [[Canvassing]]
* Check-ins
* Read+Write
* [[JRE]] called me
** Asked for link to bidet. Talked about how I use it.
** Thinking about [[AIR]] and listening to each other.
** Talked of WoW and PoE. He's thinking about more games on the treadmill.
** Thought about Matthew's legal positioning.
** Sam Harris' argument came up again. We're working toward the sticking point.
* Read+Write
* A canvassing representative of [[Justin Farmer|https://www.hamden.com/365/Justin-Farmer]] spoke with me (I've had my call blocker turned off for a while). Stepped down from my initial paranoic introduction, and then the poor woman had to put up with my gentle interrogation. 
** She has no idea what he believes (painfully clear), but she believes in him strongly. I appreciate what she did say about him though. I gave her a list of questions for him.
* Fireman Time!
** I'm having a harder time maintaining a rockhard erection. It reminds me of whiskey dick.
* Shopping at Costco
** My daughter had a difficult time having a discussion with me about how she wields her time. She's upset that Pots is upset that she doesn't spend more time with him. 
*** I'm working to find more time for her here. She knows what she has to do. Unfortunately, Pots spends less than 2 hours on his schoolwork a day (at best), plays video games all day, he can't take care of himself, and wants my daughter to stay up until 3 every night. His understanding of what consists in a good use of my daughter's time is selfishly and ignorantly piss poor. She knows that, but she also feels incredible pull from him.
*** Even Pots will admit that his mother and father don't care about him. My heart breaks for him there. 
** Pleasant shopping. Lots to talk about. Think they learned a lot.
* Pizza + Hotdog
* [[Hereditary]]
* Tried a few shows and they just flopped entirely.
