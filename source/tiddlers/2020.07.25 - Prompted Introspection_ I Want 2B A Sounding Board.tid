!! What is one of your greatest extravagances?

[[2019.08.28 - Prompted Introspection: Digital Kanye]] does not begin to tell the story. It's not what I intend to be my greatest extravagance, but I think it's part of the key to such a thing. It's an honor to participate in [[The Great Human Conversation]]. I'm going to push toward the superlative in this case, which is rare judgment for a [[Prompted Introspection]] question [[audit]].

My offspring are extravagances. I aim to [[Be A Good Dad]], [[WINTCIS]]. I wish I knew how to explain to myself the amount of energy I've poured into my offspring directly and indirectly. I'm not claiming that carbon footprint calculations can be easily made (though we must try), but for similar reasons I don't know how to even scientifically guess what it would mean to calculate our heat dissipation. The privilege is staggering; I've never met a man who got to do this with his offspring. It's possible that it will taper. Some aspects of parenting do. I [[hope]] that I can serve them in the same way that I serve my wife. I don't know how many years I've got left (still predicting I die at 50, but I must make plans beyond that too). I want one of my greatest extravagances to be paying attention to my offspring, computing on their behalfs, printing out my htop-like stream of data from my wiki, and interjecting when I feel I can be of use. I want to be their sounding boards. Throw 'em at me.
