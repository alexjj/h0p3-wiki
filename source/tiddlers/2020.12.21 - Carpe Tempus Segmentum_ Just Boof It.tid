title: 2020.12.21 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Just Boof It

* Woke at 3
** Must drink water now. There was nothing solid that came out of my asshole.
* Try To Take Over The World
* 28g 88% Δ⁸ otw o7
** Seems like capsules might be the way to go (plus I need a better method for noots) or gummies, but dosing doesn't seem relevant enough. Lots of routes. I see no reason to vape it beyond timing. Distillate that requires no decarb is an edible.  
** $90 with shipping, 25mg for a hit? That's far too efficient (RC territory), so I must be missing something. Will report back on my heavy metal poisoning, asap.
* Chilled with [[k0sh3k]]
** I'm glad she monitors our accounts so closely now. That is a change over the past few years. She watches all her devices more though.
** I think she's excited to try it out too. Why get a script?
* Set offspring onto their tasks
* Errands
** Lots of little things. 
** Trying out these charcoal air purifier bags (ya got me, no idea if it will work). 
* Try To Take Over The World
* Nap
** Hit the spot. 
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Shower
* Laundry
** I adore our new washer and dryer. They are the best I've ever had. 
*** I know others would find it extremely annoying to have it in their own room too, but it [[ltf]] for me so nicely. 
* [[JRE]] Called
** Trying lots of different foods with [[Bn]]. Signing. TV desires. 
*** He's become an interpreter of his son. I wish I were as skilled.
** [[Q]] seems to be doing better, though their heart monitor went off. Adrenaline dump, no sleep after. My homie is running on fumes today. Keepin' his chin up, but it's a lot.
** //Hunter Hunter// solid, but not for me he says. Gracias.
** His brilliant friend is feeling lonely, has no one to speak about her [[faith]] with. Seems like a great person to connect with my wife. Hardcopy of her wiki sent. We'll see if that introduction works. 
*** Thinking about the loneliness epidemic, and he mentioned how his son will likely have genetic predispositions to extroversion that will be complicated for them (my brother being just as much a hiki as myself).
** Thinking about occy, software upgrades and what not, realizing I won't be making it work. If they want it, they can do it. That must feel weird to him.
* [[MTG]]
** Son's MUC vs Affinity: Riggity wrecked, FoW on scalers, shackles, gg. Next game was far more interesting, as he was forced to O-stone his own board twice to live, but I still got there (<3 clamp). Despite B2B again and double shackles, double plating ftw; close one.
* Speaking of which: I fixed his phone for him. At least they tested their sim cards. Factory reset did the trick. 
* Continued on offspring's rooms
** Happy to see my daughter has swapped her drives. Her Linux system lives again in Phoenix. Joy! =). Gonna go Windows on her laptop and Linux on desktop (though perhaps dual boot, she does have that sweet GPU). attagirl, gitrdun. 2-in-1 will be solid for drawing.
*** I like how she has too much set up on her drive to accept losing it. I hope she will listen to me about backups. `/holds-breath`. 
* Oil Rep
** Apologized for missing the appointment. Down to urf. Matched.
** Dave's from the area, and you can hear it clearly in his voice. Even as a salesman, he's got that New England style of humor and rhythm I've seen my male donor's side. 
** I was right to be worried, but we looked at the control box. That's it. I'll jimmy a red switch when necessary (seemed to help it some too).
*** Also, if it does die, I may hit the reset ''once'' and only once to get it restarted. If it runs for at least an hour after that and then dies, then I may reset again, but not before. 
**** I asked a lot of questions, I could tell I was almost pushing it too much, but he also enjoyed being the teacher/salesman too.
***** He experiments with biofuel at his own house. 
*** Maintenance needs to be scheduled, but it looks like only the control box will need replacement. I don't have anything else I need to fix though, thankfully.
** As long as the inner blocks aren't leaking, it should be fine. A new one will only be 10% more efficient.
** Says my oil gauge cannot be trusted, prefers a sonar version. Instead, someone is adding a wifi device to my tank (no idea how it will be powered). 
*** Onto the guest network with you, untrusted device. 
** Guestimate is that it will be $2500 a year to heat. Alrighty.
** Confirmed the value of insulating the attic for me.
** He handed me a tool I was missing for our style of radiators. Ah, there we go! 
* Offspring and I bled the radiators
** Daughter searched for answers. One of hers requires a thinner tool than we have, and the other (as well as the bathroom) produce neither air nor water. It is likely clogged. I saw a sludge in another. 
** Unfortunately, I don't have the equipment to take this piping apart. Her radiators still have heat though. This needs to be done within the next year, I think.
* Son and I found a silly but workable way to secure his screen.
** He still has to get the wiring set. We keep revolving around the same arguments. That's how it works with me with everyone, I'm afraid. The spiralic grind.
* Shopping @ W-Entity
** We should have done the entire driveway. 4WD eventually got there. 
*** Also, oil was too cold. I've never had that before. Needs a tune-up (can you hear me, [[h0p3]]?)
** My daughter picked up her remaining shelves. She's going to have more than enough. I like how judicious she was. She's not one to spend her money, but I'm glad we're finding places that make sense (too easily frozen). 
** Son picked up surge protector for himself too. 
** I've rounded out the bathroom's vertical storage, picked up shelves for my wife, and have the cheapest belt sander for the attic now. 
** My offspring somehow lost the hooks I bought. Welp. Okay.
* //Skintime//, Assisted Fireman Time!
* Meditation
* Fireman Time!
** Almost passed out. Hrm.
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Pizza rolls, my ninja. No games, just relaxing. Son's been sitting across from me lately. Cool. 
* Worked on mi amor's room. 
** Getting what decorations I can up in the living room too. She will have a bookcase for her pretty things. 
** I can see I have a ton of small things to organize. My life is filled with tools and hers knickknacks, paper, and crafts.
* Sleep by 10:30
** Totally exhausted.

Difficult day with me for my son. Address, his room, phone, picking up after himself, etc. He's honest about it, and that is something I respect. There are days where he feels like he can do nothing right. I appreciate that he doesn't give up, and I appreciate how much he's grown here.
