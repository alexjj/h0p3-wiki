title: 2021.08.25 - Prompted Introspection: Designer Baby

!! You can make a designer baby. Would you rather optimize it primarily for intelligence or happiness/optimism?

Just because I can make a designer baby doesn't mean I would or even should. How designed, Lady Melisandre? What kind of happiness? Why should I think happiness and optimism are as similar or linked as you imply, or why are they joined here? What kinds of intelligence, and aren't the justified kinds of happiness and optimism in virtue of intelligence? Are you asking if I would produce a dumb flesh machine with an internal drip of pleasure chemicals instead of one that was intelligent in a wise manner (and we should doubt intelligence as being intelligent without it)? Are you asking me about [[Cypher's Choice]]?

I'll agree that most of the most intelligent people I've met have been neither terribly hedonically happy nor optimistic about The World. The highest levels of justified eudaimonia I've encountered required above average intelligence, though most weren't brilliant. 

The hard part as a parent is recognizing that one's offspring must serve [[Humanity]], and we have to make choices that sacrifice our offspring's happiness [[FTSO]] of [[other]]s. The requirements of that sacrifice run much deeper than most parents ever want to face, especially if they don't want to face it for themselves. I am reminded of the story of Saint Jesus; now, that was a designer baby.
