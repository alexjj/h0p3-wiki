*** This week wasn't a good week. I've had ups and downs, mostly downs. I've had an awful day this week, let's keep it at that. I've come back to a game I used to play, I liked it. My Hamilton paper is-for the most part, done. I feel like I can't sweep to save my life.
** j3d1h
*** I'm very pleased with how you've changed Andy, Vil, and Nines! It's fantastic work, and I definitely envy your skill to do these things on the spot. I'm hoping to give them big roles in Divarium. Your notes for building blackwolf-5 look pretty good in my opinion - messy, but useful! I like your Hamilton paper a lot. It's especially neat that you went into detail on what Graham Windham is currently doing, rather than just Eliza on her own.
** k0sh3k
*** I wish I saw more of your week in here! I hope you get the bob problems fixed so we can see your work next week - and especially that we get your school work in there! I'm glad we found you new course resources for engineering; I think you'll enjoy them a lot. Thank you for working on your Hamilton paper so consistently this week; one more pass, and I think you'll be done!

*** [[1uxb0x]] had a bad week. Not everything was bad, but overall it may have been negative utility. Still, there were [[good]] things to be [[grateful]] for. He ate really well, played some games (including [[Family Gathering]]'s //Dominion// matches), read his recreational books, and surfed. He's not been as active chatting with folks, but he's enjoyed several conversations with his family. He's had some frustrations with his machine and getting his work done. He went to the store to pick up his own shoes for running, and he made dinner for the family. He did better in his schoolwork for his mother this week. There's not much to go by in his wiki, so we're having to think about who he has been this week more from memory than usual. It's cool to see him thinking about narratives and characters with his sister.

** 1uxb0x
*** I'm happy that you changed XI or whatever it's called now to be less undertale, I think I'll also do that. During the worst day of this week you really helped out, even on accident! It's sad that the time you normally had for talking to friends is just now running. I think I'm gonna have a problem with audio-books, it's gonna be hard to read them while running, and annoying.
** j3d1h
*** I had a lot of fun this week. I built a couple of characters with real backstory (which, thankfully, is turning into an interesting and no longer painful process), helped 1uxb0x do the same, and did some worldbuilding too. I should really figure out the best format to write about Divarium. Everyone but h0p3 won a game of Dominion this week, so that is fantastic. I've been having some strange, and awfully real-feeling, dreams. Maybe they count as nightmares, but they don't have any particular "monster" or "antagonist".
** k0sh3k
*** I'm so excited by your school work for this semester! I might take some of the same classes you are (the ancient literature and the creative writing class both sound like fun to me) and I'm going to read that cosmology book when you're done. Thank you for working on your Hamilton paper - it's close to done! I think you did a really good job setting up your courses and your template for fall! I'm glad you're enjoying reading! :)
** h0p3
*** [[j3d1h]] had a fairly unproductive week, but it seemed like she had fun. She was fortunate enough to have many significant conversations with several people in her life. She appears lost in her RPs rather than the serious problems she needs to confront in her life. She hates running, but maybe it will grow on her. She accomplished very little in her wiki, but her Matrix color palette, Fall 2020 layout, and [[Bob Setup Guide]] were progress. More and more her eyes glaze over as she listens to her father exhort her to employ Reason in all facets of her life. She seems to be growing accustomed to the 2-in-1.

** 1uxb0x
*** I think I woke up for a little hearing a lot of noise, then went back to sleep, was that the night in which all that bird stuff happened? Did the bird scratch your face when you woke up from it? Also, I now know why there're so many feathers downstairs. I'm happy you've won Dominion again, now dad will start to lose his flexing rights! Thank you for helping me with my paper.
** j3d1h
*** Your commonplace books are getting much longer, and they have a lot of detail! Same for your prompted introspections. It seems like you're having a lot more fun with them. I'm sorry about the bird, I was about 85% sure I was dreaming that... I hope work calms down a lot for you soon.
** k0sh3k
*** Man, that insane asylum is sounding even better after this week. Work was crazybeans, I was emotionally rollercoastered. I received an excellent evaluation, I met the new library director and we had a lot of professional interests in common, and despite workplace brawls, I was very well supported by several of my coworkers in and out of Div, and I won Dominion twice - so that's all good! Meow puked multiple times, once on my bed, and woke me up one morning by dropping a still-alive bird on my face, but I'm still less upset with her than I am with h0p3, who watched The Night Manager without me.
** h0p3
*** [[k0sh3k]] had a helluva week. I think it's going to continue to ramp up for her. It's been interesting to see how her blind (for me) experiment to reduce her anxiety meds had some valuable results. She's been more emotionally vividly her, but her stress has definitely been significantly expressed too (I think this has been a good thing on average). She's been able to get some results with our offspring, and I am [[grateful]]. Walks continue to be tremendous, and I appreciate even what I can't remember about them. Oh, and the new beads she made for me were used so thoroughly that I started breaking them within a few days (I'm thankful she spends time trying to find the right fidget with me).

** 1uxb0x
*** While the thought that men can't not think about sex for more than eight seconds is mostly true, I'm unsure if it's false for you. I think you're going to start losing bragging rights in dominion, we've got 6 on IDK how much it's probably above 27. As per always, your link-logs are amazingly funny, or depressing. This week was a bad week, my wiki did a fuck, I hope I'll fix it by making a new one.
** j3d1h
*** Unfortunately for you, I can barely stand to read your wiki. A lot of what you write is downright disgusting, even if the rest is interesting - you don't want to tag triggers, and I can't parse it without reading it. You have a lot of link logs this week; are you trying to pick them back up, and do you think you'll be able to? GPT-3 is terrifying, thanks.
** k0sh3k
*** You are such a dog. We need to make sure our next place has a dog house for you. If I was going to own a dog, I'd choose a smooth-coated Saluki, so you're SOL. You've found a couple other people! Thank you for letting me vent at you and, once again, dealing with my emotional rollercoasterness that is the week before I die inside.
** h0p3
*** [[h0p3]] should sleep more. The world kinda feels surreal, stretched thin, and slow-motiony (or he's the slow-motion one) to him. He's made progress in [[Link Log]]s, and he's interacted with a lot of people. He's not happy about how school has gone, but he's enjoyed some of the dialectures and time spent on [[monster-16]] with everyone just chillin'. WAP and maymay drugs have been delicious this week. Oed the Squidipus is going to be his next RP character, broski.
