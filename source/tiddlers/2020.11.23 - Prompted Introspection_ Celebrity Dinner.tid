title: 2020.11.23 - Prompted Introspection: Celebrity Dinner

!! Think of a celebrity you would like to have dinner with. Write a note that just might catch that person's attention enough for them to agree to the dinner.

What consists in a celebrity? Is it this merely a constructed image, perhaps a crafted media process that serves capitalism? I can namedrop some living philosophers, but nobody knows who the fuck these losers are except other losers.<<ref "l">> Celebrity to whom? Moreover, I see no reason to think I could catch their attention, let alone give them a reason to agree to having dinner with me.

I'd much rather read and write with some celebrities, but I can see that meeting offline and VCing would be valuable (necessary for rounding out any [[hyperconversation]]). I think spending 10 hours in this wiki before we met would go a long way. That is the [[note|FTO: Notes]] I'd have to write. I think I'd just send them a copy of the wiki. If they don't have the curiosity to explore it, we'd be doomed anyway.
