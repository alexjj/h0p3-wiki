*** I'm rarely impressed by any attempts to replace htop. I'm not convinced this one finally does it either, but it's a cut above the usual. IO and net are things I do want to see, though I wish I was given more information. Whoever solves the memory agglomeration problem (even with just guesswork) will be the true hero of this space. I like seeing the heartbeats of [[m16]]. Can see the minutely scripts pumping and dumping from CPU to IO to net.
