Okay, if I'm going to fail, hopefully I can at least fail interestingly. Perhaps I should continue ceding ground in grief until I just accept failure. So, of course, just stop thinking and accept the wet anthropocentric dream of getting a thrill out of a glimpse of whatever this is, get a bike, strap a motor on it, ride around, feed animals, get in the stock market, smoke weed. You'll be, like, so happy, dude.

Most parents produce evil humans in the end. If they will not change themselves otherwise, then they really should not procreate or raise (though obviously, that's on the assumption they've not committed themselves to what is categorical already).

JustboutMcFuckinhadit! `/chughandle`. If they are based, do not quarrel with them. If they are shills, ignore them. Right? But, you can't just stop caring. Sometimes we must quarrel and pay attention where it hurts. It's not just for me or them either.

Nationalized socialism will still have negative externalities, outsource and capitalize by proxy, and continue to exploit the global poor. Of course, we still need nations to actively work toward global socialism. Most still envision either capitalism or collapse, with no other possibilities in this false dichotomy, and both appear to take up the brutality of the state of nature. Perhaps in denial, most are simply bargaining for survival then. I don't know how to give voice to the proletariat without idealizing them.

$28 Trillion debt, 114 Million full-time civilian workers, 83% of a median home price in debt per worker, and the only way out appears to be inflation. But, this should continue to eat from the bottom and widen inequality. `/squint`. That looks on purpose.
