; 354-430: Augustine

* The flow of time exists for living creatures but not for God.
* The flow of time does not exist independently of experience.
* The present is the inescapable mode of all existence.
* Our whole worldly being, including our intellect, is dominated by our will.
* To doubt anything, I must exist; I cannot doubt that I exist - I know that with absolute certainty.
* There may be other things than our existence that we can know with absolute certainty.
* Our soul is non-material and timeless, while our bodies are decaying material objects.
* True knowledge is of a realm of timeless and perfect non-material entities.
* Our senses can be illusory.
* God did not create evil, because evil is not a thing, but a lack or deficiency of something.
* To create rational beings, God left open the possibility that they would choose evil rather than good.
* Philosophers have wished, with amazing folly, to be happy here on Earth; true happiness is only available in Heaven after we die.
* We cannot be saved through our own will alone; souls who go to hell are damned by God's choice.
