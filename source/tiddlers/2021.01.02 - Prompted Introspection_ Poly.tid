title: 2021.01.02 - Prompted Introspection: Poly

!! Have you ever been in an open or polyamorous relationship? If not, would you consider it?

I have very little standard relationship experience. I've been lucky to find my wife so young. After and alongside my other moral obligations, she is the highest priority human in my life. After that, I'm in an open relationship. That's something that's been unveiled to me over the years. For a number of reasons, hunting for pussy is not something I'm going to spend my time doing,<<ref "i">> but hunting for more people like my wife is something I will do. I've never found someone who gets me like she does, but some are much closer than others.<<ref "k">> Even for someone who craves sex as much as I do, it's not the most important part of an open [[intimate]] relationship to me. Trust and shared telos mean so much more. I try to keep my mind open even on these fronts, but it is an unlikely {[[Dream]]}. Maybe it will happen, maybe it won't.

<<footnotes "k" "I know that sounds incredibly whiny, selfish, [[arrogant]], anti-social, delusional, or something unnecessarily maladaptive. The asymmetry is long-term and real though. Despite my autism, I work hard to understand people (and anyone who takes the time to consider my behavior knows I'm paying attention, even if I'm retarded). I do not consider it immoral to search for the fitting neuroatypical needles in the haystack given my computation on behalf of [[others]] ([[WINTCIS]]).">>
