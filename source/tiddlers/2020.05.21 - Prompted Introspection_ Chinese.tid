title: 2020.05.21 - Prompted Introspection: Chinese

!! What is one skill you wish you had and how would that make your life different?

[[2017.12.14 - Prompted Introspection Log: Skill Wish]] and [[2018.11.27 - Prompted Introspection: One Skill I Wish For]] are interesting. I like how I ended up choosing socializing despite my initial claim, especially in light of my beliefs in some version of the computational theory of mind. This question seems like a keeper, right? 

I wish I could speak Cantonese and Mandarin. It's an unreasonable task for me, and yet it would be amazing. I would have been able to connect much better with the many Chinese graduate students I've had the pleasure of meeting. I would be able to follow a completely different world as well. I used to run proxies for some folks, and I wish I knew how I could be more helpful. Understanding the languages thoroughly would be a radical shift in my knowledge. I do not know how to guess how it would change my life. It would surely be tremendous.
