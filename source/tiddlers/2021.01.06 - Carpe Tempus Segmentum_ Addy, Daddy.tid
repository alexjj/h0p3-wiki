title: 2021.01.06 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Addy, Daddy

* Try To Take Over The World
* Clean + Organize
* Chilled with wife
** 4 hours, then shitty sleep. =/. 
* Burritos + Salsa (1-to-1 ratio) + A Beer (at 7am, lmao) + //House of Cards//
* Sleep by 8:30
* Woke at 4
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Try To Take Over The World
* Offspring felt they had used their time wisely, and I avoided interrogating or even giving them the chance to say something false with me. Ahhhhtonummy. Sink or swim. Render it.
* Wife is doomscrolling. Discussions.
* Set offspring to prepping dinner
* Inform the Men!
** Talkative.
* Meditation
* Shower of the gods!
** I need to not run naked through the house. One day, people will be tired of being asked to shut their eyes. Neighbors haven't complained, yet.
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Chicken Tikka Masala, I like the nuts.
** [[MTG]]
*** Son's MUC vs Belcher: bad mulls for him, talked about rock-paper-scissors and autonomy.
**** Maybe I need to throw together a AdN storm deck or even full vintage.
*** Son's MUC vs Affinity 0, +1: 1-lander with glue and plates, missed a drop, b2b->shackles->ostone stabilizes at 2; clampcycling into winmore
* Head in lap, best blanket, did nothing but drift in and out. Dope.
* Put my wife to bed. Held her for less than 5 minutes before she fell asleep.
** It's all the mammals and dwarvish racket keeping her awake I think. 
* Try To Take Over The World

!! [[Computer Musings]]:

I've decided to use feedbro for exactly one purpose for now: keyword searches from RSS feeds with desktop notifications. Looks like it could sift through a fuckton nicely. I still find the best route is to opening the original sites all at once for those I don't read immediately on pop but wish to see in full. Seems to make the stories stitch together for me, plus the use of their tooling and seeing other kinds of changes. I doubt it will be necessary, but we will see.

!! [[Wiki Audit]]:

* [[Readme]]'s button had some fixes. Unicode saves the day again: it looks like a colon again in my filesystem now. 
* [[Hao 2 Search Dis Wiki]] continues to be fleshed out. Search is fundamental to using this object. Even my memory of it isn't good enough to get the answers I'm looking for without it (though I can navigate from [[Root]] to a decent amount of the [[ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱]]). I need to encourage newer users especially to recognize the options here. I think it sets this work apart.
