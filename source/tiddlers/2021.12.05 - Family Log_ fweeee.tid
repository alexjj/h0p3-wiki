!! How has your health been this week?

* 1uxb0x
** It was fine.
* j3d1h
** foine
* k0sh3k
** I had a brief crazy stomach problem, but otherwise - tired, of course, but well.
*** It doesn't help when you accidentally take vitamin D instead of melatonin right before bed.
* h0p3
** Huge swings in libido. Rumination. GI problem one night. However, I felt good this week overall. I am [[grateful]] to be able to take a night of bad sleep like it's nothing.
* ASK
** Ups and downs. I feel like hammered horse shit today. I didn't trust myself and gave myself a sugar low. I wasn't being a pig, I actually needed those carbs. We REALLY need more Ibuprofen. I am blissfully sore from the swordfighting yesterday, the headache is the issue. It's asymmetrical, spiky, and vaguely acidic.

!! What was interesting to you last week?

* The Asian Market, and, of course, pork buns.
* Spent plenty of time looking at pretty picture and thinking about [[Outopos]] et al.
* Magnus Carlsen is stomping
* Everyone likes CAPOW bread.
** Moar, plz. Banana nut, especially (5 loaves, maybe a couple fish too)
* I fell down a Voiceplay rabbithole.
** I shared Voiceplay and Home Free good news with lots of student staff. Spreading the love.
* I got to enjoy vasts amount of time for games-not just video games.

!! Outside of our immediate family, who did we have significant social interactions with? 

* [[DarkMX]] users and dev, Arathorn, [[Root Users]], [[Killcoin]], [[ASmith]], [[Jaxx]], [[T-Money]]
* Future Librarian
** You were //so// rude to that young man, making him stay outside in the cold. He probably learned all he needed to know about librarianship from your "hospitality."
* JasH.
* Lots of students starting final projects/papers.
* Smokey & Randy, Butter, weakseed, jj, cap

!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family (including ourselves)?

* 1uxb0x
** I've managed to be getting my work done for more than a week, which is an improvement.
** You did a good job figuring out what was flipping the breaker, which is much appreciated!
*** And, you were careful in moving things around to get to the breaker. I appreciate how you're thinking about how you actions affect others, even in the small things (not an easy task for an autist).
** Thank you for your woodworking for the furniture of my room. I respect your concern for safety throughout the process.
** Thank you for sorting through computer cables and equipment with me. 
** Thanks for covering whatever I can't when we do chores.
** I greatly enjoyed sparring with you and look forward to doing it a lot! It will only get more fun as we all gain skill.
* j3d1h
** I think I'm good at appealing to people's wants without sacrificing the right choice.
** I like the idea of you making a game on Tinderbox; game creation is nifty!
** Thank you for helping me hang pictures in my room.
** You think correctly. I truly have no higher praise. You are right in ways that the general population is not currently capable of grasping. Your dream is ood.
** Thank you for trying out sparring with me.
* k0sh3k
** Thank you for tirelessly hunting for media for us to consume together. It practically requires a librarian to do it at this point.
** You've gotten to the point on your instrument that it's music I want to listen to for hours. I hope you will continue to play for us.
** You've grown more adept at dealing with cold weather over the years. Do you think you'll one day become someone who might even enjoy it, maybe even a leetle? (while we still have it)
*** No.
** Thank you for the cupcakes! You're always lookin' out for me. <3.
** Thank you for including me in the daily advent. I appreciate it. It is letting much of the pressure out of the irrational parts of my phobia.
*** <3 Thank you for joining us!
**** I know I don't usually attend, but please leave the dark chocolates for me. Those are the ones with the concentrated evil in them. I'll take care of those for yall.
** Thank you for paying attention to our sleep schedule.
** You're good at coming up with constructive criticism, even in areas you don't have much practice with.
* h0p3
** Being near you is like a desert getting the first rain of the season. I feel more alive than I have in years. I hope this uncanny sympatico only deepens. 
*** <3
** Thank you for supporting my crazy hyperobsessions, even when they tend to be short-term!
** Thank you for the weighted blanket-it's pretty good!
** Thanks for notifying me about that game, it looks pretty cool.
** I feel like I've done an alright job figuring out what I want given what I have and have to do.
* ASK
** The food you make is absolutely amazing. (Very unique too - definitely a good thing, I like trying new foods!)
** Of course, I like the [[Text Art]] in your wiki! I'm looking forward to combing through the entire collection for [[gem]]s.
** Thank you for making the swords for the kiddos and playing with them!
*** It is rare that they enjoy physical activities. I'm glad they enjoyed this one. 
** Thank you for making food, cookies, and tea. Delicious.
** You've made our week fantastic. There are vanishingly few humans I want to see every day (let alone throughout), and it's a wild blessing to have you here.
** I appreciate how you dive into problems and the unknown. You let your brain run loose, and it's a pleasure to see.
** Your harm reduction concerns continue to show up again and again, from zlam to boffers and more.
** I greatly enjoyed sparring with you!
** You did a pretty good job holding yourself together. Try to figure out how to do it without the hiding things. It would have gone better if you mentioned it when you knew it would become a problem.
