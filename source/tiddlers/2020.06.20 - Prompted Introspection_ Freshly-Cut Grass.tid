title: 2020.06.20 - Prompted Introspection: Freshly-Cut Grass

!! What is a smell that you remember from growing up?

I had considered modifying this question. It's not precise enough, and it's too narrow in the timeslice scoping. I'm going to run with it though. [[2019.04.18 - Prompted Introspection: Name That Smell]] brings up an odd point: maybe my sense-deficiencies allow me to spend more computation on the classic rationalist and idealist's philosophical enterprises or at least limits the probability that I would be drawn too far by empiricism (despite detailed perceptions). That artificially reduced search space might be a good thing in a way, limiting distraction.<<ref "t">>

Alright, I remember the smell of freshly cut grass. I do not have fond memories of this practice of abiding by irredeemable social conventions for the sake of my donors' social status and conveniently conservative attitudes. It reminds me that I want a house in the woods. Sans the gasoline and sweat, I like the smell of cut grass though. If yellow-green (and even the bluegrass of Kentuckiana) as a color had a synesthesial smell, it would be freshly-cut grass fo'sho'.
