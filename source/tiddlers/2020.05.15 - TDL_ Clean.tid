title: 2020.05.15 - TDL: Clean

* Your house needs to be cleaned.
** Your son's room is utter chaos. He knows better than to accept your help, but he probably needs it.
* We could shop, but I like burning what we've got. Try to wait until Monday, yeah?
* Maybe practice PLLs. Would be nice to have those set.
* You'll need to figure out how to set up Proxmox here soon.
** Installation media might be worthy.
* Date. =)
