Hell yeah. Congratz on the sex and meatspace [[intimacy]], `/high-5`. If and when you feel comfortable, I'd like to hear more about her.<<ref "a">> 

> The last post was super long so lets try to tackle it one at a time

`/nod`. I use a lot of words; I have Geschwind Syndrome. I'm a special kind of retard, itellyawhat. =D. The current record holder for the longest piece is to Sir Brother [[DeathOfRobinhood]] in a [[Leet]] [[letter]] I spent a long time thinking {[[about]]}: [[2019.06.25 - DeathOfRobinhood: The Chickenscratch Confession Booktour]].<<ref "w">>

Please take all the time you need (even if it may be years*). I'll be thinkin' about what you've written for much longer than will seem normal (or acceptable) to most people, though I do not claim to be a sufficiently wise interpreter. Breaking it up into parts is a pleasure and an honor, and I will hold off on completely responding (you'll still receive "acks" of acknowledgement to each message*) so that I can think about your digested messages in toto.

> Hope you've been well!

Thank you. I'm hanging in there. It feels like a sea of [[change]] (not a [[Whirlwind]] though), which is not my strong-suit as an autist. Mostly good days.
