"""
[[papa smurf is real]]: you guys were talking about an automatic host failover function a few hours ago `^^^`
[[papa smurf is real]]: i'm working on something so we can have a load-balancing + failover
[[papa smurf is real]]: but it's not so simple over Tor
[[papa smurf is real]]: we will need to do mixed intro points into the directory announce, so it has complications
[[papa smurf is real]]: we also need a back-channel connections between all owners, to keep user info and file listings synced up
[[papa smurf is real]]: (the latter only in the case of a network)
[[papa smurf is real]]: otherwise there can be problems, where a user has one level on one host, and different on another
[[papa smurf is real]]: so it's not going to be something i can pop out in a jiffy
[[papa smurf is real]]: also want to get on with putting a forums in here, hosted much like chat rooms are currently
[[papa smurf is real]]: and direct ip-ip transfers between mutually trusting peers, so we can finally download at a good speed
[[papa smurf is real]]: i think this is of the highest priority really
[[papa smurf is real]]: so hang in there......
[[h0p3]]: `/thumbs up`. Excellent work, sir. Thank you.
[[h0p3]]: Perhaps this is irrevelant, but just in case it is not, maybe this may be useful: https://github.com/rqlite/rqlite
