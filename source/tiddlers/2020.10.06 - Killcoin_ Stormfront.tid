I suppose almost all mothers are mothers of a child with melanin, but I see her point.
5m
What do you think of this image?
5m
Bitches be crazy.
4m
That one seems reserved, dignified, attempting to communicate something crucial.
3m
Oh for sure. So dignified.
3m
How you doing man?
3m
Ah, I'm hanging in there. The world is a whirlwind, spinning faster and faster. It's too much to take in.
1m
All the boxes are checked though.
1m
How about you?
1m
The end is nigh...
1m
Er than it was before.
1m
I‚Äôm alive, kid is healthy, I have a job. All I can need right now.
now
I hear that.
now
Your family ok? Wife still working?
18m
Yup. Everyone is sufficiently healthy. Lots of anhedonia and especially anxiety. Daughter's not transitioning well to controlling her own time. Offspring are taller than my wife now, and I'm pretty sure they'll be taller than me here soon too. [[k0sh3k]] is still working. It's been a wild ride for her.
16m
How's your dad's back?
15m
His back is ok. He just had surgery from tearing his hamstring off the pelvis, so that was a fun 6 weeks
14m
Ah. He fully recovered?
13m
Not fully but enough to do his chores.
13m
k
13m
Listening to an interesting Rogan show, you might like it. #1543
12m
I was just about to ask: you have recommended things or places to read or watch?
11m
Hmm, just listened to a really good book, The Sword and the Scimitar. A history of the war between Islam and Christianity.
10m
That does sound fascinating. Thank you.
22m
Not really sure what you‚Äôre into.
21m
Me neither, lol.
21m
That JRE episode is definitely odd. Gnosticism, immortality, and psychedelics. There's a syncretism in Islam and Christianity which traces back to many of the beliefs of these ancient Greeks.
19m
Yeah, this episode was crazy. You been out protesting and rioting?
18m
No rioting on my end.
16m
Protesting? Sticking it to the man?
15m
Nope. I'm a hikki extremely online keyboard warrior.
14m
My protestation is primarily in writing.
13m
Very nice. What‚Äôs that saying about monkeys on a keyboard? Eventually you‚Äôll get there. üòú
12m
Indeed! =)
12m
Seen any food movies lately? Shows? I‚Äôve heard good things about Dark but haven‚Äôt watched it.
9m
I've enjoyed //The Boys// quite a bit.
9m
And, I hate almost all comic book superhero bullshit.
8m
The boys is great. The comic was good too.
8m
//Hamilton//, //Jojo Rabbit//, and //Feels Good Man// were worth watching too.
6m
If you have enough alcohol, the presidential debate was a unique experience.
5m
//Lovecraft Country// for a few episodes held my attention. I wept during several episodes of //Modern Love//. //The Great// was absolutely dope. //Living With Yourself//, //Ping Pong//, //Fleabag//, and //Russian Doll// were worth my time.
1m
Hamilton, pass. Jojo is on my list. What‚Äôs feels good man? Is that about Pepe?
18m
The debate was hilarious wasn‚Äôt it?
18m
Yup. It's a perspective on pepe.
17m
The debate was a special event. Hilarious because it was absurd.
16m
Might as well give him up, he‚Äôs been adopted by the right, there‚Äôs no taking him back.
16m

16m
That‚Äôs like my favorite gif until the shut up one is common.
14m
Ah, I've spent my fair share of time on chans. I still don't see the creature as politically rightist in all cases and contexts, but I'll agree the "take it back" seems delusional.
13m
Lots of moments stand out in it. It felt oddly like watching history.
13m
I hated everyone on the stage, so it's a surreal spectacle to me.
11m
I just don‚Äôt understand democrats. Someone said it best ‚Äúin a time of racial turmoil and police brutality protest the democrats nominate a racist and a cop‚Äù
11m
I consider most Democrats reactionary (and hence also racist in practice). I don't understand them either.
10m
They might face they‚Äôre own DT in 2024 if they don‚Äôt win this time.
9m
A dark horse candidate outside the establishment. Bernie is just a sellout looking for his posh retirement fund.
8m
Do you game anymore?
7m
I'm a retard leftoid though, so even AoC and Bernie are centrists on the spectrum (even if they are villainized as being extreme leftists by anyone in the Overton window). I'll agree that Bernie is not as clean as many people might hope.
7m
Gabbard or Yang would probably be their best options.
6m
XD
6m
Good fucking grief Charlie Brown.
6m
It‚Äôs ok.
6m
I found my spectrum
6m
I don't really play games anymore. I want to, lol.
5m
How about you?

Replace JP with me and were there.
4m
I‚Äôm thinking about 40k. At least getting into the lore. Probably going to download Among Us for some fun
8m
lmao
8m
The blue-authright-swastika-extension. You a /r/PCM fan?
6m
I've not played either of those, but I can see the appeal.
6m
Yah
6m
I enjoy the memes
6m
Me too.
6m
I‚Äôd be all about a benevolent dictator right now, as long as they were right wing and Christian.
5m
Shocking illiteracy in thar. It, of course, gives me hope.
5m
Maybe Trump will succeed.
4m
Trump will succeed in what?
4m
Lawd. I have no idea.
4m
I want full on Handmaids Tale here dammit!!
3m
lmao
3m
Jk, not really.
2m
I just think it‚Äôs funny that‚Äôs what people fear.
2m
üôÑ
2m
Never enough pussy. I favor state-sponsored prostitution. It would ease the burden of many. At least a weekly ticket-punch would solve a lot of problems.
2m
Yikes.
1m
Who would you say is true left then?
15m
Just curious.
15m
"What is true leftism?" might be an underlying question to examine. It's a matter of degree. Saint Chomsky and Sir Zizek are reasonable examples.
23m
Saint Chomsky... lol
22m
Often, I evaluate based on the topic. I can pick out strong leftists in particular fields. Specialists are more abundant than generalists here.
21m
I‚Äôve been meaning to read his book
21m
He's got some doozies
21m
Wouldn‚Äôt you say Progressivism is the best way to get to that point though?
20m
I ask you to define that word for me.
20m
If this is a question of instrumentality, means to ends reasoning, a worry of limiting acceleration (a reasonable concern) and compromising through a stack that clearly is not even remotely attempting to represent the will of the people, then no. Capitalists own the process enough that there's only one actual party in practice. I consider most people who call themselves //progressives// delusional, at best (and generally malicious after careful consideration). I'll agree that one must takes steps toward an end though.
16m
I would just think that someone with your views would use the useful idiots of the progressive left to arrive at the destination eventually.
7m
We are instruments, but I aim not use people are mere means.
6m
as*
6m
Like me, I understand Trump is nowhere near fanatical enough, but I think he‚Äôs a step in the right direction.
6m
I do appreciate fanaticism. If I thought the way to win was through the DNC, that's the way I'd go. It's only two-party political theater though. Vive la r√©volution, ofc.
now
Look how far the center had been moved though. Progressives are inching the middle line further left every day.
6m
lmao =)
5m
I‚Äôll take that as a no.
19m
I consider the fundamental debate of politics (arguably reducible to the search for the fitting method for generating Hohfeldian rights clusters) to be a virtue spectrum between collectivism and individualism. When do we own ourselves and why? The idpol of libleft and authright are mistaken red herrings, in my experience. On average, the Libertarian position continues to advance in overall practiced political power.
8m
I'll agree that we seek a justified monarch in some sense, but I don't think any single human can be that. I seek the mechanisms for representing the will of humans. I do not remain hopeful that we'll achieve the necessary spontaneous mass cooperation necessary for finding and acting on the golden mean of that virtue spectrum.
5m
I don‚Äôt think any system can accurately ‚Äúrepresent the will of humans‚Äù on a whole. We‚Äôre entirely too tribal and prejudiced.
2m
I ask you to continue thinking about it then. I suggest there is a great deal to consider to the problem even from a computational perspective.
2m
I just want someone to look at me the way Stormfront looks at Homelander, is that too much to ask???
1m
You may find the modeling that FAANG (and the similar giants in China) engaged in to be working toward a version of such a system.
now
I think that is a crucial thing for eudaimonia, sir. I wish you could have it now. I hope you find it.
now
Eh, I‚Äôm not too confident it‚Äôs in the cards. Women are increasingly hostile towards Christian values. I might be destined for solitude.
2h
I think the FAANGs are leading us down a dangerous path and I think we‚Äôll see a tech ‚Äúrevolution‚Äù of sort before 2025
2h
That episode of Black Mirror involving the social rating is ringing eerily accurate right now, with the outage and cancelling of people anytime the speak against the grain.
2h

I would like to know more about the tech revolution you predict.
2m
I can appreciate the social rating and censorship concern quite a bit. I like that there's ways to fight back, but it requires a significant percentage of people to participate. Most people don't actually give a fuck about these kinds of problems in my experience.
1m
I‚Äôll hit you tomorrow with it on desktop. I‚Äôm in bed getting ready to work for the man, to fulfill my kapitalist duties komrade
now
`/salute`, Sleep well, sir!
