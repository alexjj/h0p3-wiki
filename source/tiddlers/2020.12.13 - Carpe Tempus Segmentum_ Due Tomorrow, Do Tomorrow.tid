title: 2020.12.13 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Due Tomorrow, Do Tomorrow

* Read+Write+//GoT//
** I made it through the final season. I'm not sure a single character remained intact as an idea. 
** Moral of the story: there were 12 ~~disciples~~ Kingslayers, one Lady Me~~ssiah~~lisandre, and zero ways to end that story well. 
* Fireman Time! x2
* Sleep by 6
* Woke at 1
** Yum.
* Inform the Men!
** Weighted blanket is dope.
* Meditation
* [[Family Time]] @ 3
* //The Walk//
** It's been too long. Also, the hills are very steep here; I'm not looking forward to ice on the roads.
** Christmas presents have kinda been an afterthought at this point, which is fine with me. 
* Portuguese food treat. Expensive, solid, but not even remotely close to worth the price. I can make that food myself.
* Read The Wikis
** I got drunk while we did. 
** I'm still missing my offspring's writing. At least parts of it are happening on media of their choosing. They bring nothing to share though. 
** This has been an extremely long week. It felt like a month for everyone. 
* [[Family Log]]
** I'm looking forward to [[AIR]] joining us.
* Noodles
* Sleep by 11
