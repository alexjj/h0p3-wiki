title: 2020.11.28 - Wiki Review: Before The Plunge

** Edited. They've been thinking about getting cards for me for X-mas. I'm not going to name cards. I think that if they want to do so, they'll need to pick cards for decks they want to play. A wishboard for MUC seems an obvious choice for my son. If I were looking for Affinity cards, I'd look through forums and tourney decklists for ideas (I'm fine if the decks are transformed, I can always just build them again).

** I don't think everyone needs the beating drum by which to march. It keeps me steadier than I would be otherwise. I still used a metronome for a long time while playing piano too.

** In some ways, it has felt closer to what it's like to not have offspring lately (maybe 80% of the load off). It has been a relief in some respects. Breaking through the water to breathe. Reminds me of what it was like in our first year of marriage somewhat, a lifetime ago. I assume we will plunge again.
