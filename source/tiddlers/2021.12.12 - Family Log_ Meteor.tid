!! How has your health been this week?

* 1uxb0x
** My health has been worse than normal because of less sleep than I'd prefer, and a big nosebleed.
* j3d1h
** decent, but i keep waking up earlier than 7:30
* k0sh3k
**  Good news: I got my booster! Bad news: the booster made me so very sick. 
* h0p3
** Rumination, sleep disturbance, but nothing I can't handle. Cake compared to most of adulthood. Walking was much needed. I've felt good.
* ASK
** I am steadily improving. I am stressing less over poor sleep, as a couple nights without it wont kill me (anymore, lol) I have successfully slept every night this week! Tummy troubles. I started a new supplement, It was expected.

---
!! What was interesting to you last week?

*I successfully stole, modified, and implemented a macro! I also pointed out where h0p3's went wrong for him, lol.
** =D
* LSF pickup went smoother this time; I don't know why. 
** Sounds like a programmer to me (not convinced any ever escape it). It worked this time, and you helped make it happen, but not sure which parts did the work. I'm not sure how far tacit knowledge extends.
* I really do not do well if I forget my vitamin d; it cascades into days of badness. 
* I played some SS14, and met a new friend.
* Life in general was interesting?

---
!! Outside of our immediate family, who did we have significant social interactions with? 

* Kevin of [[DarkMX]], [[Variety Creepy]], [[Root Users]], [[@: All]] (not sure if this is actually different from normal though), [[Anon]]s, [[ASmith]], Art Group, [[Jaxx]], [[search_social]]
* Smokey & Randy, Butter, jj
* JRE, KatieK, SCOPA, all my potential evaluators 
* Coal.

---
!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family (including ourselves)?

* 1uxb0x
** I'm proud of my work for Permaculture this week.
** Your laptop is lookin' good, sir. I think it's ambitious and [[awe]]some that you are jumping into [[Rust]]. 
*** I like that when you don't have something to work on, you find something to work on. Dope.
**  I love that you take constructive criticism well, and even joke around about it - like when I'm correcting your school work and we just riff on, say, incinerating (sp? - no, that's correct [lmao]) people rather than incarcerating them. You don't only accept correction graciously, you accept it with a sense of humor. 
*** You too, love.
** thanks for relaying the reason i was absent to smokey/randy/butter for me.
** Thank you for inviting me to game with you! The effort you put into including me is very kind. Also, Thanks for the swordfighting!
* j3d1h
** i think i'm good at balancing everyone's needs in a conversation.
** You have worked to maintain some order in your room this week.
** You seemed to do your school work this week without intervention. `/thumbs-up`
** You are amazing to have in [[The Den]] as we livechat with [[Anon]]s on le o'schmeegles, precious. You change how we think together. It's my honor and pleasure, madame. 
** I've enjoyed continuing to think about raTox and [[Outopos]] with you. {[[Dreams]]}, yo.
** I think you would make an excellent leader for the revolution.
*** <3.
** You ask great questions while doing your school work; I wish I knew all the answers for you! Keep asking, and never be afraid to ask people who ought to know. 
** Thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou for getting SJ's present done! 
*** And for explaining the art style. I didn't know that. Looks good.
** Thank you for making food for me.
* k0sh3k
**  Apparently, I can speedrun a 45-minute presentation into 5 minutes if I really need to. That's a cool skill? 
*** That actually is a cool skill. [[Antipleonasm]]ification, abstraction, filtering for [[salience]], wise compression, etc. It's a fundamental tool in intelligence and lossy, empirical, teleological reasoning.
** thanks for the commission, i usually don't do stuff like that.
** Thank you for doing tabletime, even if I have my work done before than, it creates a sort of deadline for me that really helps.
** The way you manage to get shit done while feeling like crap is something amazing and I really hope to figure out how you do it.
** I appreciate how even when you aren't feeling well, you're still kind, and you even make it look effortless (and, we know it is not).
* h0p3
** I think I'm doing alright learning to let things go (slowly).
** Our walks, on their own, make life worth living. Thank you. Please never stop talking with me.
*** <3
**  Thank you for taking care of me while I'm sick; I've given you lots of practice with it over the last decade-and-a-half, and you've gotten pretty okay at it. 
*** Gracias, mi amor. That is, indeed, very high praise.
** being able to ask questions without having to hunt for them is one of my more useful skills. thanks for teaching me that.
** Thank you for teaching me to get better at games: not just to play them.
* ASK
**  Your deconstructed chicken pot pie was amazing! I have missed pot pie soooo much - thank you for making it!! 
*** It was insane. Thank you.
** Your room is coming together, and it's downright impressive how you organize everything. There's a lot of thought that goes into what you do. You've an innate talent there. Bringing order to chaos, madame. A fae's fae.
** you're one of few people i can walk up to and talk about basically anything with. thank you for that.W
** Thank you for reasoning with me about how to make a boffer shield.
** You really know your way around a soup!
