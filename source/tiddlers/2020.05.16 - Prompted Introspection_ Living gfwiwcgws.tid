title: 2020.05.16 - Prompted Introspection: Living gfwiwcgws

!! Who do you live for?

[[gfwiwcgws]], ofc.

Oof, my last answer [[2018.10.15 - Prompted Introspection: Live For]] was significantly less valuable than the previous [[2018.01.08 - Prompted Introspection Log: Living For Whom]]. I find the pain of living to be almost unbearable often enough that my family have sometimes been the remaining motivators for me to live. This doesn't encompass all the "for the sake of which" of what I live for though. I aim to live for [[others]] more broadly.

I have a 3% rule. They are the people I aim to build my life toward and around. [[IA2DYJ]], and that means I must have profoundly justified verifiable reasons for ingrouping and outgrouping (much harder than it looks, as the principle-agent problem obtains even here). I particularistically ask myself what society must be (and thus who I must be) in virtue of those worth living for, [[WINTCIS]].

Obviously, I also am pleased to live for the sake of pleasure too, and that plays a non-trivial role in my life. I often see us as a negotiated Sidgwickian computation problem among all else being equal egos.
