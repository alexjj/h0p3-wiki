title: 2020.11.02 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Delicious Garbage

I'm doing so good today keeping my mouf shut. I've said fucking nothing. It's completely unlike me. Feels win/win to me thus far. I spent less than an hour reading anything real. Pure garbage today and almost no strife today. Hard to beat.

* Woke at 5:30
* Read
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Kisses
* Watching bullshit. Glorious. 
* Made breakfast for us.
* Read+Write+//Fool Us//
** Psychopaths spitting esoteric jive for retards like me.
* Took a fucking nap. Like a baws.
* Fireman Time!
* Clean
* //Skintime//
** Fireman Time!
* Realtor doesn't think we'll have to push the date back, but still looking into it.
* Made dinner with my offspring.
* Not much of a [[Family Gathering]]. =/. Offspring and adults split up. Okay. Like a mini-date.
** We sat in our PJs and ate while watching more garbage. 
** kielbasa, kraut, onions, melon, plantains, and a beer
* //Skintime// and video garbage. 
** Feed the beast.
* Fireman Time!

I think with enough positive affirmations, stretches, nipple flicks, junkfood, weed, and channeling my qi, I shall surely prosper. It's all mind over matter. I am glad to relax tho. Great day.
