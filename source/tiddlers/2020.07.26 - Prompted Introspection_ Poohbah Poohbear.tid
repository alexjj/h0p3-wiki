title: 2020.07.26 - Prompted Introspection: Poohbah Poohbear

!! Who is a living person you despise?

I can't help it, I'm just giddy for this question. Huge fan, of course. It's almost like Samwise and Lady Melisandre have both asked me a question. [[2017.05.25 - Prompted Introspection Log]] and [[2019.09.01 - Prompted Introspection: Bes Q; <3 LM]] are delightfully painful, and it's obvious that I will never have enough information to pick out who merits my hatred the most in particular or in ranking; I've only got rules of thumb for speculating on the practically incalculable and mere exemplars of classes of people I despise. This one is a keeper, even if I were to attempt to eventually spiral into answering "no one." I can admire aspects of anyone, even DJT: [[2020.05.06 - Prompted Introspection: DJ Trump indahaus]]. Some people shouldn't exist though. Have I mentioned how much I adore this question?

The Grand Poobah Poohbear himself, Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the "Communist" Party of China, merits my hatred. He continues to systematically centralize [[power]] in the hands of capitalists at a shocking rate.<<ref "r">> He might be the most powerful person on the planet right now (definitely in the top 10).

<<footnotes "r" "Recently saw a Chinese apologist argue that China, unlike the US and other Western Nations, is a market-economy in which capitalists don't control the political apparatus. Lulz. Nope, they are all parasites at the top of a pyramid. Burn them all.">>
