title: 2020.10.03 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Snuggles

Of course I want to see all the candidates and their VP picks die of CV19 in the next 30 days. Backdoor Bernie is something I would adore (even if he is a profound concession). I'm going to get drunk no matter what happens. My prayers and thoughts, ofc, are with the virus in this case.

* Woke at 1:15am
** Refreshed. Someone has taken the remaining tendies. There is a good chance they have also seen my bare ass.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Read+Write
* AFireman Time! x?
* Read+Write+LoL
* Many hugs and ass squeezings.
** I was her yogi, helping her with her form, aligning all the chakras, testing her heat, and so forth. It only stopped after my fart became too violent (quickest way to eliminate pity pets).
*** Most people don't allow me to grope them for so long.
* Sleep at 10:30?
* Woke at 1:30
* My wife has a feeling that Trump's condition is even more serious than we are being told. Might be right. I simply don't know. I can see why everything would be thrown pre-emptively at POTUS. Seems really difficult to find the truth out of that institution, especially for this particular thing (but, it's our job).
* [[Morning Routine]]
* We hit the hospital to get our flu shots. 
** Well, minor breakdown as we were late. She can't stand being late. Went the wrong way and wrong address too, but we were right on time (and it didn't matter; nobody cared). It went okay though.
** I'm convinced they must have some high-rollers pay through the nose in that joint. Staff outnumber patients 3-to-1. Everything is so by the book, they are almost robots that smile. Forced. Conversations were lazers. I feel uncomfortable for them. 
** It was a calm warzone in there. 
* Set offspring to tasks they never completed. 
* Shopping
** Bought a lot of food. 
** Girl and I at the front enjoyed a moment as I laughed and gave her a thumbs up directing the chaos. Shit day for her.
** Lots of expiring food today. We got it extra cheap. We even bought beef.
* //Skintime//
** A New Bet, A New Hope.
* Inform the Men!
** 9 minutes, world fucking record. Like lightning fast.
* Meditation
* [[JRE]] Called Back
** Kids taking turns on him. Yeah. I hear that.
** Rebecca is very tired. This is the most exhausted that I can remember of her, understandably.
** Everything is all blending together. Man is in a [[Whirlwind]]. 
** Gagging until headache, vivid description of that pile of shit
** Describing [[our testicles|https://v.redd.it/qxd5hdrukyq51]], googling for examples. Mine are wider (and not in an attractive way, if ball can be attractive) than I'm used to seeing (I've seen 10's of thousands of testicles).
** Inspector, asking for examples, aluminum wiring check, foundation experience, bargaining
*** Lowering my expectations
** Reverse KVM, routing
** Briefly walked through filter expressions
* Read+LoL
* Just Mary showed up to bookclub. =(. But, Mary is like the sister my wife should have had, so it was good. =).
** Plus, 1k page biography my wife read for the club was Mary's suggestion, so they had plenty to speak about. Mary is marginally better than a Democrat, and at the moment, I'll take that.
*** My daughter says she's just left of the Overton, and I think that's a fair assessment. Mary's not allowed to voice her opinion at work really.
* Made dinner
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Potatoes (sour cream), our dirt cheap steak was dope, melon, peach schnapps & beer
** [[Debatable]]: choosing good questions aint so easy
* //The Boys//
** Turn up the porn, please. There's never enough. Kinda feel like the show is losing something still. 
* //The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra//
** Of course my offspring adore what my wife picks out. 
** Nap in lap

Sleep schedule is still completely fucked, but it don't matter. No date, but her back is feeling better, and I got way more skintime than I thought I would. I'm still convinced that state-sponsored skin-hunger-feeding makes damned good sense (after the CV19 catastrophe). I nominate temples and churches to once again be the holiest of whorehouses. I think once a week is barely even hitting the minimum to sate the population. Sex work is real work; it's a real need too.
