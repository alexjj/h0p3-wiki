** <3. 
** Keep it up, sir.
** Yeah, the sword fight practice would make me laugh. =)

** Ditto.
** You are filling it out. Keep going.
** I'd like to see something you want to do for fun in here.

** Ditto.
** Hey, you are doing the thing at the top, the italicized "over voice" (fuck if I know what to call it). What do you think about that mechanic?

** [[title.Title]], please. You can give up on it when I feel you've earned the right. You haven't.
** We are way out of my league here. Your mother must engage in this work with you (even if she is not a fan of Bill...she's like, so over it, man).
** Seems like fine work to me, sir.
