You both like Networking.
You: Hello!
Stranger: Hi! I'm doing a project for college, would you be willing to answer a few questions about your job?
You: Sure, tell me a bit more about the project first, please.
Stranger: It's just a project surveying what people do for a career so it could potentially help me know what kind of career/field i want to be doing :)
You: Ah. Well, I may not be useful to you, but I will try.
You: Fire away.
Stranger: Yay thank you!!!
Stranger: What do you do as a profession/occupation and what do you do in your line of work?
You: (I adore that you are doing this on Omegle, btw. It's an interesting approach).
You: I'm a philosopher.
You: (I know that sounds crazy, but it is what I do.)
Stranger: hehe ya i have to do a complete stranger and I would prefer not to do it in person with covid or with a camera on cause people are weird lol
You: Makes excellent sense, my friend.
Stranger: whoa!!! that's so cool! What do you do as a philosopher?
You: I attempt to reason with myself and [[others]] about what is most [[salient]] in the world. It is fundamentally a political kind of work, one seeking [[justice]] and justified eudaimonia (flourishing, roughly-speaking) for persons everywhere, including future generations.
You: Not all philosophers engage in the practice as I do.
Stranger: And what is it that you do?
You: There may be differences between those who simply "love wisdom" (what the word "philosophy" originates from) and those who make a living at it or pursue as a vocation.
You: I read and write. I speak with people interested or who I believe should be interested in the topic.
You: I do so through a number of means, but primarily through my own body of writing.
You: I used to teach for money. I've been a teacher in many schools. But, now I do it for free. I too speak with strangers quite often.
You: This is me, btw: https://philosopher.life/
Stranger: Wow that is really cool! Are you working on any thesis currently?
You: My thesis and dissertation were on intellectual property. Here's an excerpt: https://philosopher.life/#2014.11.10%20-%20Challenges%20in%20Quasi-Lockean%20Intellectual%20Property%20Theory
You: But, if you mean thesis more generally, as in arguments that I continue to support and explore, then you should check my {[[Axioms]]}, https://philosopher.life/#Principles%20of%20Programming%20Myself
You: (that is a very slow and labor-intensive process, I write the equivalent of a 100k word novel every two months in pursuit of it)
Stranger: It looks pretty interesting and this summer I also took a philosophy class as well that I enjoyed too.
Stranger: Wow that is pretty amazing.
You: What did you learn about in that class? Have you any majors in mind?
Stranger: When you were in college (or when you were younger, was this a career that you thought of doing?
You: I initially went to college to study economics and business, then I was going to double major, then I realize philosophy was what I care about the most (and I was pretty disappointed in the courses so directly concerned with [[money|Socialism]]).
You: I went to college very early, so my pathing was abnormal.
Stranger: I learned about rousseau, hedonism, liberal education, and a lot more stuff. It was pretty mind opening and the professor just wanted us to think more about life.
You: I see. That's excellent.
Stranger: I don't think i'll go into philosophy but I think my majors are basically gonna be like your major in college with finance or marketing as the concentration.
Stranger: Do you have a favorite philosopher?
You: That's a hard one. I admire Saint Jesus, [[Saint Plato]], Saint Aristotle, Saint Kant, and Saint Hegel above all the rest, I believe.
You: Will you have more elective courses before you decide on your major?
Stranger: Oh interesting! They are all saints.
You: An honorific. =).
Stranger: Yup I will! Do you have any electives you suggest?
Stranger: ah i see
Stranger: When you were my age (19), was a becoming a philosopher something you were looking at doing full time?
You: I graduated college at 19. I take philosophy to be a vocation, something I'd do whether I got paid to do it explicitly or not. I did aim to do it full-time, but I think that there are significant problems with how teachers are exploited in the US (though, I also taught in Thailand).
Stranger: oh wait i also read saint plato, aristotle, and kant in my classes I just did not put the honorifics before them. is this something I should do in the future too?
You: I suggest a wide variety of electives. You may find critical reasoning is not well-developed in a number of majors (communications and education majors are examples, business too).
Stranger: Is philosophy something you also do for a living or something that can pay the bills?
You: I think that you'll have to figure that one out on your own. I suggest one should be willing to defend the honor of such people, to apologize for them, to read them as [[Straussian]]s even.
You: It used to be, but now I am hiki who lives in his basement. My wife makes enough for me to do my work pro bono.
Stranger: Ooh interesting one of my classes was actually called faith and critical reasoning (it was a theology class)
You: I've had many different jobs. Most people in our age cohorts will have to bounce across many jobs; you may find yourself working in a field that doesn't require your particular major.
You: Dope.
You: What did you think of that class? I've had some poor teachers in those subjects and some excellent ones.
Stranger: Oh haha, just out of curiosity and if you are comfortable with answering, what does your wife do?
You: She is a librarian.
Stranger: Hmm interesting. I thought the class was good, it was interesting although a lot of readings so that part wasn't that fun.
You: [[k0sh3k]] is her name (that's a link in my ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî± I linked you to, https://philosopher.life/#k0sh3k)
You: I can appreciate that. Did you find supplementing with online resources was useful or allowed you to understand the text more price-efficiently?
Stranger: What do you mean by supplementing? Like not using physical books?
You: In addition to the text, or, perhaps, even as a substitute (I've had students who seemed to have benefited from consuming materials that weren't primary sources in many cases).
You: Btw, I don't know your feelings about codex, paper books, but you might find this a valuable tool: http://libgen.rs/
Stranger: Ah yes! i use that!!
You: (and, if you find yourself in need of other digital resources or copies of books [even audio], please HMU. I'll try to hook you up.)
Stranger: haha thank you!!
Stranger: and to your question, I found it pretty much the same. I also use an iPad that allows me to highlight text which makes it similar to using physical books but it's not quite the same but it's much cheaper in the long run
You: Agreed.
You: Can always keep your classes well-organized, keep that data with you. I still use my old papers sometimes.
Stranger: (last question for my survey) If you could pursue any career other than what you currently do, what would you do?
Stranger: Oh really? That is some good advice since I haven't deleted anything yet!!
You: Noice. Thinking for a second, btw.
Stranger: No problem, take your time!!
You: I would hope to continue my work as a philosopher, but with a more practical bent as a trained engineer in [[computing]]. There are very difficult tasks that I can't accomplish by myself because I'm simply not skilled enough.
Stranger: Why would you want to become a engineer in computing?
You: To construct tools for [[justice]]. The workers must own the means of production in //The Stack//, and capitalism will not give rise to tools that are meant to decentralize [[power]]. Some tools require nation-state level coordination to construct, but I don't anticipate any will. So, I would hope to contribute to an ecosystem that respects the dignity of our personhood. I'm reminded of speaking with Emy yesterday (also on Omegle) about this: https://philosopher.life/#2021.08.12%20-%20Anonymous%3A%20For%20Emy.
You: Liquid democracy has to be technologically empowered. There's a lot of work to do in maximizing our political autonomy (including in how we tell the stories of who we are together), especially in what I consider to be a fairly hostile environment.
You: Representation is one of the fundamental problems I work on as a philosopher, and, as a political animal (as Saint Aristotle calls us), I'm deeply concerned with our ability to represent ourselves in machines that attempt to vote upon or codify some reflective equilibrium of our competing notions of [[The Good]].
You: Electrical Engineers, Computer Scientists, and even Information Systems majors (like the MLIS required for librarianship) receive training I wish I had way back when. (I'm a creature from the 1900's, ancient ;P).
Stranger: Hmm that reminds me of something I have also thought of when choosing a career or choosing my future. When of the things I read in philosophy class was how the phrase "do what you love" can be harmful because it can take advantage of workers and a way that employers can be able to have unlivable wages or bad conditions for the employees.
Stranger: The article we read in class is called "In the Name of Love" by Miya Tokumitsu if you wanted to read it.
You: I appreciate that.
Stranger: No problem and thank you for answering all my questions too!!!
You: I think continued studies in Marxist reasoning is quite valuable. That should be an elective you consider.
You: Not a problem. Feel free to [[Contact]] me for any reason. I'll do what I can to [[help]].
Stranger: Oh also if you could go back in time would you take philosophy as your major again? or would you have some kind of engineering and marxist reasoning as a minor?
Stranger: ooh thank you!! what method should I use to contact you?
You: I would have studied more Continental philosophy. I come from a primarily analytic tradition. I would have double or triple majored (probably math, CS, and philosophy).
You: I'm very glad that I studied philosophy. If I could only have one, I'd pick it.
You: My Tox and Session keys are on https://philosopher.life/#Contact%20h0p3 (something you should read carefully) - if you want to IM. My e-mail is also there, but I should warn you that I speak directly from my wiki. I speak with a lot of people, sometimes for hundreds of pages.
Stranger: Oh wow a triple major! :000
Stranger: Ah okay, thank you though!
You: You'll find our conversation (with working links) eventually here (in a couple hours): https://philosopher.life/#New
You: No problem. Have a good one, my friend. I wish you [[luck]]!
Stranger: :)) I wish you luck on everything that you do too!
Stranger: Bye bye!
Stranger has disconnected.

Plenty to chew on there. I wonder if they are doing this because it's mandated or because this is their preferred [[project]].

You both like Psychology.
You: Hello!
Stranger: interesting
Stranger: hi
Stranger: didn't expect any hits on that one haha
Stranger: are you studying psychology or sth ?
You: Oh. Sometimes I'm [[lucky]] enough to [[share]] this tag with folks.
You: I don't know what "sth" is.
You: I have a few psych classes under my belt. I read about it often.
Stranger: you sound extremely pretentious
You: My studies were in philosophy, which has a lot in common.
You: Oh.
You: Well, I'm autistic. It's not my goal.
Stranger: i see
You: Some people think I sound like a bot or a retard.
You: What have you studied in psychology?
Stranger: yeah, people need to put effort in to talk like that
Stranger: i didn't, but i have bad fear of authority due to having authoritarian parents
Stranger: was hoping to discuss that
You: Okay. I will do so with my skin in the game. This is me: https://philosopher.life/. I do not even speak with my donors these days.
You: I can appreciate some of the problems of having authoritarian parents.
You: I am a [[parent|Be A Good Dad]], but I cannot say I'm good enough at it.
Stranger: any remedies to fear of authority induced by that
Stranger: it's crippling at work
You: I'm not sure if there are any quick fixes, my friend.
You: I think studying the concept of authority and when it is justified can be useful. It will allow you to pick out precisely what is wrong without throwing authority out entirely. And, it can help you understand who is actually trying to be a decent person to you.
You: Unfortunately, depending on your station in life, you may find authority figures are paid to exploit you.
You: It's very rare to find a manager who has your interests at heart.
You: Very high rates of dark triadicism (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_triad) among work authorities, in my experience.
Stranger: that's good advice, i've been in position of authorities before, i'm currently a manager too, but i'm still afraid of my boss
Stranger: i empathize with my subordinates though
You: You have a very difficult problem on your hands.
You: My wife also manages people as part of her job. I think it requires a great deal of integrity and courage, including a willingness to walk away from the job.
You: Ultimately, capitalism selects for managers who are not going to be restricted by moral reasons in the pursuit of competitive advantages. I would predict that you would be replaced in the long-run unless you stop empathizing with your subordinates as much as you do.
You: What does your boss do to intimidate you?
Stranger: maybe, i'm not afraid of scolding them though, i come from a military background and so my first instinct is usually pretty rough but i compensate for that
not much really, she's actually really nice and seems like she genuinely cares about me, but i still worry about upsetting her (and her superiors also)
Stranger: it's irrational
Stranger: in a position of authority, people like me tend to be mean to subordinates
Stranger: reflecting their parents' behavior
You: If you don't mind me asking, are you a parent?
Stranger: no
Stranger: i cut off my family
You: Sometimes that must occur. It's very painful.
Stranger: just distracting
Stranger: they have tried to guilt trip me into reaching out agai
Stranger: every now and then i'll get a message "hey it's your mom's birthday give us a call!" or something
Stranger: but i haven't spoken to them in about 2 years
You: I do not know your circumstances well enough to interpret, my friend. I'm sorry that it has been so painful for you though.
Stranger: the childhood and parenting consequences are what's painful
Stranger: but thanks
Stranger: it's caused me to be a pariah
Stranger: in the military, in my friends group
You: I will point out that niceness is not the same as kindness. It is difficult to know when people genuinely care for us, especially if we have trust issues from significant trauma. I know that feel.
Stranger: yeah
Stranger: good point
You: Do you have friends that love you? It's difficult to find intimacy and trust in the world (I think increasingly so, sadly).
Stranger: i have no friends left
You: That shit sucks. =(
Stranger: my last 2 friends were work colleagues and they've ghosted all of my messages, skipped on some scheduled appointments we had
Stranger: to do like a video call
Stranger: i was a pariah everywhere else
Stranger: but i am married
You: Dope.
Stranger: yeah, could be worse
You: That goes a very long way.
You: Some people think that would make you anti-social and necessarily in a bad way. I do not claim that at all. Some people have no idea what it's like to suffer at the hands of pretty shitty parents.
Stranger: i was in denial of it for a long time
You: Does your spouse understand your upbringing and the difficulties you've been facing?
Stranger: i've talked to her about it but i don't think she realizes how visceral it is
Stranger: she just recommends that i take breaks more often
Stranger: but yeah i was in denial of the impact my parents had on me, blamed myself instead because it felt too "easy" to just blame them
Stranger: maybe it still is, but i'm out of ideas
You: People who have never experienced radical fear at a young age will have a difficult time empathizing thoroughly enough. Terror and trauma can even change your genes over time.
Stranger: yeah
You: It can be both. I blame both my donors and myself.
You: In addition to studying what consists in justified authority, I recommend studying the concept of [[love]] and the psychological mechanics of empathy as well.
You: It's often a leap of faith to trust all the way down.
You: It can be harder for those who have burned bad to ever trust again.
You: And, I think most people are looking for positive vibes, not really considering what they owe to others (even when they are feeling down).
You: It's difficult to escape the sea of transactional relationships to find those that really matter, imho.
Stranger: yeah trust, i don't trust anyone anymore
Stranger: crazy how i just forgot that i do that
You: I like the phrase "Trust but verify"
Stranger: a contradiction
You: Yeah. I think we face contradictions in trusting anything at some level.
You: The pursuit of certainty is quite dangerous in the end.
You: It freezes us.
Stranger: yep perfectionism
Stranger: it's the reason why i'm not in the military anymore
Stranger: combine that with fear of authority
You: It's interesting that your boss doesn't sound like someone to be feared.
Stranger: i mean i couldn't have it worse psychologically if i trie
Stranger: yeah, maybe i just haven't seen her in a bad scenario yet
Stranger: thanks for all your advice man
You: Ah. Yeah.
Stranger: gotta go
You: Np. Hey, HMU if you ever want to talk.
You: My contact info for Tox and Session: https://philosopher.life/#2021.08.12%20-%20Anonymous%3A%20For%20Emy
Stranger: gotcha
Stranger has disconnected.

I wish you [[luck]]. I know what it feels like not to be able to even trust yourself. Keep going. Don't give up.

Stranger: I‚Äôd say yes
You: I can appreciate that.
You: Sounds sapiosexual or demisexual, to some degree.
You: I can only imagine what political rightists and Libertarians do.
Stranger: Uh they probably fuck their guns
You: Lol.
You: Yeah, that's probably right. A socialist can appreciate the need for the workers to own weapons without glorifying it or even finding it attractive beyond a moral obligation.
You: Guns not in service to seeking power for the sake of [[power]].
Stranger: Youre very smart
You: Never smart enough, but thank you. Hopefully, we can find answers to serious problems (getting off consistently being one, of course).
You: How'd you end up becoming a socialist? Our kind are uncommon among the people I live around. Is that similar for you?
Stranger: I went to a very elite college lol
You: Ah. Was it a college known for their humanities?
Stranger: It was the university of michigan
You: Oh, cool.
You: That's a good school.
You: What did you end up studying?
Stranger: Law and social change
You: Lawd. Those are expensive topics.
You: What are some highlights of your studies in that discipline? I can't say I've met many people who majored in that.
