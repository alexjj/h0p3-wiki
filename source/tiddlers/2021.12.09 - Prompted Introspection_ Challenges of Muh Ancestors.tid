title: 2021.12.09 - Prompted Introspection: Challenges of Muh Ancestors

!! Where did your ancestors come from and what challenges did they face?

I do not know the fitting story of the evolution of life on Earth well enough to hazard a guess to this excellent question. I only have impressions, snippets, deeply fallible historical and scientific accounts, and so much time to spend on the matter. How far back do you want to go here? I'm an Amerimutt. I've a wide variety of nationalities, ethnicities, etc., in my genetics and memetics. ~100 billion humans have lived, and I'm related to them all, and I have no idea how to even guess how many of all the other species I'm related to have existed. This answer is for my daughter, of course: [[dialectic]]s, `/hand-wave`.
