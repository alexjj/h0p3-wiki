*[[Notage Ti.32]]
** I am grateful, yet again, that you take notes. I'm relieved.
*[[The Lightning Thief: 12, rough draft]]
** Wow.
** You're correct. It is proportionally balanced. Good work.
** I would never have guessed you wrote this, if you asked me 6 months ago. I was convinced you could learn to do it, but this is wildly better than I had [[hope]]d given my predictions. If you turned this up to 11, I would let you off the hook of much of my school work to just be your mother's best student possible. The art in her verbal work is ridiculously good.
*** Like: I'm straight up disappointed to see her co-workers at Yale by comparison.  
*[[2020.06.03 – TDL: 11 daily]]
** Gonna let it slide. I want to see your feelings in here bud. We all have to do this awful task.
*[[2020.06.03 – Prompted Introspection: Trust]]
** Seems like a fantastic opportunity to write about [[bias]]! You have the deeper concepts to use.
** Of course, I would like to understand my bias. 
** [[kicks]] is correct. You have a straightforward plainness to your writing that is excellent.
** I would argue I don't give you a choice but to listen to my judgments, whether you trust them or not. 
*[[2020.06.03 – Wiki Review: Burn]]
** I'm sad that you are in a bad mood as you write. I am grateful that you write even when you are angry. It is an expensive task, no doubt.
*[[2020.06.03 – Antipleonasm Analysis: Humor Humus]]
** Why not link to [[Humor]]? Seems like this was the perfect time to bust out that tool and continue building.
*** Part of the strength of the wiki, as you know, is that we get to use what we have to continue linking and telling complex stories over time. You should jump at the chance to connect the dots in your wiki, sir.
*[[2020.06.03 – Carpe Diem: General failure]]
** I hope you have a comment about not having met your mother's requirements here. She should see what you think about it. If you didn't do the work, at least do the work to explain why you didn't or should have or would like to have.
** To be clear, it's like 60% success, not a catastrophic amount of failure. There's still work getting done. You are in school. It might not be as smooth as you'd like, but this too shall pass, sir. You must credit yourself wisely.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** I miss this log: [[2018.06.04 -- Badass Log]]. I like when you recognize the good of your work, life, and self. Without it, you will not be able to pick out what matters in the world or yourself well enough.
