title: 2021.08.16 - Prompted Introspection: Worthy Lives

!! Are some human lives worth more than others?

I'm not directly interested in economic value of our lives as human resources, but it is a question [[Justice]] must pose and answer. No, I think you're going after a more fundamental axiology, Samwise (kudos).

Saint Oliver Sensen does not like to wrestle on this one, and I know why. It is all too easy to fail to be humble enough. Temptation cuts both directions toward opposing vices though, and we run into the Orwellian "some are more equal than others" evil. 

I make the distinction (and I still don't have the phrasing the way I want it) between one's constant 'moral worth as a person' and one's variable 'worth as a moral person.' There is a place where we are fundamentally equal, and there's a place where our choices define who we really are that isn't equal (there are versions of ourselves that are better or worse than others). Without even speaking of other persons, it is clear that we can improve who we are, that we can fail in a way that matters, that we can rank our possibilities to some [[dok]]. Of course, that some people lives with merit (or at least more merit than others) is easier to establish than picking out the ranking itself. 

As you know, I would push the button, but I would never trust anyone in particular to map it correct. Principled method and process are the best options we have, and we must always be hedged-conservative in this sphere.
