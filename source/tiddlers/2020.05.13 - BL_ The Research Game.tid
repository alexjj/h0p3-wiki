Hey [[h0p3]],

It's great to hear from you. Thanks for the congratulations. I apologize for not getting back to you sooner. I'm doing OK, but things have been a bit odd. I am teaching English full-time in HK for my visa, and that takes up a lot of time for research and things. I'm not sure when we last talked, but I got married about a year and a half ago, so that is going on too. And I have been dealing with a recurrent pleural effusion, which seems to be going away now (but no one is sure). I have been in the hospital twice this year for that, and they still have no idea what caused it. But I'm finally back to feeling better for the most part, and I would say I'm doing well these days.

How are things with you? It's good to hear that you're still in the research game. It would be a shame if you stopped doing philosophy, as you hinted that you might in an earlier email. 

You're referring to the paper that I presented at the 2015 (or whenever) Kant Congress, and that was published in the proceedings (Nature and Freedom or something)? I haven't really looked at that paper since it sent in the version for the proceedings, so for a few years or so. But yes, I am convinced that the only way to make sense of the texts is to read Kant as never speaking about the highest good as a duty. My interpretation is, I think, an implicit argument for the continuity between Kant's different treatments of the HG, and I think it solves problems about the ought implies can stuff pertaining to the HG. I just read the CPrR treatment of the HG through the lens of the CPR Canon treatment, and I think this avoids most of the problems interpreters have. When Kant relates the HG to duty, he can only be talking about our part in it, which is to become worthy of happiness. And that just is following the moral law, which just is what our duty is in the first place. So I take his point as being that the moral law relates to the HG because a moral person is worthy of happiness. This just is his treatment of the HG in the CPR Canon, and I can't see any inconsistencies in his later treatments. I have read the people who claim to see a problem, but I think they make a problem that isn't there. It's possible that I'm just not a good enough interpreter to see the problem, because I cannot see it. So, I honestly can't even see why my claim is controversial (even though I made it in that form in order to make it seem more controversial). 

Apologies for the delayed response. I hope you and your family are doing well. I look forward to hearing from you and about what you have been up to (and how you're doing in such crazy times). 

Cheers,
