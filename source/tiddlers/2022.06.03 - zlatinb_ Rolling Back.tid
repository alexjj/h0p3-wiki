//My bet is on hashing files that are mid-download. If it can't update a changing index.html file, then it probably will get caught with the wrong hash if the torrent download is occurring while MuWire starts up. I also very rarely restart by most people's standards.//

Hey zlatinb! I just cleaned out my torrents folder. I have a copy in my backup though. The hash on the file I have is mGGf7py7gu7dGZuNB8EIGSwPE1bVpoPG2O4Pzv91TDY=. I've not upgraded to the latest copy of MuWire, though I doubt that is the problem (lots of people download from me).

I wish you [[luck]] in the monastery, my friend. What leads you there? What do you [[hope]] to find and accomplish? One of my favorite logic teachers was an old monk, and my wife and I take contemplative living quite seriously. Thank you for your gifts to Humanity. 

Let me know if you need something else from me. I'll see what I can do.
