* A speaker's understanding of her own language comprises an ability to conceptualize the world.
* Psychology and linguistics can offer casual theories and language, but language is best seen as an activity of rational agents
* Understanding one aspect of language doesn't require an understanding of the rest of it.
* Words have meaning only insofar as they contribute to the meaning of sentences.
* Communication is of the essence of language.
* Understanding is based upon sensitivity to direct, canonical evidence for sentences, which is limited
* Speakers internalize conventional rules that are social norms; understanding requires reference to this social context.
* Reality is constrained by the possibility of knowledge of it; it has gaps because the truths of some sentences are undecidable.
