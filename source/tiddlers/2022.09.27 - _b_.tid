; "I have said, and I will say it again, if you had perfect hindsight, you'd go back and it probably would have been better for us to have raised rates a little sooner... So the question whether we can execute a soft landing or not, it may actually depend on factors that we don't control."
: Jerome Powell May 12th, 2022; April 2022 inflation rate: 8.26%

; "We all read the inflation reports very carefully, and look for details that look positive, but truthfully, this is not the time for tremendously-nuanced readings of inflation... Sometimes the landing is just perfect, sometimes it's a little bumpy. It's still a good landing, you don't even notice it... There could be some pain involved in restoring price stability, but we think we can sustain a strong labor market."
: Jerome Powell May 17th, 2022; April 2022 inflation rate: 8.26%

; "We're not trying to induce a recession now, let's be clear on that. We're trying to achieve 2% inflation and a consistently strong labor market... We think that the public generally sees us as very likely to be successful at getting inflation down to 2%."
: Jerome Powell June 15th, 2022; May 2022 inflation rate: 8.60%

; "The American economy is very strong and well-positioned to handle tighter monetary policy... It is a possibility our rate rises could cause a recession... We're not trying to provoke and don't think that we will need to provoke a recession."
: Jerome Powell June 22nd, 2022; May 2022 inflation rate: 8.60%

; "During the summer months of 2021, inflation was coming down month-by-month. So that told us that our thesis that this was going to be a passing inflation shock was at least plausible... We did underestimate it, we clearly did... In hindsight, it [inflation] was not transitory."
: Jerome Powell June 23rd, 2022; May 2022 inflation rate: 8.60%

; "We now understand better how little we understand about inflation. This was unpredicted... We fully appreciate the pain people are going through."
: Jerome Powell June 29th, 2022; May 2022 inflation rate: 8.60%

; "I do not think the U.S. is currently in a recession... We're trying to do just the right amount. We're not trying to have a recession... These are not normal times. There’s significantly more uncertainty now about the path ahead than, I think, there ordinarily is and, ordinarily, it’s quite high.... We’re trying to not to make a mistake." 
: Jerome Powell July 27th, 2022; June 2022 inflation rate: 9.10%

; "While higher interest rates, slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses. These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation... While the latest economic data has been mixed, in my view, our economy continues to show strong underlying momentum."
: Jerome Powell August 26th, 2022; July 2022 inflation rate: 8.50%
