title: 2020.07.21 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: The Chinese Spy's Peculiar Gait

* Woke at 12:30
** Dial it back, son. Maybe you should alarm clock it. 11-12 seems like a sweetspot.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Read+Write+Walk+Talk
* Accountability Meeting
** Went extremely poorly. I did not accept shitty arguments from anyone.
** I am grateful that they are doing some work on their mother's side (as these are the basics and socially required section).
* [[Guitar]]
** Everyone shall now suffer my screeching. Lol.
* Read+Write+Walk+Talk
* My wife gave me a hematite rattlesnake/cicada/shaker beadset, and we tried another too.
** Heavier and denser, smoother, almost metallic liquid squish
*** I really like that my hand changes the bones over time, but the feel of hematite is maybe just nicer
* [[JRE]] called me up.
** They all got sick this weekend (daycare seems to be a strong problem here)
*** Poor sleep too.
** Thought about our anger.
** Walking through his upgrade
*** Talked about `/home`, archiving, and building a library
*** [[Windows Tool Collection]] is looking dated, lol.
*** His screen is nice for gaming. Giving the old TV to [[AIR]].
*** Asked him to spend some quality time, at least a week, setting up the software on his machine.
** Practicing speaking with his son
** Atheism, rhetoric, dialectics, subjectivity, noumena, [[alias]], [[The Other]], Wittgenstein, Quietism, Fundamental Disagreement, Prime Mover Strawman
* Vapelyfe
* Inform the Men!
** I want to be her whore.
** My animal deserves a lot of lovin'.
* Meditation
* Shower of the gods!
* Read+Write
* The Walk
** The Chinese Spy took the shortcut this time...(last time it was the irrationally long route).
*** Perhaps she's exploring. She walks a lot. 
*** Gave me a weird look when I asked how she was doing. Lol. Yup. 
*** I had mentioned to her before that I can tell its her from a very long way away. She has such a particular gait (in addition to her appearance).
**** No, no, surely, the awkward autism will only intensify.
** It was a quieter walk. We were lost in our heads more than usual.
* Made dinner
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Chops (we made the house really smokey, like...our eyes hurt, and my asthmarz flaired up [anything but a centrist]), taters, sprouts, watermelon, apple
** //Comedy Central Roast//
*** I suppose my tastes are changing. Disappoint.
* Clean
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 4:30
