All else being equal, given [[TOP]]'s requirements are recursively met to the best of one's abilities ([[ITS]]): don't confuse being right with being validated by others. You're wrong if you don't think you need to be right about what matters, but don't just take my word for it.

<br>

don't use symbols of which you don't know the infinite interpretations from all possible perspectives or you'll be violating someone's cultural norms about other cultural norms into [[infinigress]], and that's the best i can do for any kind of moral realism, `/squint`

<br>

The [[CI]] demonstrates the evil of taking one's ego to be an exception to the universal normativity of [[salient]] truths. If everyone lived their lives as though it was all about themselves, it would become the very absurdity that socialists™ are decrying. Saint Marx lacks an ideal™ foundation, and an Orthodox Marxist never justifiably speaks to the is/ought distinction, the binding-worthiness of normativity within Reason, realism, or why there is something existentially beyond the contradiction of the politically libertarian ego and its kleptocratic property. The hilarious title of Postmodern Cultural Marxists, unfortunately, is often fitting for the posers; few are [[reconstructive]] or honest enough about the problem, and hence the skeptical, solipsistic spiral into post[[pleft]]ism in practice. No wonder ontological self-denial or world-denial is the epistemic position of those who face the truth they //ought// not have political ownership of themselves all the way down.

<br>

Perceptions of [[The Thing]]-in-[[Itself]] always have the empirical [[chance]] of propagating through yet another layer.

I'm not yet convinced each moral semantic state may be represented as a type of sum of other moral states.
