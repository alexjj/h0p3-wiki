title: 2021.05.13 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: I Am

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time!<<ref "w">> My retarded martini (it'll gitcha drunk),<<ref "a">> LolVod (unfortunately, plebbit spoils links too hard now), cleaning, laundry, organizing, and hanging aesthetic shit<<ref "s">> (that's how low I've sunk :P). The fact is that I still don't have a clear enough vision of this space.<<ref "t">> It's slowly congealing. I feel like an idiot. I am idiot, lmao.

Slept acceptably. [[TTTOTW]]

Prepped for a meal, chili and chips. 

Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Surprised to see the PKM General thread on /lit/ still alive. 

//The Walk// with my offspring. Nobody was proud, but we talked about what they did otherwise. It's a shame she doesn't write. 

Nap, //Skintime//, Nap. 

Made dinner with my offspring, chili.

For the umpteenth, my daughter chose not to remove her headphones while I'm speaking with her. She knows exactly what she's doing, and my patience is gone. Keep refusing to listen to me, to take them off when I directly tell you take them off, and see what happens. I took them and snapped them. [[Gradual]]ized [[T42T]]. I will go to rockbottom with you if I must. I've been pulling teeth with her this week. 

~~[[Family Gathering]]~~. It got heated for a moment, and I'm done arguing. We decided not to eat together. [[TTTOTW]] and talked with my bro while he vaped. He gave me a kiss on the head and that's it.

Cleaned, [[TTTOTW]]

<<footnotes "s" "With the exception of my brother [[JRE]]'s artpiece, which holds the highest and most central position in the room. He knows (but also somehow could never understand?) how much it means to me. It's a prized possession to me. I've got a handful of objects I'd run out of my burning home with, and that's one I'd be devasted to lose.">>

<<footnotes "t" "Though, I am maintaining the Van Gogh piece where [[kicks]] knows it to be. `/salute`. And, ofc, my [[ᛝLightᛝ]] has no idea the present I'm laboring to give her (thousands of hours [especially now that I know what it means to me] for something so simple).">>
