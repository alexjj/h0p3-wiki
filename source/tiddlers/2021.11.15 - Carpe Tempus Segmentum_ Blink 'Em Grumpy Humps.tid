<<<
Massage. [[TTTOTW]]. Leftovers. Sleep by 3?

Woke at 8? Mi amor was doing laundry.

[[ASK]] had a night terror, couldn't sleep. //Skintime// until she fell asleep, but she woke back up.

[[Family Time]] was excellent. It was a quiet one, and by 5, it is so dark out here that I was just falling asleep. People randomly made food and [[shared]] throughout the evening.

//Star Trek: Nemesis// was as horrific as we all remembered (except my offspring). //Skintime//, and I could not stay awake. Snores (sorry folks).

//Skintime// with [[ASK]] + //Another Period//

Hugs'n'bugs. Assignments for tomorrow. 

[[ASK]], [[5c0ut]], and I chilled downstairs listening to [[music]], [[ASK]]'s grafting of stories, and the [[letter]] I've finished off for [[hopesthoughts]]. [[TTTOTW]]. More data recovery for [[ASK]]'s wiki; I think this will be ironed out soon enough.

Massage. [[TTTOTW]]. //Skintime// + //Another Period//. Fireman Time! Sleep by 3?

Woke at 10? Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Hugs'n'bugs. Assignments. 

Shopping @ Costco with [[ASK]]. Talked relijun while holding hands, of course (what the fuck else are we supposed to do with our time?). Two carts, with A L O T of noodles. Also, they had mushrooms after many months of not. I picked up 5 containers in case I won't see them again for a long time. We walked the entire store for her to get a sense of prices (this here is a woman who has clearly done a ton of shopping on a sacrificial budget, it's a blessing to shop with her [though, of course, we often stop, as predicted, to look at all the shiny things, [[IHAT]] - at this rate, I'll be able to spot a smart poor girl from a mile away]). We got hotdogs and a slice as I peppered and stumped her with questions. 

Shopping @ Aldi with [[ASK]]. Two carts. Meat prices continue to rise for the second year, and it's more pronounced lately (and projected to continue). I was chastised for failing to pay close enough attention to a bag of celery that was already turning. `/sniff`. =D. 

Dadnap. 

I didn't get to see my wife until 5. Balls-to-the-wall day for her, and she's got more energy in her than I've seen in a while. Not manic, but definitely kicking ass. Eventually got her into a room for //Raw Skintime// wherein she recounted the flurry of the day (out of order). She's been on top of everything, no major tripwires over the weekend, solving problems with SL, handling upset people all day (one grumpy student is correct consistently, so I like her grumpy humps), twice finding non-trivial bugs in the system and bringing them up the chain to the veep (as he's the only one who can solve it), sitewide first aid training approved (and part of her presentation next year), more work on her apps, and I'm failing to remember everything. Oh, and she hit the store at the end. 200% ADHD productivity day. She refused me on the grounds that Dev was coming (who ended up being late, and we had all the time in the world to fuck, and we absolutely should have, but I will take the promise of tomorrow and be quite [[grateful]], and I'm very glad to get muh skish) and she didn't know and it could be any time and she would have to take a shower and because there is no need to justify any of those reasons themselves and so instead we literally wrestled until she had me in a leg triangle (I almost fucking got there mates!) and instead she let me taste her other honey (sour watermelon flavored, sick breh) which I drizzled on her (she knew I was drawing a dick immediately). She's just started some new vitamin D tablets. Maybe? Traditionally, whether or not she gets enough D has all the impact in the world. 

The Adults sat in The Commons and listened to [[k0sh3k]] play [[music]], shot the shit ([[5c0ut]] was less nervous this round, though worried about timing), //Skintime// with [[ASK]]. Eventually, pulled out my piano tuning equipment since the guitar tunar needs a battery (got some for her), and it's clear that the autoharp needs a tuning (it's been years since anyone has touched it). I think she'd be interested in me (or perhaps [[JRE]] if he really wanted) building a bass psaltery for her (I hand-carved a banjo before, so I think I could do this cheaply enough). Hammer dulcimer is also something she would want one day, maybe (might be cheapest to fix up a broken one, as [[ASK]] pointed out). We took bets on how my daughter would react to knocking on her door (as her mother was clear about what needed to be done).<<ref "h">> 

Ranga begged for crack. You betcha, loser. Scratched on the cardboard thing and took a nap in the catcrib in the scary corner I made for him (where I keep my own crack, candy, books,<<ref "i">> etc.). [[k0sh3k]] came down with me to read and write. [[TTTOTW]]. [[h0p3]] [[hope]]'s [[hopesthoughts]]' thoughts will continue to stream in. [[ASK]] came to join us with her tinkerbells. Listening to Home Free (and my wife knows all their names like a trufangurl - just need a waterproof bluetooth speaker with Tim, the basso profundo, humming for 20 minutes).

[[Family Gathering]]. We ate dinner at the table, unlike the savages who normally sit downstairs to drown everything out while watching a show with //Skintime// and nostalgia. [[5c0ut]] made an excellent taco bar (I had 6), and I have no idea what to call the dessert (but I ate all of that too). Dev arrived (trouble with the pigs otw), jumped right into //Card Against Humanity// so that we could reveal our true natures to him. My daughter laughed hard enough to cry again (=D). [[ASK]]'s prompt was `_____. It's a trap`, and, ofc, the winning answer was [[Hope]]. [[k0sh3k]] demolished us all, again (wtf); she stayed up an hour beyond what she should have, and I'm glad she did. Also, the melatonin I got her has an artificial sweetener (no headache this time, thus far). CAH > Jackbox as an icebreaker. Vapelyfe.

Put folks to bed. [[TTTOTW]].

Every now and then you'll see a figure in the corner of your eye, followed by a moaning sound and then a door will slam shut. `/nod`. In this case, she did in fact say, 'wat.' `/nod`. I've succeeded as a father. `/nod`.">>
