title: 2020.04.26 - Prompted Introspection: Ammonia

!! What has been a close brush with death you've experienced?

Weaksauce answer in [[2018.08.14 - Prompted Introspection: Brush With Death]]. Superlative problems again, so I'm fixing the question. I was hospitalized for pneumonia (I've had it a couple times). I got problems with muh lungs, yo. I'm hoping the vaccine I just got will significantly limit the chances I get it again (CV19 is probably going to be a kick in the nuts for me [grateful to have my inhaler now]; I was extremely sick in January [but don't think it was CV19 because I didn't have a fever]). 

I don't know how close I have to be to call it a "brush with death." Some of these problems are long-lasting, shorten my lifespan (definitely have permanent damage to some of my organs and systems), and crop up again and again. Was there at least a 2% chance I could die? Yeah. I hate pneumonia. The first time I had it, I couldn't distinguish the phonetic difference between ammonia and pneumonia (similarly, GWB's nooculur vs nuclear, like the problem of blue/green seas). "I've gots the ammonia."
