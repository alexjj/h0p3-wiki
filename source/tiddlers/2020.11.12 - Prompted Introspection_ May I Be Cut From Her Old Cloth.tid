title: 2020.11.12 - Prompted Introspection: May I Be Cut From Her Old Cloth

!! Think back to your childhood. Write about an article of clothing or an outfit you remember one of your parents (or another influential adult figure) wearing.

Despite being voluntarily broke as fuck, I remember $300 shoes (in the 90's) that would be repaired over the years by cobblers (the math did not work out, as much as he rationalized), something my male donor carried over from the Masshole private schools he worked to put himself through (back when such a thing was possible, though he will not consider how wages have been suppressed). He always had suits that fit his fat ass, and he dressed for some unknown job on high he wanted. Image meant so much. I remember his first robes and his first elder stole (I remember hers too). Iota Eta Sigma. I remember his silk ties, brass tie pins, cufflinks, suspenders, cologne, patterned dress socks, and belts. He never attempted to live up to his own words about Saint Jesus in this space (among many others). Hypocrite. `/spit`

[[SLT]], however, for a much longer period of time paid the correct price. But, back then she was a Marxist, a feminist, a scholar, and a humbler servant of the poor who resisted the temptations more effectively than most I've met, despite the enormous pressures applied to women (and someone who never felt attractive enough for her husband, by his own public admission from the pulpit too), especially women in ministry in the South. She proudly wore the same things the poor women around her wore when she started. I hold that part of who she was in high regard.
