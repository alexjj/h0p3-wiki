* Think About It

*** Feels so realpolitik. Elegantly aims not to step on any toes. She teaches fast. Feels like an enemy of the Rand-Locke memeplex.
**** Principal-agent problem lights up heavily throughout.
**** "Quick before teh call of revolution is too loud?"...maybe. I charitably hope not.
*** Very close! This is a serious attempt at the maximin-based [[Golden Rule]] thesis! There is a failure to speak of autonomy and voting well enough. The realization of [[TOP]] can't actually obtain efficiently without it. Yet again, Saints Plato and Aristotle are correct about the kinds of political thinking things we are. It is not unjustifiably imperialistic to ask each person to understand the truth as best they can (with what they have, [[irwartfrr]], particularized to the rules-of-thumbs of the context as best can we, and so forth), but it is imperialistic and patronizing not to give information advantages as fast as humanly possible to the poorest of the poor. Intellectual and experiential capital is fundamental to the problem. It must be both intention and infrastructure that empowers those who need it most. 
**** One of the problems we face in picking out a human specimen and saying "you aren't flourishing" is that it is all too easy to fail to calculate (in a hedged-manner) the [[Moral Luck]] required to interpret what someone has done with what they've had. Of course, we must affirm and validate humbly.
**** What does it mean to give voice to these? We can't really know until we do. We're going to have build amplifiers for them, costly problems. 
*** https://www.wired.co.uk/article/yanis-varoufakis-bitcoin-bubble-interview
**** That piece that is missing (and, I will humbly suggest the one that [[Tapeda]] is picking out, maybe), the missing piece of the algorithm is obviously profoundly human. We each come to the table with a theory of [[The Good]], it's our plight. Even AI empowered agora, however, is fundamental in the end. What comes first? Usually, I suggest it's feeding and teaching children (especially when we cannot enjoy the fruits of our labor). 
***** We do not escape the codification of this problem just as we do not escape relying upon uncodified sources.

*** Yikes. Look, I agree that there's a fuckton of anti-chinese-propaganda (and there's a fuckton of anti-anti-chinese machinery too!). I'll agree that we're experiencing psychosis, and I'll agree that fear of average Chinese people is stupidly (outright maliciously!) misguided. Do I fear those in [[power]] in China? Yes. Do I fear those in power in other similarly powerful structures (be they nation states or transnational corporations)? Yes. China is a capitalist-run nation, and that's the only way they could compete with other capitalists that they couldn't materially revolt against otherwise. I'm a fucking tankie, but I don't think increasingly direct warfare escalations between the US and China is how we should be spending our violence (that is absurd). I think we could get along though.

*** This dude is taking some flack. I hope he's alright. His twitter inferences are too fast in some places. Interesting person. I simply don't know the level of Russian interference, but it's non-zero. Interesting [[AMA|https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/igeixp/i_am_william_binney_former_nsa_technical_director/]].

*** Yup. Not an easy topic, and this was well done. Including the quagmire of consent, there is so much tacit in knowledge, including of our relationships that I couldn't explain it to you by definition on a number of fronts (it's a really hard problem). The torrents of social dynamics that surround us form a hyperobject. The implications of what it means to be with [[The Other]] requires risk, openness, forgivenness, and [[hope]]. We're going to look stupid to most people, and that's okay. As you point out [[j3d1h]], it helps when you remember that the vast majority of people we encounter are those that don't care about us. There is a contentment to be had here, but I think you suffer greater discomforts than most simply in virtue of your sensitivity and different sensibilities.
