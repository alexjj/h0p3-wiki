title: 2022.01.25 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Gool Story

Woke at 2:30. Meow ambushed in my room. `/smh`. Meditation. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Daughter is still up at 4:30. `/smh`. Bagel, noodles, mandarins. 

A flash.

Both [[ASK]] and [[k0sh3k]] came to see me at 5:45ish. Hugs'n'bugs. Stress. Grind. It begins.

-0/+0/+1 Gobbos (thought MWC) vs Affinity. This matchup teaches us a lot. Dialectics. Feisty with mood swings, and a difficult line. [[Dune]] quotes and hugs, ofc. Unfortunately, flyers and MoE take them all down. I even kept a no-lander with a turn 4 goldfish. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Vapelyfe.

[[1uxb0x]] joined me today. Got a better look, and it's clear that our piping has been taken apart many times. What we saw was nearly unspeakable, and I am glad that I do not have much of a sense of smell. Bioslime is the only fitting word (normally, I think of tight, goo-filled canals as being pretty hawt). 

Shoveling snow and salting. Assignments.

The <<tag "Retarded Penguin Club">>convened (go team).<<ref "p">> Shopping @ Home Dept (I swear every time I go out now, I can feel myself catching covid). Unfortunately, they didn't have a tool we needed, so we had to fashion our own. A 15-foot pipe brush (with a cord attached to the piece that could fall off, just in case). We picked up another augur and foaming solution too. The cheapest Husky augur, imho, turned out better than the fancier kind, both in the mechanism and the simpler head (I don't have much experience, but I've run into enough trouble with the elaborate ones). It took a while, but we got it to our liking (I am sure it will happen again). I am glad we have 15 gallon tubs. I'm [[grateful]] that we did not have to spend a thousand dollars on a plumber. 

My son did an excellent job, above and beyond. He finished and was relieved of all other duties for the day. May he enjoy staying up late into the evening playing [[vidya]] [[games]] and chillin' with folks. He's having connectivity issues, and I think he should consider running cat5 with me for all the upstairs rooms. We all hate wireless (though, mi amor was achieving 40MB/s tonight from sftp).

Shower. Fell asleep. Not good sleep. 

She came to get me. Gave me some pills for my stomach. //Raw Skintime//. We are both disappointed by S's lie (which costs us considerably) and perplexed by SZ's reaction. We are missing another piece. Gonna slow the week down. Month has been crazy beans for her, and we're not in a rush. $600 to fill 3/4 of the oil tank; prices are up, but not wildly higher than I anticipated. Our use has been much lower than last year, and that is delightful (though, electricity is now up to $250 easy, and given the hikes and transport cost increases, it does appear that we're increasingly incentivized to give up rented-ownership of our roof). //Inform the Men!// Meditation. Gave the shower to her (though I do enjoy being there so much). 

[[TTTOTW]]. //Skintime// with [[ASK]], listening to her playlist. 

[[Family Gathering]] was dope. [[ASK]] prepared beef stew (instead of roast, and it reminded me of medieval food meets curry) + focaccia + water. The Nice Man episode of //House//. 

Daughter refuses my help. `/nod`. You got it.

[[TTTOTW]]. Put mi amor to bed. [[TTTOTW]]. Vapelyfe.

//The Walk// with [[ASK]]. Couldn't make a even a partial first route because my toes were fading into frozen. Still, glad to go. Needed.

After several hours of trial and error, saving us the time it takes to rtfm, we finally troubleshot a phone and figured out what the problem was. It won't charge unless it's plugged in.">>
