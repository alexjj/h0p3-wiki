title: 2020.07.16 - Prompted Introspection: A Good Decision

!! What is one of the best decisions you have ever made in your life?

[[2019.07.20 - Prompted Introspection: Best Decision]] can't be beat. And, of course, I won't pass up any opportunity to toot my horn and talk about all the amazing and great decisions I've made in my nearly flawless life. It's easy to reflect on the questions that tend to make us happy or feel good about ourselves. So, disclaimer aside, this is also a fine strategy in [[vidya]] [[games]]. What worked? If anything, what ought I replicate about it?

Despite some savage commentary about the people, structures, and processes, going to grad school was a great decision. I needed it, and it wasn't just the schoolwork. There were a lot of human lessons to learn. I'm a caveman emerging from the podunk dark ages. It was an understandable mistake to think I should go into academia. I am grateful that I do not have to engage in that practice, but I miss being around people who cared about the topic every day (I am lucky that my family cares enough to study with me here). 

We were pretty close to being house parents in a group home instead. Looking back, I don't know if I would have survived, and even if I did, I do not think we would have flourished. I have a hard time imagining who we would have been. I like the move we made in that case.

I feel like going again would be a waste. I do hope to help my offspring through whatever schooling they have. I could see myself being the weird dad who learns the content with them (or tries, probably fails, lol).
