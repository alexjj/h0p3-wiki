title: 2020.09.10 - Wiki Review: Assemblagical Block of Becoming Qua Non-Prime Opaque Fractally-Nested Elements In Everchanging Relation
type: 

* [[2020.09.09 - Sphygmus: Gotchu Fam]]
** I have been thinking about what it will be like to meet her offline. It's so wildly different feeling than meeting any other person I've met offline for the first time.
* [[2020.09.09 - Prompted Introspection: Still Lost]]
** The math is obvious though.
* [[2020.09.09 - Wiki Review: Wrestling]]
** If I had it to do all over again, we'd have been journaling from the beginning. It's not like we haven't had journals, but I didn't enforce it. I didn't make it an ingrained habit. Most do not have the innate desire.
* [[2020.09.09 - TDL: Increase Value Of Cum On The NY Cock Exchange]]
** They don't want my help. Watching them drown in the whirlwind too. =/.
* [[2020.09.09 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Uncertainty]]
** GPS coordinates might not work. US Military can just shut it down. Still, it may have merit.
* [[2020.08.31 - Sphygmus: Gently & Patiently Together]]
** I should have asked if she got quarters. I ended up getting $2 bills (and interesting mechanic to incentivize saving).
* [[2020.09.22 - Sphygmus: I Love You]]
** She has a surprising amount of knowledge about spiders too. 
*** I wonder if she would grade her memory as being more than two standard deviations above average. I'd bet on it.
**** Also, ultra-intentional.
*** Reminds me that I adore robots and scarabs. Got that magic meets technology thing.
** Do I think it will be awkward to meet her? I think I might cry, and she's gonna be annoyed that I hold her too long on the hug. I think she'll enjoy being on her laptop with us eating food listening to music, maybe a game, and I think she'll feel comfortable there. She already knows I'm a lunatic and a dog, lol.   
* [[2020.08.19 - Sphygmus: Autism]]
** Discord is among one of the easiest tools for connecting. Only Reddit seems to be easier here. There are rare exceptions in chat client usage for me at this point.
** Yeah, she might be on the spectrum. 
** Still thinking about the echoes of this one.
* [[2020.08.18 - Sphygmus: The Quotes]]
** I'm still not sure how I want to do the [[Recent]]ly edited changelog/commentary. 
** Reminds me of web-bundles consideration.
** I wonder if she would want to do [[???]]. It's kinda dumb, lol. Random. I don't RP correctly.
** Seems to me like she has to budget her images so hard. I can see why she's gotta find the hacks.
* [[2020.08.05 - Sphygmus: Dreaming Of Walking With Her]]
** I could see her 20 years from now being quite social on her trails. Plus, who would know the trails better?
** If we get this stars-aligned house, it would be within walking distance of the trail still (though, it's not clear if we'll be able to walk there so easily just yet). She gonna have to slow down for the fat man, lol.
** We are letterers. =D. 
*** Lettererestness, Letterericity, Lettererological. 
* [[2020.08.03 - Sphygmus: Fidgets & Stimming]]
** Regen "peeling plastic off electronics, glass, and steel" feeling. Needs that sound and that delicious rumble feel.
** I will eat some scabs. I am particularly fond of the very thick skin that can peel off the heel of my foot; I will chew it like chewing gum.
* [[2020.07.31 - Sphygmus: 2-in-1]]
** She may end up even personally living in all the major OS ecosystems. Probably the necessary thing to do.
** I've recently been able to see a lot more of the pictures she's taken. I can imagine she's been around the block here.
* [[2020.07.23 - Sphygmus: #tru-ricers]]
** I like how she doesn't give up on me for all the errors I've got. Everyone else is like: "Naw, that [[h0p3]] feller has too many mistakes to address."
** I am envious of how cool her friends from college were and are. I am lucky to speak with mine these years later, but it's different for me.
** I can imagine that moving to a 4k screen in Linux might require a lot of work.
*** This reminds me of the reasons I shouldn't attempt the Pinephone. I don't have the heart for it anymore.
** I'm interested to see where she goes in computing.   
* [[2020.07.16 - Sphygmus: Slightly Alternative Universe]]
** Totally surprised. Makes no fucking sense to me, lol.
*** I'm not pursuing this because I'm worried it's both too painful and unproductive (though I may be way off base). 
**** It's weird to me. Normally, I wouldn't hesitate to pull the trigger on my questions.
** I wish she got to rice and design interfaces more at her job. She gotta do what she gotta do, and a job is a job, I realize.
*** I can't see her nearly as well as she can see me. I imagine she's someone who knows how to not give a fuck about making something look pretty (e.g. "fuck that pile of laundry") while also having sections of her life, not just her technology and her art, that are riced to taste.
** I hope I can remember to have Reese's available for her when she visits.  
* [[2020.07.11 - Sphygmus: Redaction]]
** She is graceful yet again with my failure to interpret.
** Hrm. Reminds me of [[Sharing]] quotes. 
** It's so fascinatingly weird to have read and thought about her so much without ever having even heard her voice.
*** My accents wiggle a lot, mold into the sitcheeayshun. I wonder if hers does. 
** My brain isn't looking for the collisions. It's like grammar errors: I don't see them! Maybe I need to step through links to force myself to verify. Should happen in a text editor, probably.
** I'm reminded of the difficulties the [[PSM]]ers appear to experience in speaking with each other, or it might just be me. I'm so not used to having a [[hyperconversation]] like this.
*** I don't want to argue about this point either unless I'm asked, lol. The problem is that if I'm not going to argue (or walk down paths that lead to argumentation), then I have very little to say.  
* [[2020.09.04 - Sho: Recuperatin']]
** Music & [[k0sh3k]] seem to be the remaining thread.
* [[2020.08.28 - Sho: Sleep Is Such A Cunt]]
** She probably has to get used to listening to his music quite a bit. I do not enjoy listening to people practice music at length (especially not when practicing is done well). 
* [[2020.08.02 - Sho: New Phone]]
** Her husband must be fairly talented. They seem to be inching into the celebrity world.
* [[2020.07.15 - Sho: Heilung]]
** Oh yeah, need to hook them up. 
* [[2020.09.04 - MWGhandi: Ear Infection]]
** This is where we start to drop off.
* [[2020.08.30 - MWGhandi: Trying Not To Rely On Anyone]]
** I know that feeling. =/. I want to make sure she's got the right amount of space.
* [[2020.08.21 - MWGhandi: Finding Her People]]
** Missionary kids have seen some shit. I've never met a "normal" one. Perhaps it's a point we will connect on later. It may only get worse with time for her.
* [[2020.08.21 - MWGhandi: Got The Job]]
** It's a relief to know she's got the basics covered.
* [[2020.07.31 - MWGhandi: Peering & Hendrix]]
** I keep running into this problem. There's other prices to pay if you want me to be your dad rather than a peer (even though I am slow to call anyone my peer in many contexts). Still, I'll be as useful a friend as I know how, and I do that knowing people aren't going to be able to repay me. 
*** It is better that I fade into the background.
* [[2020.07.24 - MWGhandi: Thoughtful Wounded Animal]]
** I feel bad for the nannies I know. I think that must make it way more complicated to think about having ones own offspring too.
** Wealthy, educated, techbro Indian men. Got it. I think she should chop the wealthy part off at the very least. But, I can appreciate her position. 
* [[2020.07.17 - MWGhandi: Thinking About School]]
** That was surprising. I have no idea if my offspring will find it useful to speak with others about their upbringing. I hope so. 
* [[2020.08.28 - L: No One Should Be Okay]]
** Yup. God, I am such a pain in the ass. It's my job.
* [[2020.08.14 - L: Listless Puttering & Bitrunning]]
** I hope she's continued to journal. 
*** I can appreciate going absolutely private with it, ofc. Even sharing it with me is expensive.
** That probably isn't going away. I've said it clearly as I know how.
* [[2020.07.29 - L: Hellhole]]
** //pst//, I do [[aim]] to be patient.
* [[2020.07.17 - L: The Cost of Giving]]
** Lost cause at this point? I've said what I need to say. 
* [[2020.09.07 - K: Everyone Is Behind]]
** Pst. You should aim for a much richer autobiography. Increasing the consciousness of proletariat requires it! That level of awareness of ones stories and storytelling is what you have to bring out in your children, [[WINTCIS]]. 
** I think I'm exceptionally lucky to have multiple people who would even attempt to spend 10% as much effort as I have in wrestling with my stories. That's rare, a gift.
* [[2020.08.28 - K: Educational Autobiography]]
** He's got a balance that going to allow him to pass. I think it's still a mistake how it is structured, but this one is not up to me.
*** I appreciate the desire to play games. I do. Welp, at least it gives us something to talk about. Epistemic cred in gaming might transfer in some cases.
* [[2020.08.26 - K: This Is Our World Now]]
** I will continue to make the argument. It's my job.
* [[2020.08.21 - K: Stretched...Well]]
** I could see versions of myself going down the painting road. I'm not convinced it's the the fitting use of my time though. 
* [[2020.08.13 - K: Blank Orientation]]
** When yours masters is fundamentally easier than your bachelors (not a motivation issue), there's something wrong. May he have all he needs to signal to get where he can do the actual work. 
* [[2020.08.11 - K: School Books]]
** It should fucking bother you that it is remote! 
*** I get it though. I think it is more of a piece of paper anyway. Self-teaching is the route to go.
** I wish he'd be more interested in pirating himself. Not all students are prepared for pirating, but some benefit from it. 
* [[2020.08.07 - K: Gift of the Flood]]
** I wish I knew how to warn teachers more effectively. I want him to be more than a babysitter.
* [[2020.07.24 - K: Hybrid]]
** I think he's been stabilizing. I see him positioning more and coming to terms. 
** He's been a father (even if not in name) for so long. It has hindered his development in many respects, and I don't hold him responsible for that. He's a man of honor to me. He serves [[others]].
* [[2020.07.17 - K: Bringing It Out]]
** He's a man with his plate fairly full (though he gets major playtime in). I hope he'll be there for his siblings. He might be their only source of sanity. I can appreciate the weight of it, the need for escape, and the recognition that so little is up to him. I meet a lot of incredibly selfish people (that's most people I know), and there's something to be said for how he doesn't empathize with himself, but he's a [[gem]]. The man fucking throws down.
