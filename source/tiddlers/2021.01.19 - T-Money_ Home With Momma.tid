Fixing up the house.

How about you?
Jan 19 11:43pm
Like your profile pic, btw.
Jan 19 11:43pm
Fixing it up to sell or just fixing stuff?
Jan 19 11:43pm
Just making it home for us.
Jan 19 11:43pm
I'm Juggling a ton of bricks over here. Life threw me some curve balls already in 2021
Jan 19 11:44pm
My Mom has pancost tumor in her lung.
Jan 19 11:44pm
Oh shit.
Jan 19 11:45pm
So I put in one week notice. Said peace out to my job. And I'm gonna to be with my momma.
Jan 19 11:45pm
Yes, sir.
Jan 19 11:45pm
Don't know full prognosis yet. Could. Be alot of time. Could Be a little time. But time is limited.
Jan 19 11:46pm
Yes, sir. I'm sorry to hear that.
Jan 19 11:46pm
Thank you I appriciate it.
Jan 19 11:46pm
We both know this is what life has in store for all of us. In some fashion.
Jan 19 11:47pm
I'm staying positive. And so is mom.
Jan 19 11:47pm
I asked her if she was gonna quit smoking. And she said. 'Well, I got one more carton (not pack! Carton!) and then I think I'm done. " lol
Jan 19 11:48pm
lol
Jan 19 11:48pm
She's a registered nursefor 40+ years. She is more prepared for death than any of us.
Jan 19 11:48pm
But I started smoking weed again. Haha. Friday was my last day. So.
Jan 19 11:50pm
It's not as amazing as I remembered it. Defiantly doesn't numb your brain enough.
Jan 19 11:50pm
Ha. I hear that.
Jan 19 11:51pm
It's legal up there isn't it?
Jan 19 11:51pm
I'm really glad that you get smoke. You think your mom might smoke with ya? I really enjoy getting high with family.
Jan 19 11:51pm
Medicinally, yes.
Jan 19 11:51pm
I've actually stopped using cannabis recently and switched to delta 8.
Jan 19 11:52pm
Insanely cheap.
Jan 19 11:52pm
Quite possibly. But more likely in edible form
Jan 19 11:52pm
Wtf is delta 8. Gotta go Google. BRB. Lol

Jan 19 11:54pm
Quarter a million people saw my ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî± this week.
Jan 19 11:55pm
Fuck yeah man. That's impressive. Getting slot more traffic to your wiki?
Jan 19 11:57pm
No idea. I keep zero records, no analytics.
Jan 19 11:57pm
Have 4chan RSSed to respond on the fly, but no takers thus far.
Jan 19 11:57pm
Watching video now. Had to research and read your delta 8 post.
Jan 19 11:59pm

It might be weak for ya. I don't hit it hard. Though, it had LSD/Ketamine like effects at a high dose. Extremely strong visuals (different from extremely high cannabis doses where text becomes a blur for me).
Jan 20 12:00am
It's so cheap you can take as much as you want though.
Jan 20 12:01am
I'm still just old fashioned smoking so I have no idea extreme high cannabis. Never dabbed. My edibiles were old school made. And never had a vap cartridge if thc
Jan 20 12:02am
This is worth your time and money: https://philosopher.life/#Product%20Review%3A%20Plenty%20Vape
Jan 20 12:03am
Makes your flower go far.
Jan 20 12:03am
I'm still watching dude in your rabbit hole.
Jan 20 12:07am
gay
Jan 20 12:07am
ü§£
Jan 20 12:08am
Too bad he didn't dive further into your wiki.
Jan 20 12:13am
He can't read. It's okay. Lol.
Jan 20 12:13am
I've reached out to him. We'll see.
Jan 20 12:13am
I can't read half your shit. Lol. I'm OK with 3rd grade level and $3 words. Lol
Jan 20 12:14am
That vaporizer looks intimidating.
Jan 20 12:16am
It's not. You'll love it too.
Jan 20 12:16am
A lot is lost in combustion (including the vapes the kids use).
Jan 20 12:17am
Can buy a pound of 15% CBD hemp trim (probably 5%) for $50, shipped to one's house.
Jan 20 12:18am
Might be better to just make edibles with that though
Jan 20 12:18am
I'm just buying old fashion buds and using a pipe and lighter.
Jan 20 12:20am
Call. Me. Old school.
Jan 20 12:20am
Will do
Jan 20 12:20am
I'm a pansy. Smoking doesn't work for me.
Jan 20 12:20am
Although I am getting a half Oz in a couple of days. Was considering making oil or butter so I csn consume it easier. But I'm afraid of thc loss or ruining my money
Jan 20 12:21am
Not sure if that type of consumption is as good as smoking it.
Jan 20 12:22am
wildly more price-efficient to make the edible
Jan 20 12:22am
Combustion wastes so much product
Jan 20 12:23am
I STILL have cannabutter from my last batch I made 5 years ago
Jan 20 12:23am
https://philosopher.life/#Recipe%3A%20Cannabutter
Jan 20 12:23am
I would make an oil instead. More portable in the end.
Jan 20 12:24am
Butter seems really inconspicuous.
Jan 20 12:26am
It's not. It's green, and it smells like skunk.
Jan 20 12:26am
Oh. So. Oil then. It stinks?
Jan 20 12:27am
Any of the methods available to us to extract the cannabinoids will still have at least some of the odor.
Jan 20 12:28am
I can hunt for more options, but some of that shit is too fancy for my taste.
Jan 20 12:29am
How's your wife and daughter doing?
Jan 20 12:33am
They are good. Kid is in school. For now. Not sure how  long that is gonna last. But she really needs it.
Jan 20 12:36am
Alot of kids are suffering anxiety due to the covid shit.
Jan 20 12:37am
Yeah. =/
Jan 20 12:38am
How about your wife and kiddos?
Jan 20 12:39am
My offspring are not living up to my standard, but they live up to my wife's. I do my best to leave them alone, lol.
Jan 20 12:39am
Wife had a much needed 2 week break. Back to the grind.
Jan 20 12:40am
I'm trying to connect with my kiddo. But seems like we are still hitting in different directions. She still likes to hug on me. And sometimes rest on me. Which is nice.
Jan 20 12:42am
They turn into little animals.
Jan 20 12:43am
Lop
Jan 20 12:43am
Lol*
Jan 20 12:43am
I've been wrestling (arguing) hardcore with [[j3d1h]] a lot. Doing what I can to hand her autonomy as fast as I safely can.
Jan 20 12:44am
I am glad we still eat meals together. That's a time to just be.
Jan 20 12:44am
I did have one day recently where I we couldn't even be in the same room for the meal.
Jan 20 12:45am
It sucked.
Jan 20 12:45am
Like having my heart torn out.
Jan 20 12:45am
*canm
Jan 20 12:45am
can't* say I've been emotionally stable enough; it's been an odd year
Jan 20 12:46am
even for me
Jan 20 12:46am
We have our screaming matches. She has alot of attitude. It can be rough.
Jan 20 12:47am
I ain't been very stable either. But I'm still here. So I guess that counts.
Jan 20 12:47am
Yes, sir. Doin what we can.
Jan 20 12:48am
I mean. I think we can count it. Lol
Jan 20 12:48am
One day I hope. Mine never feels the same way about life as I do. Haha
