Going Stale: tip is to buy TIPS and short nominal treasuries if you think inflation will still be astronomical going forward (e.g. if you think Head & Shoulders is gonna cost an arm and a leg)

<br>

as a true believer in the efficient society hypothesis, which is to say policy reflects all knowledge, including having priced in all anticipated future risks, there's nothing more to do. it's out of my hands into the invisible hand of the great capitalism daddy who already both knew i was going to say [[this sentence|ITS]] and has taken those signals into account in the construction of the most efficient centralization of [[power]] of society, and surely it will be my turn to be at the top of that pyramid some day (i bow before this god in the belief that others will bow before me)

Neokeynesian praxis privatizes monetary policy, solidifying control of the market not merely through the control of monetary policy, but by collapsing the two in an efficient demonstration of how economics is always a subset of politics.

Tell me again how overleveraged multi-ordered synthetic derivatives ~~markets~~ casinos with shells aren't a form of shadowbanking, please. 

<br>

Imagine usury, shadowbanking, and the pursuit of competitive advantages through increasingly leveraged gambling bringing about a state of affairs wherein a third of publicly traded companies in the US do not earn enough to make their interest payments. Waves of zombies crawl inside the bubble. MMT's conception of velocity and liquidity are actually concerned with consolidating [[power]] into the hands of financiers while treading water as the jaws of contradiction tears through it all. I do not see how capitalists qua the Fed will not print their way out of this problem either.
