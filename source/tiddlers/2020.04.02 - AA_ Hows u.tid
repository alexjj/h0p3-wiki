How's your week going?
Apr 2 9:51pm
Its ok —chicken coop defeat today but tomorrow is a new day —I have a plan
Apr 2 9:52pm
The baby chicks are good —we lost one on Monday but the rest are growing
Apr 2 9:52pm
Hows u
Apr 2 9:53pm
=(
Apr 2 9:53pm
I'm glad they others are growing big and strong.
Apr 2 9:53pm
I hope the coop goes well. Hard to put it all together fast, I assume.
Apr 2 9:54pm
I'm doing well. I have too much to do, not enough hours in the day. I need 40 hour days.
Apr 2 9:54pm
She developed wry neck —its a genetic vitamin def —Since then I have gotten some vitamins to add to their water
Apr 2 9:54pm
The coop is fine —I need to make a level spot to put it together
Apr 2 9:55pm
And brackets are better for me than trying to “toe nail” ?

Apr 2 9:55pm
40 hour days sound good and bad depending on the day
Apr 2 9:55pm
I bet you'll get better results with brackets.
Apr 2 9:56pm
Yeah
Apr 2 9:57pm
The perfect level —love it!
Apr 2 9:57pm
I also got a remnant of vinyl flooring—I read that it would make it easier to clean
Apr 2 9:57pm
ahhh
Apr 2 9:59pm
Yeah, that seems like it would help
Apr 2 9:59pm
Got a 3 x 12 piece —think that will work
Apr 2 9:59pm
Got to do some dungeons with [[K]] 😊. That was very fun.

Got two walls up
Apr 6 1:39pm

Apr 6 1:39pm
And a vinyl floor
Apr 6 1:39pm
For easy cleaning
Apr 6 1:39pm
Aye. Gonna be a fancy coop, lol.
Apr 6 1:39pm

Apr 6 1:39pm
Chickens are growing and doing well
Apr 6 1:40pm
Right now I am working on google classroom lessons!
Apr 6 1:40pm
Nifty.
Apr 6 1:40pm
One of those things you hope you never have to use again, but nice to have the back pocket for later.
Apr 6 1:41pm
Yeah —The introvert in me is ok with this...
Apr 6 1:41pm
