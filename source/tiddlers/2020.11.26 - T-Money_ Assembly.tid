I agree with the sentiment "No one's going to tell you how many people you can have for Thanksgiving dinner."

I agree that one ought not have many people over for Thanksgiving, but this is a place the government may not regulate. French Revolutions are proof of this.

And, I say that as someone who agrees that we can meet just fine over our machines.

This is a freedom of assembly problem.

Reading "V for Vendetta," and the abuse of quarantine to attack the political rights to freedom of assembly is in the opening pages too.

I expect some federal mandates on assembly, masks, and cerfews in January after Biden takes office.
