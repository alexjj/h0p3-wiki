!! Do you ever enjoy the experience of emotional pain?

Pain is not an easy word to define. It's not clear to me what pain isn't emotional to some [[dok]], and, similarly, it's difficult to speak of what is standardly conceived of as emotional pain that doesn't have other physiological manifestations (it physically hurts too, often distributed over larger timeslices as well). 

I can enjoy parts of what causes that pain. This is attached or indirect, but I can't say that the emotional pain itself is a source of enjoyment, at least not at the time. I can enjoy that I've experienced such pain in various respects. I don't understand the enjoyment of pain very well. There's something to be said for resilience, integrity, and endurance; these pick out some secondary effects of pain, what it means, what it entails, and so on. Insofar as that pain can be useful, there's reason to have positive emotions and reasons about it, even if "enjoyment" might not be the most fitting term. Again, it's not the experience of the emotional pain that I'd claim to be enjoying.
