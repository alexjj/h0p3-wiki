* [[2020.10.19 - Link Log: Do More Work 2 Interoperate With Fewer People]]
** Reached out to both desolhar and urbit-fan fossuser (unfortunately, Palantir...so it may just be wrestling). 
** My daughter has been studying ancient Chinese history. I hope she'll think about that piece on modern India.

** I've not been exercising enough. 
*** Cmon, dude.
** I'm worried about our vehicles now. =/. Have an inspection, and I don't know if they'll let it pass because the light is on (even though it shouldn't be a problem).

** Completed. When I'm not perfectionistic about it, I'm also attention-whore greedy and quick to cross boundaries in relationships. I don't think most conventions can be justified.

** Completed. I wonder if it is a form of masochism.

** Lmao. I probably shouldn't, but I find it an annoying question. When I do, I answer it brazenly these days. I'm studying it all (poorly), but most really mean for me to pick out where I am willing to take a stand.
*** I realize it's a fine question. I've gotta put some tentpegs down for us to grapple with. It provides desperately needed context in an elevator speech. I want the same information from everyone, lol.

** The historical figure is quite the badass.
