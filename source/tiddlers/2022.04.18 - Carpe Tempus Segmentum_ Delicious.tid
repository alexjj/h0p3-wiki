title: 2022.04.18 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Delicious

<<<
I don't even remember. I know it was good.

[[Family Time]] @ 3? Stupidly fast. Pleasant too.

Mi amor made delicious whole chickens and salad for dinner. They were demolished in short order (I'm in lurv with that wing sauce). Also, muhfuckin' cheesecake and apple pie for mi amor. Happy Easter, bitches.

//Big Fish//. [[TTTOTW]]. Fell asleep. I don't remember what time...

//Skintime// with my sympaticon. Mi amor lost her phone, helped her find it. Chilled with her and put her to bed. //Community//. Sleep by 11? 
<<<

Woke at 10. Actually woke many times before then, but just dozed off again instead. Dreams, rich as they come. Didn't want to leave. Feel like I caught up on sleep too. //Skintime// with my sympaticon + planning + [[Morning Routine]]. 

Hugs'n'bugs. Offspring in a good mood, and `/gasp`, on task. wat. A partial run in [[D2]] to test [[hope]] (the Assassin's) viability on p8 runs. She died, there's too many close calls, and she can't keep her merc alive either. Holy freeze buys enough time, but I have to find a replacement for the curse. I will be Mind Blasting Lister's wave. Hard to see her really edging out the Smitezealer (Mr. Nog, as it were). 

[[Garden]]ing with my sympaticon. Assignments. [[j3d1h]] is unhappy. Deliver, render, fulfill the deal, and you won't have to deal with me nearly at all. Simple. More planning.

Chitchat on Libertarianism with [[Aether]]ians. Summoned from 4chan. `/wave`, hi [[anon]]s.

[[D2]] was almost a waste, but Twerk found another Gul. [[TTTOTW]].

Dadnap.

Met with X. He made his pitch, and we hurried him along through his rhetoric. He was clearly nervous and yet overconfident at the same time. He knew what he was doing. So far, Mitch's second pitch is in the lead.

My offspring were late again, despite the daggers of "there's no way it will happen again." Bounced between the RP party in the kitchen and mi amor. One run in [[D2]] before we were called up.

[[Family Gathering]] was dope. Fish'n'chips + salad a la my offspring. We weren't able to have the tartar sauce test ([[YSB]]). Watched the suicidal author episode of //House//. [[TTTOTW]].

[[D2]]. Lem and Fal. NeckRomancer is 90, hope 85 (and, apparently, if I decide to play correctly, it's smooth enough sailing). Infinity would be dope here. I'm having a hard time justifying anything except the Pally to 99 though.
