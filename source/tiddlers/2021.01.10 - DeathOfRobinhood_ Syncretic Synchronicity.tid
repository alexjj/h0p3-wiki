I'd always wondered that you never made any references to Langan on your wiki
Jan 1 12:24pm
As nuts and inscrutable a lot of what he said was to me, it did seem like he articulated ideas that would find parallels to your way of thinking
Jan 1 12:25pm
So it's a funny synchronism that you'd link to him just on he eve of this obscure conversation releasing
Jan 1 12:26pm
Also, Bonne année!
Jan 1 12:26pm
=). Happy New Year, sir!
Jan 1 3:24pm
That is a timely video. Thank you.
Jan 1 3:43pm
Halfway through, Kal Rivet's perspective is my favorite in the video.

I'd like to relisten to pick out what resonates with you. I contacted him about his podcast. On Spotify. "Univeralism Against the World"
Jan 1 4:46pm

Sounds like a fascinating person to get to know. Are you enjoying the podcast?
Jan 3 11:20pm
I'm not sure how much it resonated with me, but I'm glad to think about it. If you pick out the timestamps for me, I'll look for resonance there.
Jan 3 11:20pm

I appreciate that. I've been listening to his podcast slowly, somewhat casually.

If I knew these people to any degree, I might be more eager to press a connection, but I only suggested the video because I don't see people considering Langan very often, and when I saw two consecutive mentions, I thought I'd try to see if the stars would produce anything of value. It was a low stakes, low expectations recommend
Jan 4 12:08am
Yes, sir. `/salute`. I appreciate it. That makes good sense to me.

Hey, how are you?
Jan 10 6:46pm
I'm hanging in there. Enjoying the hiki life in many respects.
Jan 10 6:47pm
How about you?
Jan 10 6:47pm
Processing. Things are good, but I need to consider how I say and do unhelpful things
Jan 10 6:49pm
Do you have time to chat a bit tonight?
Jan 10 6:49pm
Yeah, that'd be dope.
