!! Audit:

* This log is significantly easier with new questions. The novelty is fun, and I'm not required to engage the same degree of historical coherence compute and [[audit]]ing.
* Have these logs reached a point where one must be fluent in my grogginese to understand them well enough?
* Everyone thinks I should never fucking writing a children's book. =(. 
** That's probably right. I enjoyed that prompt though!
* Extremely re-readable for me, especially since they are new questions. It's not vanilla to me.
* I'm at the point where I'm not sure [[audit]]s are necessary here, but I think it's still low-enough hanging fruit to try.
* One thing I like to do is ask: what if this wiki were //just// composed of this one log? [[Link Log]], for example, is pretty fabulous to me. I would cum rainbows to find anyone else that overlapped enough. I think this log could stand alone really well too. Yet, it also provides a serious hyperlink window into the rest of the wiki too. It's a binding agent too.
