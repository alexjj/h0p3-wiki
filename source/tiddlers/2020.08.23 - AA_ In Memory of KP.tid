How's it going?
Aug 21 5:01pm

Running around but glad to be past the first week classes start tomorrow for masters
Aug 23 8:35pm
And we have eggs!
Aug 23 8:35pm
First week hurdles down, second week to go! Cool.
Aug 23 10:48pm
That is awesome, btw.
Aug 23 10:49pm
Reminds me of something else, I had a person in my life, her name was Karen Prince, and she would make egg sculptures.
Aug 23 10:50pm
How do you like your eggs made?
Aug 23 10:50pm
Over medium or scrambled
Aug 23 10:50pm
Me too.
Aug 23 10:51pm
I think I am gonna make some sausage egg muffins for the week

Dope.
Aug 23 10:52pm
We have two walmart bags of tomatoes and a few peppers...one pepper is purple!
Aug 23 10:52pm
How’s everything there?
Aug 23 10:55pm
Looking at Purple peppers on le google. I don't think I've seen one before.
Aug 23 10:56pm
I had a seed mixture of peppers —didn’t expect purple
Aug 23 10:56pm
We are acceptable. Ups and downs. I've cried a lot this week, but life is good.
Aug 23 10:57pm
Crying is a good release sometimes—I struggle to allow it
Aug 23 10:58pm
Hope everyone is well —what is Yale doing in this covid mess?
Aug 23 10:58pm
It has been a valuable use of my time.
Aug 23 10:59pm
Yale has been planning. The structure is larger than I can see. I see a great deal of competition among the stakeholders. They are opening in stages and the rules appear vetted in such a way to make to easy to shut down layers of school given threshold infection rates (they have so much money, that they might be able to hack their way through a number of problems). There's a difference among the schools inside Yale, and differences in those departments too. The divinity school might be separate enough that they will have some autonomy over having student workers, their own public computers, rooms to study in, etc. People are being prepared for remote.
Aug 23 11:03pm
I think there is a non-trivial chance it will go largely remote within a month.
Aug 23 11:05pm
Yeah we think our public schools will too
Aug 23 11:06pm
Aye. It may be the case.
Aug 23 11:06pm
I'm too blind here.
Aug 23 11:06pm
Our admin thinks that most of it is political motivated and by Dec we will either have a vaccine or the hype will be over after the election
Aug 23 11:07pm
I am not sure I agree but I can’t see how our measures inside school are preventative enough
Aug 23 11:08pm
I think that many of us had the virus before March...
Aug 23 11:09pm
I am worried for you. I know you go into harms way, and I do not claim it is right.
Aug 23 11:09pm
I suggest the possibility that the very bad illness I had in January might have been it.
Aug 23 11:09pm
I should have gone to the hospital, but we didn't have insurance.
Aug 23 11:09pm
Cleared up by the time I went.
Aug 23 11:10pm
Hopefully, you've already had it.
Aug 23 11:10pm
We had something in the late Fall that was “sinus-related” and tons of kids were out
Aug 23 11:10pm
But they weren’t positive for flu...
Aug 23 11:11pm
Could be that we brought it —I hope not.
Aug 23 11:11pm
I am constantly wiping down things and desks and doors at school —we are trying to keep the kids in the same room and move the teachers
Aug 23 11:15pm
I do not deny that the timing is interesting. I try to read many places, and I hear many whispers. I don't know when a vaccine will be available. I think the economic impact is the much larger problem, and I say that knowing the catastrophic loss of life due to CV19.
Aug 23 11:15pm
[[JRE]]'s nursery couldn't keep open for more than two weeks because the regulations could not be met. I know you do everything you can. I don't know how to open perfectly at that scale (despite thinking about it with [[k0sh3k]] who has been crafting policy at a breakneck speed with ridiculous resources).
Aug 23 11:18pm
It's gonna be a school year to remember.
Aug 23 11:19pm
That is definitely true
