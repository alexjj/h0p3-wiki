title: 2020.08.07 - Prompted Introspection: One Of

!! What's something you wish you had at least one of, if not exactly one of?

Yes, yes, [[2020.01.10 - Prompted Introspection: Cuz]], that is correct. Now, enjoy less categorical {[[dream]]}ing. I'd like to narrow the hunt down to something practical. My list could be endless and for things too tall. I want a phone that I own. I want a very long-battery life (which requires enormous software tuning), a reasonable touch interface, and I want to actually finally enjoy using this device I've hated from the beginning. I think I have to continue to wait for something like the Pinephone folks to deliver a non-dev piece of hardware or a GPD with sim. I've wanted such a thing for a long time, and I can't say I'll ever be able to have one. It would be dope though.
