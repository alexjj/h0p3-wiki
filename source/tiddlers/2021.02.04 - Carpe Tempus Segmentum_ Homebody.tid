title: 2021.02.04 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Homebody

* Internet connection went down for an hour.
* Chilled with bro, he was still up. 
* Bro told me he was tired of trip...K don't last that long. He didn't mention until later that he had also added Δ⁸. That makes sense now.
** He was feeling extra anxious. Calmed him down, hugs, tucked him in. 
* Try To Take Over The World
* Salad, Tendies, Water, LoL
* Sleep by 5
* Woke at 10
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Bugged offspring
** Daughter isn't being honest with herself. `/sigh`. My job to show her the truth. Painful AF.
* [[MTG]] with daughter
** Her Affinity vs Shitfinity 0/+3, 1/+1, -0: Lack of aggression from her. Classic her.
* [[MTG]] with son
** His Affinity +1, 0/+1, 0 vs Dredge. Plenty to discuss. He took the match, and I didn't mull hard enough. 
** A chance to talk about real shit. I suppose it's like playing catch. It's not up to me if he succeeds by and large now. I continue to create distance between me and almost everyone. 
* Charging lanterns
* Cleaning. Sense of ownership helps, as usual.
* Sleep. Hard sleep. Endless dreams.
* Bugged offspring
** Killing me. Proof of my failure as a dad, yet again (even if it isn't a moral one).
* Wife looked exhausted. She basically offered, and I turned her down. Instead, a massage.
** Also, she laughed because I was right again. Redtide. It's her inferences and mood. Just doesn't feel normal to me. I like that I know before she does (and it's body, lmao). 
** Used lube (and spit ;P) + elbows. Cracked that back awesomely too. She told me about her day, and I wore it out of her.
* Shower of the gods!
** New head is amazing. Feels like those wire head massagers that are so powerful I involuntarily curl and giggle on (or almost cum, either way). Gonna have to find a different mount point for the hanging shelf. 
*** Someone promised to use it for its most important* purpose. <3.
** Dehumidification option still not found. 
* Bro was teaching my offspring how to make food.
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Everyone got their own. I had hummus, veggies, some cheese.
** Dominion. Wife took us down by 2 points. 
* Fireman Time!
* Try To Take Over The World
* Daughter up late half-working on her machine. Let her stay up later for working toward doing the right thing.
* [[MTG]] with bro. His idea, his picks.
** His Dredge vs D&T, then Affinity. Rapid introductions, open hands, set him up to practice goldfishing. Now that is a deck worth mastering for our table. 
*** It was an opportunity to show my brother that explaining what I understand doesn't necessarily annoy me. I recognize that sometimes we have an avoidance here.
** Hopefully, he'll have a deck to play with the young ones. Bond.
* Try To Take Over The World

Excepting /u/Remarkable_Duck6559, it was a fairly quiet day, almost fully hiki. There's going to be stretches like that, I think. Perhaps as I curl-up, it will be that way for a long time. I think there's a hardening that comes with being a 4eak 4 lyfe. Still, there is [[hope]]. I got some dancing in today too.
