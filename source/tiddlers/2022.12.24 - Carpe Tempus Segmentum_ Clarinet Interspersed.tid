title: 2022.12.24 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Clarinet Interspersed

Woke at 7:30? Susan called. I can't tell if she had a wrong number (same name) or took me to be an ex-boyfriend of hers. We talked for 5 minutes, and she was apologizing for her alcoholism. Once I offered to come over and help her get through the paperwork to get her pension from the state prison system, she seemed to recognize me. Surprised. Told me to come over to get some kneepads she had for me some time. Tried to sleep again, but not sure if I did. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. ⁸Δ⁸.

[[5c0ut]]'s biscotti is good. Gettin' high on the holidays. //Skintime// with mi amor. Made baguette with liver, creamcheese, onions galore, and more. Mandarin and Ginger ale too. //Pontypool// with my sympaticon + [[TTTOTW]]. Charged my clarinet for the second time (was at 20%). 

Dadnap. Assignments. Hugs'n'bugs. Put mi amor to bed. Her reading day has been dope. Nothing but books, few snacks, relax.

//Skintime// + //Pontypool// with my sympaticon. Movie was good. Squint and giggle where appropriate. It got after it. Yes, it did. 

[[TTTOTW]], and a lot of [[vidya]]s covered. Made quesadillas. Lots of folks in the kitchen. I have been overruled. We are watching an unfortunate tradition to make up for [[E.T.]], which at least almost nobody thought was worthwhile. Philistines. I need to get better at finding what they will like.

[[Family Gathering]] wasn't bad. [[TTTOTW]] + //A Nightmare Before Christmas//.

//Skintime// with my amor. She toast. Put folks to bed. Sleep by 10?
