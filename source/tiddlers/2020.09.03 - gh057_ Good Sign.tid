Doing good. How you guys found doing?
Fri 10:18am
The kids are doing well. So, I say good. =)
Fri 10:19am
How about your family?
Fri 10:19am

`/high-5`
Fri 10:21am
How's wire work? What's the school situation feeling like?
Fri 10:21am
üëçI cant make enough strings right now. Good and bad problem. 
School is weird. Kinda desolate.  Starting 50% per day on Tuesday. And Carter Cares starts too.
Fri 10:23am
I hope they are treatin' you right. I can imagine it's a hustle if you can't make enough. Nice to have the job security.
Fri 10:25am
That must be a super weird feeling at school.
Fri 10:25am
They were doing 25% per day before?
Fri 10:25am
They are truly the same. No leadership. 
Its kinda strange and sad. 
Yes 25%.
Fri 10:26am
Moving to 50% is a good sign, I take it.
Fri 10:26am
Yes i think so. We will see if the virus numbers stays down. I dunno.
