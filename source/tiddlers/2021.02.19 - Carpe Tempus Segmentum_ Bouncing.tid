[[TTTOTW]], Fireman Time!, LoLvod. Poyfect.

Sleep was solid. Anxiety is coming back. Don't think I'm the only one in the house here feeling it. Not sure why. Fireman Time! was pushing rope, but glad to do it.

Bugging my family members, making sure everyone has what they need, encouraging, etc. 

Practiced Dredge with my brother. He's getting there. I'm asking him lots and lots of questions to get at the intuitions of the deck as quickly as possible. He needs to practice, goldfishing would go a long way. I really want him to have this way to connect with my offspring, and it's way more fun when the playing field is even and people don't feel like it's all greek. It's not an easy deck to play well. Therapy is an artform in itself, and boarded games the real game.

A wild[[fireglow]] appears...

My son and I went to Home Depot while it was snowing. I hate driving in snow. Not a perfect selection, and it's clear that our PVC parts aren't compatible. Some old tech in here. Picked up nothing but hax (we don't have any more pipe tape or plumber's caulking either (though I have a caulking of a sort)), including a cuttable, reducing rubber p trap with metal clamps (glad I brought the parts with me; it was the only match in the store). Son and I practicing memorizing his information again (2 steps forward 2 steps back with him on this). He volunteered to install it, and I was Mr. Backup. He did a great job, and I made sure of it on my pass. Everything was tightened and tested. Should be alright. Still using the heater, and tried to deadblow the bottom boards back into place (no go, will need another solution). 

//Skintime//. My wife's day was packed. I'm doing better about remembering which committee names are attached to which functions. Smart unlocking of her remote work today up the chain, lots of winks I think. Her lip hurts. I'm not allowed to suck on it. Sex tho. Ragdoll. Y u m.

Made dinner for all who wanted it. Burgers, fixins, fries. Gave my wife lots of space. I think she needs it. She's feeling super low energy. That management class burns through it so fast. Made her comfortable, offered a massage tomorrow. No date planned. 

Prepping Δ⁸ cart refill. Not convinced this is going to work. Nm. It does.

[[TTTOTW]] and chatting with my daughter about her machine and the shopping spree she is on in planning out her Arch system. She's going for the full install and hoping to fix it once a GUI Network Manager is up (and, I should offer another option I know works). I know it's not Linux From Scratch, but there's still a bootstrapping to appreciate here. It's low-hanging fruit. I'm hoping she will design: [[Our Daughter: The Designer of Happiness]]. One of many mountains, love.

I bounce between people and my meditation.
