title: Friendship

//Omne meum est autem tuum. Take a leap of [[faith]]: [[Find The Others]]. Find the people worth living and dying for. I shit you not, having a [[good]] friend is like winning the existential lottery. What is both [[good]] friendship and the [[good]] of friendship? I'm here to put my skin in the game with you, but I'm underqualified to answer. Even optimistically, I'm bad at this. We'd need to learn from someone better than me, but I'll try to learn with ya. I can at least be your sounding board, sparring partner, and retarded mirror. 患难见真情. I philia, homie.//

<<<
When we honestly ask ourselves which person in our lives means the most to us, we often find that it is those who, instead of giving much advice, solutions, or cures, have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a gentle and tender hand. The friend who can be silent with us in a moment of despair or confusion, who can stay with us in an hour of grief and bereavement, who can tolerate not knowing, not curing, not healing, and face with us the reality of our powerlessness, that is a friend who cares.

-- Henri Nouwen, //Out of Solitude//

The ending inevitably matches the beginning: the person who starts being friends with you because it pays him will similarly cease to be friends with you because it pays him.

Note the difference between the minimum viable conception of friendship and the good of friendship as a practice, the virtue maximized.

* Definitions & Properties
** Taking delight in another's life.
** A long-term, positive relationship that involves cooperation.
** Those we would readily suffer for.
** [[Saint Aristotle]]
*** Friends for pleasure: Social bonds that are established to enjoy one’s spare time, such as friends for sports or hobbies, friends for dining, or for parties.
*** Friends for benefit: All bonds for which cultivation is primarily motivated by work-related reasons or by civic duties, such as being friends with your colleagues and neighbors.
*** True friends: True friendship and true friends are what Aristotle explains are mirrors to each other and "a single soul dwelling in two bodies," a second self.
**** Sharing common moral commitments
** Expressing and acting upon altruistic emotions and cognitions, deeply caring for and identifying with the good of another from whom one  knows oneself to be clearly other. Inescapably, we must compute [[The Good]] of [[The Other]]. It is [[The Golden Rule]] in action.

* [[Intimacy]]
** Being open, [[naked]], sincere, thinkin' outloud frankness.
*** Yet, sometimes not that. Knowing when to hold our tongue. Even pretending can be required.
** Distinguishing "close" from "good" 
** The safety of talking non-sense with each other. Listening.
** We have to take the risk of being betrayed. Conceptually, there's no way beyond the plateau without it.
** Friendliness is cheap, friendship is expensive.

* Getting Our Asses Kicked By Our Friends
** Readily forgiving. Perhaps always a way back.
** Seeing life from a different angle. Empathy.
** Friends are not blind to your virtues and vices, but they weigh them as best they can.
** The rarest friendships can be quite demanding.
** Justified companionship does not entail blind validation.

* We don't always know who our friends are.
** We don't even necessarily choose our friends either.
*** It's not necessarily private, voluntary, or an autonomous relationship between two equal individuals involved in a uniquely constituted dyad.

* Uni/bidirectionality
** Philia and agape

* Like vs. [[Love]]
** Friends that know you (and how shitty you are) and still like you...
** Friends that love you, even if they don't like you...
** Admiration, infatuation...these are fleeting. It's about the long-haul, and it requires idealizing someone with [[The Golden Rule]]
** The retarded kid who wants me to feel better but can't solve my problems may just be a better friend to me qua effort than the genius who accidentally solves my problem with a flick of her wrist.
*** Intention, Moral Motivation, is at the heart of [[The Moral Law]]
** Familiarity and [[Intimacy]] are insufficient. To some degree, they aren't necessary (only to the extent one ought).

* Virtue-Theoretic Egoism
** Moral Anti-realist interpretations of selfhood and quasi-purpose in merely hypothetically completionist and foundational teleological reasoning toward the good of oneself, internalism, and convenient solipsistry.
** It is not friendship per se that is important, but rather the trust, security, feelings of self-esteem and feelings of being loved for one’s own sake that flow from it

* Beyond prudence, [[love]]
** Fairweather Friends
** Yeah, friendship can have survival value, and it's especially valuable when it costs us survival and gives us other reasons to survive.
** "Feelings are contagious. 'Each happy friend a person has increases that person’s probability of being happy by 9 percent and each unhappy friend decreases it by 7 percent,'" Nicholas A. Christakis
** Enemy of my enemy
*** "One of the principal functions of a friend is to suffer (in a milder and more symbolic form) the punishments that we should like, but are unable, to inflict upon our enemies"...Aldous Huxley, Brave New World
*** We can't be friends with everyone. Everyone has enemies.
** Being judged by the enemies we've made, not just the friend we've made.

* Creation, maintenance, cultivation
** At least to some extent, [[Moral Luck]] plays a role. Our relationships are accidental to some significant degree.
** Artificial manufacturing has limits.
** Getting to know the people we don't like.
** Age Development of the Concept of Friendship
*** Aged 3/4 - Children start to use the term ‘friend’ to describe playmates
*** Aged 4/7 - Children start to appreciate that own views and identity are different from others
*** Aged 6/12 -Children start to be able to ‘put themselves in other peoples’ shoes’.
*** Aged 9/15 - Children/young people are able to take on the perspective of a ‘third person’; to look at interactions and, thus, to work on relationships.
*** Aged 12+ - There is a recognition that individual friendship is part of a larger network of relationships – and that friends are linked with others in ‘personal communities’. 
*** Adulthood - Dependence and independence are perceived as having a dialectical relationship with each other. Friends rely on each other both for support and a sense of personal identity, but also accept that each needs the space to develop relationships with others. There follows a growth in maturity through such experiences. 

* Resiliency
** Space and time separation 
*** You miss each other.
** Proofs, surviving adversity
** Arises from iteration, slowly cultivating the structures of trust and respect.

* Means vs Mere Means
** These are the people before me. How can I be useful to them?

* Dunbar Number; ingrouping policy limits
** ~1500, including up to the ability to put names to faces
** ~500, including up to acquaintences 
** ~150, including up to casual friends
** ~50, including up to close friends
** ~15, including up to confidant+sympathetic+intimate friends
** ~5, including up to your inner-circle support group
** ~X, the dead-body in the trunk friend, SOs, life partners, soulmates

* Historiography, Sociohistoricity
** The rise of "friendship" in modernity given the fall of kinship obligations, civic responsibilities and the mutual care of reciprocities engendered by being trapped in communities of fate.
** Variance in how the word is applied, translated, and mutated; invariance in the concept.

As separate from the concept of [[Family]]

I think socialization is deeply invested in processes of approving and approval-seeking of different kinds and to various degrees. That I want to be accepted by you is not a bad thing. I think friendship is concerned with approving of each other in important ways.

Fake friends are like a shadow: they follow you in the light and leave you in the dark.
