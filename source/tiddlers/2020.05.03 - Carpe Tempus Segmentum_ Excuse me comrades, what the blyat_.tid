title: 2020.05.03 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Excuse me comrades, what the blyat?

* Woke at 10
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Read+Write
* Chats
* [[Family Time]] began at 2.
** We've been trying to figure out when it should begin.
* Ate our frogs first with [[TTP]]s. 
** Mostly pure hell for two hours. 
** I am grateful that everyone will argue with me. It's no fun to stand and wrestle.
*** I'm mean AF, and, ofc, I know I'm right (always do). It's been months though. Escalation.
** I don't know how the project will turn out, but I know it's important to try.
* Chicken, waffles, strawberry salad, apples, honey
** Been a while. My offspring cannot remember ever having had chicken and waffles (and I'm not sure if they have). 
** We debated who had the most Southern taste in food. A woman who doesn't like biscuits and gravy has no room to talk. =)
* Read our wikis
** Mine is the least fun of the bunch. 
** It's easy to sing praises at this point. I'm grateful. 
** I can feel the pulse in us.
* Late night walk
** Technically, we aren't supposed to be on the path after sundown. 
*** We aren't going to get caught, and even if we were, we can trade in on our privileged atomic family credential. 
** I hope our walks continue to be late at night. Family in the spookiness, kinda perilous beauty to it. 
** I'm finding myself quieter on walks. Listening more. Alrighty then.
*** I tend to be quieter with the whole gang. Off in my head too.
** Next time, the offspring take us to their special place they've got.
** We found a second "CV19 is a hoax" message, lol.
* Finished up [[Family Log]]
* Hugs and kisses.
* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
* Sleep by 3:30
** Jesus.
