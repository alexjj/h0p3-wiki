* Think About It

*** I'm unable to step this far just yet. Legalizing and making it freely available, yes. I agree to the elimination of psychopathy in our species, but it is not easy to define a just way to do so.
** https://phys.org/news/2020-06-physics-neural-networks-chaos.html
*** That...kinda...makes sense. It borders on being religious when I look at that.

*** Only seems to fit a small subset, even when you take Bayesian reasoning as far as you can go in thinking about empiricism. I see it as an interesting signal for others too. Suffers all the feasibility problems of quantifying quality, but I agree it must be done in many cases. It's not even close though.

*** It is often the case that I see philosophers fail to see the necessity of moral reasoning as the fundamental and inescapable question of epistemology itself, and, no, it cannot be reduced to [[The Beautiful]]. The is/ought problem runs deep. The place I argue is wildly uncool. 
*** [[Justice]] is that intersubjective empirical work toward the ideal ideal. Of course it must be translated into a machine itself! What the fuck do you think you are computing? I despair watching even the [[pleft]]ist go right off the fucking postmodern rails.
