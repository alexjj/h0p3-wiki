[[TTTOTW]]. Sleep by 1.

Woke at 9. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

A wild [[avesta]] appears...

Took [[ASK]], [[j3d1h]], and [[1uxb0x]] to the gamer store about half an hour away. The website was not as informative as it could have been. Showed up to a Pioneer (new format to me) tournament already underway. Very large store. Legacy on Mondays, 7-10, 3 rounds, 10 to get in, credit on win ratio alone. They had a mox jet for $4200. Lawd. Unfortunately, the moment we sat down, someone felt compelled to see our vaccination records (my son didn't have any evidence, and has never been asked for it). Yup. Left. Checked out the food store next to it, and the prices were absurd.

//Skintime// with mi amor. Already missing me. :P. I rarely sleep well without her in the house. Do what we gotta do. ⁸Δ⁸.

[[MTG]] at the table. Almost had a full round-robin tournament. Seemed like fun was had by all. My daughter even asked to play a totally different match, affinity vs gobbos. 

[[Family Time]] was smooth. We tried the dried watermelon. It was way too sweet. The texture wasn't as bad I was worried, but it is not watermelon. Lots of thinking about [[The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum]], politics, philosophy, etc. Found out my sympaticon just purchased the book I've been holding for her birthday. =D.

Made dinner.

Pizza, candy, and water. //Good Omens// begins. Dadnap.

Woke at 9:45. Delicious. Fireman Time!

Put mi amor to bed. Daughter's nail is cracked deep. Superglued it. Honeydo chore. [[TTTOTW]]. Cleaning.

[[MTG]] with my sympaticon.

Finished playing MG Infect vs Titty Burn. Fast games. Cleaning the Sai. It's not working again. `/sigh`. Aftermarket coil might be part of the problem, but I also think the mod is too finicky. We'll see. Cleaning.

[[TTTOTW]], //Final Space//, then //Money, Power and Wall Street//. Seeing more and more people provide arguments that we need to save food, a just in case. `/nod`. Chat on Plebbit about the matter too.

Laundry. Also, somehow enough paper went through the washing machine that it clogged a drain. Caught it pretty quickly, thankfully.

My sympaticon graciously lowered my ears. Shower. 

[[5c0ut]] came down. Talked shop. Busy AF. Plans and {[[Dreams]]}. [[ASK]] had some good ideas for his specials too. Thinking about the owners' personalities and behaviors. 

We were all set to hit the food bank, but they closed. Wish we remembered which one handed the bags out. 

Finished up [[MTG]] tourney. Son's Unrestricted MUC vs MWC. We made through 75% of our decks, told me he has capsize, and I scooped. ⁸Δ⁸. [[TTTOTW]]. Dadnap. Woke up high AF. Jesus. 15 drops from the tincture was puh-lenty.

[[JRE]] called me up. Marty needs some work done, and we're gonna pitch in (my daughter said she wanted to come, but not necessarily work). Gonna be a dope project day for a man who likely deserves it. [[Q]] may have enjoyed the bidet too much. My bro is feelin' off, maybe depressed, maybe somewhat alone. Has a doctor's visit on the Monday we arrive, super important. Took a class and a test on modifying instruments at his job. May need to retake (bunch of stuff on there that isn't exactly electrician work, though adjacent). Only take 3 weeks off for paternity because he wouldn't want to lose his place in line for shift change. Suggested the work garage again. He was pulled over to maintain reception, and then had to jet, understandably.

Offspring workin' on their decks. Found some clear missing cards for Affinity. We've all got decks that are a decade old. Chilled with mi amor. Insane day for her. Some real spy shit, absurd how much her network matters.

Shopping @ W-Entity with my sympaticon and mi amor. Replaced the bulbs. Watermelons, snacks for her trip, small garbage bags.

//The Walk// with mi amor. Didn't get to do the full route since we were pressed for time. [[Sho]]'s unhappy that they are building wind turbines near her island because it ruins the view. 

[[Family Gathering]] was delicious. We had potatoes au gratin with ham, some chicken for mi amor, veggies and juice with couscous. Water. Folks had some candy too. Watched the episode where House's mom fakes cancer. I worked on a deck for my son, since he really should see the evolution of his deck.

My sympaticon chilled with me as finished construction. She hit the hay. Put mi amor bed. [[MTG]] with the offspring, briefly. [[MTG Deck: The One Long To Rule Them All]]. [[1uxb0x]], [[j3d1h]], and [[5c0ut]] came to see the deck (one we've drawn up on the blackboard at the dining table more than once). 

Yogurt. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].
