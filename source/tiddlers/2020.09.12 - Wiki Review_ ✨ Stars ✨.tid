* [[2020.09.11 - Link Log: Gaslit Into Believing Fighting For Justice Is Unjustifiably "Divisive"]]
** Pulled in a billion directions.
** Digital voting still seems best if I'm going to avoid violence.
* [[2020.09.11 - Wiki Review: Queued For Grinding]]
** Completed. Reminds me of the amplification of the sound of planes rumbling in the skies while on LSD.
* [[2020.09.11 - TDL: Press Down On Belly To Fart]]
** I'm glad you just dreamt and enjoyed window-shopping.
*** Even if we don't get to have a house (and we probably won't), it was a breath of fresh air to see something to work for. 
** Buying longer shelf-life items lately. 
* [[2020.09.11 - Prompted Introspection: Three Realistic Goals]]
** I like your realistic goals, sir. Keep your expectations of yourself as low as possible, lol. Meh. Hard to be realistic with high confidence in the whirlwind.
