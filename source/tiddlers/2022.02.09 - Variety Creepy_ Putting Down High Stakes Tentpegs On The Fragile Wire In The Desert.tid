title: 2022.02.09 - Variety Creepy: Putting Down High Stakes Tentpegs On The Fragile Wire In The Desert

//May it be a dope tent. Never give up, sir. [[ridtyawtr]].//

<br>

Dear Variety Creepy,

I wish you the best of [[luck]] in your studies.<<ref "th">> You know how highly I think of that hard work. It's always an honor to meet a [[good]], honest student. You show us how it's done, sir. Given that I've more time than usual to respond, I'm going to pore over our [[correspondence|hyperconversation]] (including the contents of the contextlink below),<<ref "p">> mull it around, and, with my skin in the non-mere [[game]], be thinkin' of you, your well-being, and your justifiably robust, eunoiac, purpose-filled, regret-minimized, antihiraethical future selves, sir.

I know my obsessive, carefully brutal,<<ref "tp">> candid, and anti-casual messages (tall towers of text of the non-variety creepy type, no doubt) are still [[difficult to interpret|hlexicon]]. They always will be, I'm afraid (even for those who have read every word multiple times). Even native speakers know my schizogibberish is often too painful to read (and, your English is [or will be] probably better than mine). There's always so much at stake in our lives. I've appreciated how, even [[from the beginning of our relationship|2021.03.28 - Variety Creepy: Out of the Blue]], you've endeavored to understand what I have to say (and, you're a skilled empath too). Thank you.<<ref "oc">> It's been my privilege. 

I'm sad to see that [[Session|2021.09.25 - Computer Musings: Session Fucked]] didn't work for us (in multiple respects), and, I [[hope]] you'll come to see the value in Tox still. [[Privacy]] has been a topic we've both been thinking about for a while [[now|https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/spa8de/i_was_watching_dragon_ball_z_videos_on_youtube/hwdzfr5/]], and you've continued to be willing to [[change]] your mind on the matter.<<ref "ih">> I've enjoyed that you've had such strong opinions about [[computing]]. As a n00b on his journey, I'm always in need of more perspective.

This will seem insignificant to you, but it means quite a bit to me: I'm [[grateful]] that I got to show you a place in this ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî± vanishingly few people even knew existed at the time (of the small group who even knew of it at all, most thought the [[Pause]] lasted much longer than it did...just a week, actually<<ref "an">>). In an odd way, I consider it a gift to a stranger in the desert, as though you were even closer to me than my own brothers.<<ref "afto">> Whatever the metaphor or more ought to mean, we're [[sharing]] a piece of our souls together, and though we maintain non-trivial [[dok]] of [[privacy]], I'm glad we work to do so openly and with due diligence as well.

Again, keepin' it real, yo, we come to the essentializing<<ref "ds">> [[verification|Verify]] of our identities (and [[gfwiwcgws]], ofc!), and here the sociotechnical aspects of our accounting are so small next to the central existential considerations. As respectfully as I know how (and I do work to come correct before you), it is where I will always [[wrestle]] with you, sir. [[IA2DYJ]] as a methodical and thorough (though wildly [[fff]]) interlocutor, [[WINTCIS]]. I have nowhere to turn to with these comments and questions besides directly asking you (and, you've likely [[change]]d quite a bit since you've said many of these words). I want to know with you who you were, are (including who you could be), and will be, of course. So, here goes:

<br>

; ¬ß2

* My dude, it is nearly the anniversary of our [[friendship]]! I know that might be trivial, but, in any case: happy anniversary, homie.
* Has being ace grown any easier over the year?<<ref "hs">>
** How has your ~~[[family|https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/spcbdo/what_is_a_secret_that_you_hid_from_your_parents/hwgmg50/]]~~ brother taken it? 
** Have you found more people who understand you more or at least felt less alone about it over the past year? 
** Though it is not conceptually the case, empirically and currently, do you think the ace community has a higher-than-average rate of self-absorption or people who are less interested in commitment to relationships? Are they more likely to be [[intimacy]]phobic? Are they more likely to lack experience in other social aspects of the human condition? Do they tend to have their "shields" up more consistently than [[others]]? Insofar as you can even hazard generalizations, what have you noticed about the kaleidoscope of fellow aces? I simply know far too little.
* How's your physical [[diary|https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/sklhnv/im_5_days_away_from_my_one_year_anniversary_of/hvnfuhn/]] writing going? 
** Still considering the possibility of going fully digital? TW is dope for this.
* Did you ever get your driver's license?<<ref "ic">> 
** Does that come in stages for ya?
** If you had to guess, proportionally, how many people have a license in your city? Similarly, how many people who you personally know have one?
* I'm enjoying the fact that I anticipated your future concern about wishing you could study [[the humanities|2021.03.28 - Variety Creepy: Out of the Blue]].
** And, ironically, I've enjoyed that I'm the one asking the humanities-based questions instead (which is my job*).
** I'm still trying to help you accomplish this task on your own, in your leisure time, even if you don't get a piece of paper for it (and, I would have doubts about anyone selling that paper to you too).
*** I [[hope]] you will continue to question why education curriculum in your country has not allowed it to some [[dok]]. It wanes considerably in my nation, and there are parts of it that are banned, heavily discouraged, or even outlawed (depending on the jurisdiction*).
** If you are interested in [[piracy]] (or need [[help]]), the offer stands.
** Even if you haven't been speaking in-depth with more people, have you been able to //find// more people to have "this kind of conversation" with?
* I want to more explicitly disagree with the claim that "trolls don't respond back because they know that if they do, they have everything to lose." 
** That may be the case sometimes, but I've found plenty of exceptions offline and online.
* Do you feel any closer to understanding answers to your questions: ["Why do you type all of this out on the internet? I mean... what's the point?"]?
* Do you still really believe "[[There is no point of anything in life...All of this are just stuff to do so that we don't get bored.|2021.03.31 - Variety Creepy: Straight To The Point]]"?<<ref "ms">>
** Depression sucks. `/nod`.
*** I don't mean just occasionally feeling that way. I'm concerned with your epistemology more generally here too. 
** Can you think of objectively better reasons to pursue anything beyond boredom?
*** Do you still agree to the claim: ["I'm never satisfied. Nothing does. I want everything."]?
** Do you really still think (and, I'm perhaps putting words into your mouth, so please correct me) this world is basically reducible to a meatgrinder?
** In addition to your own health, what other things have you cared about and committed yourself to this past year?
** Do you still agree to your claims: ["There are some people who strive to be high ideals. But truth to be told, it does not lead them anywhere. It's sad to see that. Been there. Done that."] and ["I'm a pretty lazy person who doesn't do anything for anyone."]?
* You essentially said that people who don't use you as mere means are the ones you [[love]]. Do you still believe that? 
** Does that girl who has been interested in you count as one of those to you?
* Your interest in politics (e.g. like your comment on [[Merkel|2021.04.29 - Variety Creepy: We Are Glad You Are Here]]) seems to come and go. IPR and Covid seemed to have you fired up. 
* How do you square your claims that ["All people care about is how you useful you are to them."], ["People have selfish interests."], and ["If people cared, the Middle East and Africa would not have been in this sorry state it is right now."] with your claim that 96% of people deserve to be happy?
* What does your dad think about your socialist views? How about your brother, and your mother?
** You claim that "Only the modern day slave labourers pay taxes." Is your family an exception to that? Does your family benefit from your father's legislation concerning VAT and GST? What do you think of landlords?
*** You have predicted that economic warfare will be the cause of the next world war or revolution. Is this in virtue of specialized knowledge that isn't as accessible to the public but would be more common to [[wrestle]] with in your own household?
** It's interesting hearing your views on the wealthy. Do you consider yourself non-trivially shielded from the ravages of capitalism?
*** Let me also add that I think quite highly of how your family lives in a modest [[1300sqft living space|https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/smpb3m/what_is_an_unfortunate_reality_with_work_from/hw1e7kr/]].
* Do you still believe that military service in your nation is noble and that the institution doesn't primarily exist for fighting even //possible// wars (or even simply providing the appearance of such a capacity)?
* Have you found any more pieces of writing, like the [[Panchatantra|2021.04.30 - Variety Creepy: Panchatantra]], to [[help]] you read a person's mind, or help you realise what kind of a person someone is within a single conversation?<<ref "‚Ñç">>
** How does it stack up against [[The 48 Laws of Power]]? 
** Do you have any concerns or doubts about that method, style, or approach to socializing?
** [[Getting to Know Someone in X Questions]] have been reasonably valuable in speaking with average [[anonymous]] people. 
* Do you think any of the work your family does merits endangering? 
** Do you think the privileged should be among the first to stick their neck out?
* You've said that, "I would not like the people in real life know that I am kind or anything." Do you still believe this, and why?
* You've been dabbling in [[anonymizing]] tools (and slowly working your way toward speaking about them with me this year). You have also claimed that, "The way [people] would act in anonymity is the true self" (which aligns with the [[ROG]] claim I brought up in our earliest conversation). How do you use your [[anonymity]], and what does it express or represent {[[about]]} your true self?
* Why should we think "We cannot make the internet democratic"?
* I'm going to keep trying to convince you to use HN like you do Reddit. It's a place you would benefit from.
* Your claim ["Don't ever do anything for anyone unless you absolutely know that they would do the same to you. That is a principle I have in life.  I'm not some person's tissue or toilet paper. They think of me when they want me, after I'm used, I'm discarded."] and ["I stopped being a doormat to a few of my friends"] continue to stick out to me. 
** Sometimes we should asymmetrically give of ourselves in a way that runs the high risk of being discarded or unreciprocated, right? I will agree, however, that one must work to be fair to oneself in the overall analysis (to fittingly recognize and respect one's own dignity among all persons), and for some folks, being less giving and more selfish in their social algorithms, at least in some contexts, is a moral obligation. It sounds like you've been around a lot of evil people, sir. I'd like to know more about the best people you've ever met, even uni-directionally in parasocial relationships, even into [[fiction|Identifying With: Fictional Characters]]. 
* I [[hope]] you acquire more experience speaking to people on the darkweb so that you know how they act given your own anecdata. You may find they aren't "The worst humans to ever walk on this planet, of course."
* You previously said, "[[I don't want to waste another 30 years of my life here. And it's the prime time of my life. So no, it won't make sense living in India now.|2021.05.19 - Variety Creepy: Switch]]" You've changed your mind since then, I think. Do you think you'll continue changing your mind about the matter? Seems like there's plenty of thinkin' to do still.
* ["[[Dude.... I use the same thing but with trains|2021.06.10 - Variety Creepy: Dating]]."] is yet another place where we run into traintalk. I'd like to know how much thinkin' you've done about autism (I often have a magnetic connection with autists). 
* Some of my [[Root Users]] aren't convinced you paid much notice to the ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî± for the first few months of our relationship, and they thought it unlikely you found your way back to the ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî± all on your own back in December. That may be inaccurate, but it's an interesting notion. If it isn't inaccurate, what made you decide to come back to, presumably, the [[Timelines]] or [[Variety Creepy]]?
* I remain unconvinced that you have finally "[[kind of come to terms with all of my family stuff now.|2021.12.22 - Variety Creepy: Yo yo yo.]]" I think it may be more of a lull. You are a person who takes cycles seriously, and so I think "for now" is more fitting to claim.
* How's Mesut doing, sir? You bonding hard with him? Getting out the room to walk him must be quite difficult, but I could imagine it will be something you enjoy quite a bit in the long-run.
* I suggest you've been dodging more and more questions and comments lately, sir. I spend a lot of time thinking about the nature of [[silence]], and I have some practice in some quite difficult places here too. I know you're extremely busy as well, and I want you to go at the pace you see fit. I've been thinkin' about how you want to pick out what is [[salient]] with me. I realize you may not want to speak with me in the end. Just in case it need be said (and, I think I should): I hand you my [[Ol' Yeller Clause|The Ol' Yeller Clause]] card to play at-will. `/hands-it-to-you`.

; ¬ß3

> I have read your post. I need some time to reply to it because it might be a bit lengthier than usual.

Take your asynchronous time, homie. I was and am. We got time, and we'll make it count. I've only now, on the initial creation of this [[letter|Letters]], taken [[2022.02.05 - Variety Creepy: Let's Do It]] out of draft anyway. I don't know how long this one will stay in draft, but I appreciate the opportunity to have more time with this one. I'm doing my best. `/salute`. 

> I think about it in a lot of ways. Some of the ideas might work, some won't. I have an idea which I believe using which Africa could be fixed. That is all I think. I don't usually think of saving the world or anything.

I respect that you think about such difficult and absurdly large topics on behalf of [[others]], and I'm eager to hear what you have to say. Now, to be clear, I also think serving Humanity need not be so grand in every case, though I obviously agree that [[wrestling]] about the macroscale is a significant and persistent moral obligation. I will also agree that serving individuals can often be a service to all possible persons. Further, I think it's difficult to appreciate the consequences of our actions, and I do think that even small things may have enormous impact in enough cases that we should take small things quite seriously too. There are surely many parts to answering such a broad question.

> What makes you think that I will be an excellent teacher?

* As someone who has dealt with failed school systems that enable bullying (and, yes, I know exactly what it's like to be considered the brilliant weirdo and [[schoolshooter|https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/spkqmr/and_absolutely_nobody_seems_to_be_aware_of_the/hwgwrg2/]]<<ref "and">>...though that was before Columbine*), you know from experience, even from just your gut, part of what is desperately wrong with the institution. They need your perspective (and, to be clear, excellent teachers may still be likely to fail in their mission in many contexts).
* Despite what may be a well-earned and partially anti-social (I do not use this in a derogatory sense) disposition, you work to be empathetic [[irwartfrr]] (both with yourself and [[others]]), and that's an essential characteristic of [[good]] teachers.
* There are many kinds of teachers. I could imagine you've got a somewhat stable, neutral affect in places that many would not. You're relatively open. You bring an important point of view to the table, even in the face of terrible truths or predictions.
* Your dialectical abilities are well above average, and that shines in Socratic-method classrooms. In time, I could imagine a wide variety of students would benefit from [[wrestling]] with you on almost any topic given your general knowledge and quasi-insider perspective on [[power]] structures of the world.
* You already have an intuition about what sorts of conversations are worth having, and I think that may spark intuition pumps you can can and should [[share]], asymmetrically. It is quite rare, and it shouldn't be.
* The world needs teachers, and you've got plenty of privilege to fulfill that need. As an example, look in a 100 kilometer radius around you; you're an elite teenager. There are so many people around you who would benefit from knowing what you know, even if they don't want to hear it (most will not, for various reasons).
** I also think teaching need not be in a standard classroom like you've encountered.

> Quite opposite of yours. You believe that only 4% of the people deserved happiness. I believe that only 4% of the people deserve unhappiness.

Contrary, yes, but probably not opposite. I ask you to read my words carefully there (though I've mis-spoken so many times, ofc). That is not what I said. I understand this is an accidentally uncharitable mischaracterization. It may be valuable to reflect upon how I've drawn the lines here. You, no doubt, are a benefactor.

In any case, I'm thrilled to hear you believe many people deserve happiness. Why should anyone deserve happiness? And, what kind of happiness, and how much, and why? Is there anything more important than happiness, and how would we begin to even theoretically weigh such a thing?

> Well, I don't practice much, but I really do act pissed if I'm disturbed while I'm doing something. Like, I was eating lunch in college. I was watching RedBull Rampage 2021 on my phone. A guy was walking around talking to everyone... I acted a little disgusted and pissed when he disturbed me. He went away quickly.

* Do you consider appearing disgusted to be a disgusting practice?
* RedBull Rampage is pretty cool. I'm reminded of the X-Games I watched long ago. Very exciting.
** You bust out that skateboard yet, homie? Punk AF activity and an interesting crowd to have hung around (I cannot speak to Bangalore's skater culture, obviously), imho.
* There's something to be said for voicing our disgust, being grumpy, and pissing people off. Negation does important work. Picking our battles with fitting integrity, [[WINTCIS]], is a difficult matter.
* What did the guy talk with you and everyone about?
** Some interlocutors can be quite sticky. What would you have felt, thought, and done if he hadn't went away quickly?
** I'm surprised that you didn't [[pause]] your watching to speak with the person. It seems a valuable opportunity for you.

> He was a teacher of something we had called, 'Value Education' and 'Career Guidance'. He was also one of the school's therapists. 

`/nod`. Sounds like practical wisdom, even. That must be quite a difficult class to teach. None of us are sufficiently prepared. 

> You're doing the right thing. Being realistic will only make them appreciate you in life. You didn't lie to them like the others do.

`/salute`. That is high praise, sir. Thank you. I have some difficult points to continue picking out. It's my vocation.

> I doubt it. I have tried to teach my fellow classmates many times and I have failed miserably. I really don't know.

Including the pedagogy of pedagogy itself (I have some pretty negative things to say about this vocation turned industry as well), most people are terrible students even when they are supposedly trying, myself included all too often, sir. Teaching even close to ideal students can be hard. Some people are naturally gifted in every aspect of teaching, but neither of us are that, I suggest. Imho, most [[good]] teachers have to //become// [[good]] teachers. Don't let a few failures with classmates be the only attempts and anecdata you've got for this problem. Try a wide variety of contexts (I think you might be surprised here) with preparation. Some lessons you may teach could take decades to develop. 

> By the way, what electives do you teach?

I don't officially teach standard classes anymore. I've taught in a variety of settings, sometimes formally, sometimes informally. Professionally, I've been paid to teach the humanities, music, religion, and philosophy, and it's been a part of many other jobs I've had, [[WINTCIS]]. I do an alright job [[help]]ing folks use their computers sometimes. I spend a lot of time [[wrestling]] with people too. The older I get, the more I look at every context as a classroom. We're all learning together.

> I really do not like politics. It's shitty and I hate it. It is something I would not like to pursue as a career. When I say politics, I'm talking about the stuff they show on TV, "Mr 'X 'of Party 'Y' just gave his opinion on an event 'Z' which was hurtful to community 'Q' and now they are protesting" Things get further worse.

Indeed, you have talked about some of this before. And, I will continue to bring it up. 

That seems to be an artificially narrow definition, and I do appreciate talking shit about the fabricated controversies that detract from legitimate discourse. Don't you think the [[spectacle|Deh Ga Buh, Gi Duh Bo, Megiddo]] (and you only pick out a part), usually a political apparatus for engaging in manipulation, is still only a subset of all that we should call politics? Can't we despise enormous parts of what is political while still acknowledging there are parts that we shouldn't hate, and, more importantly, are obligated to participate in (and, surely, we can be obligated to participate in something we don't enjoy)? Your father's work is overtly political and may not even match the definition you've pointed to either. Understandably, you've perhaps been conditioned to see "politics" as a swearword, in a sense. I ask you, again, to pursue, in [[good]] [[faith]], a broader concept of politics. I know you are fully capable of searching on your own here, but if you'd like some explicit recommendations, let me know.

> I am not at all interested in political pettiness. All of the are petty issues that are made worse.

I [[hope]] you don't mean to imply politics are conceptually petty. This is an important topic though: what is pettiness? (And, do you think my argument here is unjustifiably petty?)

> Also, I am legally bound to not talk about politics anywhere. My dad works for the government and I am one of my dad's dependents. It's better for me to not involve myself with politics of any kind. I think I am allowed to talk about International Politics where India is not involved. I just don't like stating my opinions(and I'm not even allowed to). I don't want to know about others' opinions either. Maybe, if I become an American citizen, then I will talk about American politics. Or if I stay an Indian, I will wait till my dad retires before I say anything.

As I have suggested before, write [[anonymous]]ly.<<ref "ar">> I can show you how to limit the risks. One does not actually escape being political, even in [[silence]]. 

* What do you think about the fact that you aren't legally allowed to speak about some types of politics? Is it justified? 
* What do you think about the distinction between a moral law and a juridical or positivist law (one merely generated by what is conceptually a valid though not necessarily justified government)?
* Just because you are dependent upon your father doesn't mean you shouldn't. There are things more important than our own survival too.
* "better for" you in what respects? Does that make it justified? Just because an option has better outcomes (and for whom?) doesn't make it the right thing to do.
* It's not clear to me you're an oppressed person, so I have little sympathy for being unwilling to state your opinions here. 
* Why don't you want to know about other's opinions about [[justice]]?
* You can engage in political discourse and theory without having to speak directly about any particular nation.
* So far, your arguments concerning politics seem pretty selfish.
** To a non-trivial [[dok]], I respect that you don't want to engage in conflict. You won't be able to avoid it with me unless we have a shallow or silent relationship (and even then, it will still be there).

> Hmm. Okay, You got me. Now I have to sit and think about what I find weird.

`/salute`.

> Yes, I am her friend and I don't know about love. I don't think I love her. I like her, not love though.

What is [[love]], and how does it contrast with [[like]]?

> Uh, she's not wrong that I'm hopeless. But oh come on! What's wrong in asking? Also, I'm sorry, mate.

Nothing wrong with asking, sir. Nothing to be sorry for either. She thinks we are cute and she is glad to know we exist. She doesn't really think you're [[hope]]less (except perhaps being hopelessly adorable), not by a long-shot. You've triggered fond memories in her. Sir, I shit you not, [[I am retarded|Give Me A Hint]]. Good times.

>I can say that there are other interpretations of that behavior

> Well, yes. I agree with you. I'm not a wizard to read her mind. All I can do is wait.

I respect that patience more than I know how to put into words. May you never achieve [[wizardhood|https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Wizard]] either. 

All that said, I'm hoping you will become someone who can often nearly read her mind, even when she can't. That may not be possible in many cases, of course. It is a [[hope]] and a responsibility. 

> They are just handful and not popular at all...Look, the Chinese are bad, but not all of them are inherently as bad as they portray in the media.

We probably agree for the most part. I'm nailing down the exact wording here. It's part of my job to be pedantic. I'll agree that many [[power]]ful institutions and their representatives, cogs, executors, legislators, adjudicators, and enforcers are bad. The average person does not even know how to study our data, track us, or manipulate us, though we might argue they are non-trivially responsible (however limited their individual influence may be) for what their governments and informally chosen (even by market) institutions do (not an easy problem). Not only is it not everyone, it's not even most people. I'll agree that the popular, easy, and cheap (not just in terms of money) options are profoundly infested, and also that exceptions are rare. I'll say it again: we can individually, collectively, and effectively fight against these forces.

> Have you used Tor? How is it? I have never been to the dark web.

I have some experience. I've been a long-time fan, user, and quiet contributor to some of these types of tools (since before you were born, even, including Tor). You should learn about and practice with these tools! We cannot have a scaling, high-functioning democracy in the 21st Century without a widespread comprehension, support, and use of these tools. 

Odd as it may seem, this ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî± is a part of the darkweb (many of the open parts of it, at least), though not exclusively. Further, given how the web has been consolidated and how most people seem to live within the confines a few walled gardens and silos, in practice, being outside it is effectively like being on the darkweb in many respects. 

> Well, I used to download games that were cracked by the Chinese. 3DM for example. I have played their FIFA games. Never faced any issues.

Ah. Dope. I adore [[piracy]]. Plenty of pirated software [[contains malware|https://i.redd.it/01w0zttfqhh81.png]] (and if you were aware that you had any, it wasn't terrible effective malware in many cases), but compartmentalizing it is a reasonable precaution. Keep looking at different kinds of free software (not just the type that merely didn't cost you money). One of the most important things I did in my youth (and still practice to this day), is reading about and trying a wide variety of software out of sheer curiosity. It continues to open my eyes.

> That's absolutely nice. What is your religion? I'm guessing it's Christianity. What sect of Christianity?

Why do you guess that? 

Where fitting and timely, I ask you to read and [[search|Hao]] the ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî± to find out. There's no other way to even approach charitably modeling my identity otherwise. My short answer for you here is hardly sufficient, and my answer to the questions vary with my interlocutor's abilities. I'm glad that some things are relatively stable across the answers I've been required to give as I've [[change]]d too; it's quite a gift in life.

It depends on who you ask, [[gfwiwcgws]], and so forth, and so on. To my eyes, very few people have any idea how to define Christianity well, especially with fitting charity and epistemic humility (I'm as elitist as they come on the matter). I see people who have had bad experiences (and my bad experiences with self-proclaimed christian bodies are deep and wide here) who tend to fail to explore any further, and I can empathize to a non-trival [[dok]] with the knee-jerk reactions I find. You're more open than most I meet. 

Here's the short answer: I'm a philosopher of religion, and I also agree to a version of the two greatest commandments (which is not exclusive to the New Testament, but is reasonably stated there). It is often the case that self-identifying non-Christians think I'm too Christian, and self-identifying Christians think I'm too non-Christian. It is fair to say I believe in what some call the philosopher's concept of divinity. I don't meet a lot of people who claim to be Christian who I think are actually Christian. I would not claim to have achieved such a thing, but I respect those who do more than I know how to put into words (and, lawd, have I tried to put it into words). So, yes, I have a profound background in it. We can walk through that if you want.

Though I have my doubts, I may end up directly speaking with [[Impassionata]] about some of these matters, if you're interested too. Sir [[DeathOfRobinhood]] is a [[good]] man, and is an image of Christ to me. My wife is Christian^^tm^^, one who could drown us both in her knowledge and experience in the matter. Many people who [[connect]] with me have a background (usually a difficult one) with institutions that claim to be Christian, most of whom deny having any such [[faith]].

> I used to follow Hinduism because I was born to Hindus. I'm not religious anymore. I quit believing in religion and God a long time ago. I don't do any religious practices others do. My parents aren't overly religious either but they believe in God. Hinduism is nice and all. All religions are good in most ways but humans in groups are bad. I respect people who believe in God and follow their religion, but yeah, I don't and I won't. I don't consider religion as a weakness, but instead as a chore which I am not willing to do.

I am far from convinced you aren't religious. I don't think most people even know what they are saying when they attempt to claim that. It is not any easy concept to analyze. I agree that humans in groups are often bad, but not necessarily. I can see it may be a chore you are not willing to pursue much at the moment. I wish you [[luck]] in the matter. We all need it.

Everyone has something they pursue, assume to be valuable enough to get out of bed for (as is our plight), and even worship. No person is actually irreligious. An atheist is still religious (though you'll find plenty of experts who would despise that claim). Even the person who claims not to care about religion can be wrong about their self-identification. Whether or not, for example, one believes in a personal or impersonal God, they worship something they take to be worthy, even if they are eliminative materialists, pyrrhonists, and so forth, and so on.

If at all, it will take you some time to see that I do make space for pluralism to various [[dok]]. I am listening.

> Both of us are right in our own ways. You are entitled to your opinion, I am entitled to mine. Let's keep it that way.

I had a few [[Root Users]] smile when you said this (they've all been there with me, or at least seen others say it to me). It's often painful to argue with me. It's my job to make people feel uncomfortable [[irwartfrr]], [[WINTCIS]].

I see little reason to agree to the claim that we are both right in our own ways in this case, and I'm interested in what that phrase means more generally too. Why should I think we are entitled to our opinions? What is the exact entitlement in this case, and what justifies it? What makes you think it is up to us to keep it that way? Or, what is up to us in this case?

I can appreciate how you might not want to speak about it. If anything, what should we talk about instead, and why?

> The amount of people who get into the trains are too much for the ticket master to even check whether each person has one. Also, these people might not be even able to afford to pay every day. The government is not trying to make money out of it. They are providing transport. It's a service, not a business. Things are much worse in North India. They will beat the shit out of the ticket master if he asks for one. They consider it is the government's duty to provide these for free and since it's public property, they are entitled to use it however they want.

I wouldn't want to be the ticketmaster.

To my eyes, it is not just your government's duty, but mine as well. It is the duty of the people of the planet today, albeit that would require a radical redistribution of wealth that is unlikely (though not impossible [a word I try not to use lightly]). I [[hope]] they will heap blame upon the wealthiest on the planet especially. 

> Well yeah. Contacting would only make it bad. You guys are both busy. You both have your own life. Trying to start a friendship now would only lead to a failure and that would be disappointing to both. It would also ruin the old memories for you.

Hrm. These claims are not obvious to me. I cannot say it "would only make it bad." I have come across exceptions. It often adjusts how I think and feel about old memories, but it doesn't necessarily ruin. I think it's difficult for many people to build a rich, in-depth relationship with me (though it can be lightning quick for some). It requires a lot of work. In my experience, there's usually radical gaps and asymmetries, some of them contingently (rather than necessarily) incommensurable appearing, more than most humans would encounter. Others may have more success than I have in reconnection endeavors.

I agree that I wish to cherish the golden amber memories I have, and that is often best accomplished by not reconnecting. [[ALM]] has been an interesting [[recent]] example, but I hold out [[hope]] for us.

> Okay, long story. You see, centuries ago, my ancestors were a group of people who would just clear out the forests and do farming in them. They settled there, did farming, if needed more land, they would clear out a bit more of forest land and farm.

`/nod`. That's probably true for almost everyone. I wonder how many generations we have to go back to find our [[shared]] genetic ancestry.

> There are like 10-20 clans like these as they did these stuff together and they all combined make my caste.

To what extent do you trust these stories, and how thorough are they? What's your caste? How do you feel about castes? How does that perspective affect your life and the lives of those around you?

> The story is that, when the person whose clan I belong to was born, his mother died during childbirth or shortly after the birth. He was hence raised by drinking goat milk and was protected by a cat. Out of respect, we are not supposed to eat goat meat or harm cats. People of other clans actually eat goats, but we don't. So yeah, not a religious reason, but a centuries old tradition.

Would you call it a mere social convention? You said, "I'm not allowed to eat goats for an ancient stupid reason." //Allowed// in what sense? It is still not obvious to me that it isn't a religious reason (even if it isn't explicitly your direct reason). So, why should I think it isn't religious, for you and others (perhaps in different respects)? How should we reason about the normativity of traditions?

> I will send the link to you when I'm done. It's still a work in progress and it needs a lot of time to be complete.

Dope. Are you considering using [[tumblr|https://www.reddit.com/r/CuratedTumblr/comments/soxkfz/therapist_rewards/hwbrl63/]] for it? 

You might consider simply drafting out in public too (I've been enjoying watching [[Herr ‰∫öÂΩì]] do this). There's something to be said for the practice. It will never be perfect enough, and that's okay. I'm happy to see it evolve too.

> I checked out Tiddlywiki. Is this what your whole website is? It looks nice, and I want to do it. Does it require much effort?

TW is a low-effort method for solving some hard problems. The barrier to entry is still relatively high for most people (I'm an intermediate user in many respects), but I think it's quite doable. Starting out, I recommend choosing a unique FF-based browser specifically for writing in your wiki, employing https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/file-backups/ and [[Resilio Sync]] (be thoughtful about race conditions across multiple devices), and using it every day. Perhaps think of it first as just a bunch of textfiles packed into one machine, and work from there. 

> Okay, I have something important to tell you. I will be having tests from the 15th of this month. I need to study for them because I haven't studied properly ever since the lockdowns have happened. I need to prepare and I won't be having time to reply. I hope that you understand the situation. I'm really sorry about this. Thank you, sir. I'll text you when I'm done.

Thank you for telling me. I appreciate that, and I understand. I realize you still may be speaking to [[others|https://www.reddit.com/user/Competitive_Fudge_96]] instead of me too. Please take all the time you need, make sure you're sleep schedule is fitting, and study hard AF, homie, with everything you've got! `/salute`.

> I find some time to scroll through reddit and I do it. 

Good. Keep your head above water, sir.

> I would love to reply to you but doing it would take 4-5 hours or even more this time. 

To be fair, many of my questions take a lifetime to answer, sir. I'm still answering them too. I [[hope]] you'll not only attempt to answer these this [[letter]] now, but again a decade from now (and beyond).

> I have tried Tumblr but it surely does not look like a blogging site to me. More like a social media site, to be honest. I will think over. I will use the easiest blogging site.

Long-term, and where applicable, I suggest owning your data (as best you can*) in plaintext, plain html, markdown, something like a TW (all wrapped up nicely), or whatever open format fits best. The same for the rest of your tools too, insofar as you can. Make that a rule in your life while the costs are still low. Distribution, syndication, and the various hangouts on the web continue to change; don't make a home on land controlled by those who seek to enslave you. Tumblr can be used for what is normally called blogging. I don't know what media isn't social (and I've been around the block), and it's worth lookin' at what types of relationships over these sites are the most ideal in the end. I'll continue to caution against simply going for what's easiest.

I am aware that often only the loneliest people would be willing to speak with the likes of me (pretty clear in [[FTO]]). In any case, I treasure your words, [[friend]].<<ref "ai">> They are precious jewels to me, affecting how I see the [[lights|·õùLight·õù]] of The World. I'm glad that we get to be proud of what we [[intimate]]ly and respectfully do and say to each [[other]] long-term. These are memories, trains, bridges, stakes, boats, and wires I care so much about. Insofar as I can, it's been a special experience to revisit all of them that remain available to me, and I'm glad I get to know better who we are together. It's my privilege, sir. 

[[Love]],

[[h0p3]]
