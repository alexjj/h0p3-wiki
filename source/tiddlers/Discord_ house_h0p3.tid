//I believe the experiment is complete. I tried. I failed. I am not convinced the medium is suited to depth, and it may even hinder [[intimacy]] formation at some level by design. I'm honored to have been able to speak with the people I [[love]], and I'm [[grateful]] that they took the time to interact together (and [[hope]] they will continue). I treasure these excerpts and more. Perhaps more good will come of this counterfeit shelter, and, at the very least, though I doubt it will be useful, most of my [[Root Users]] will have something like an inverted panopticon at their disposal. I'd like to thank Sir [[DeathOfRobinhood]] in particular; whether he intended it or not, I've learned a lot from him.//

[7:27 AM] k0sh3k: You're evil.
[8:30 AM] k0sh3k: At bedtime, I noticed Chairman Meow staring intently at a space under my bed, while Ranga lounged on the bed itself. I knew then where the chipmunk was. I took the mattress off the bed and started moving the base (a collection of cubbies) until Chairman Meow lunged at one and Alvin took off from the other side - straight up the curtains and into the window. I shut the window, so Alvin was trapped between the glass and the screen. My plan was to carefully open the glass enough to open the screen, so he could escape outside. Unfortunately, I don't know how to open the screen - I don't think it's meant to open easily. Anyway, while I was working on that, Alvin managed to find a crawl spot at the top of the window, where I couldn't reach him at all. I called h0p3 up to help, but he was pretty useless. I left him trapped there, with a bit of peanut butter and bread, and went to sleep.

[12:42 AM] h0p3: It is not easy for me to pick a favorite.
[12:43 AM] h0p3: They are all different worlds to me.
[12:44 AM] h0p3: What do you call each of em?
[12:46 AM] Sphygmus: the middle one looks better offline, ofc - the colors aren't totally accurate. I really wanted to push the bottom one farther, but couldn't think of anything to add, it feels self-contained and complete (also went a totally different direction than I expected when I started). the  top one went an interesting direction with the spiraling and layering (not my standard pattern / path)
[12:46 AM] Sphygmus: i couldn't call any of them anything if pressed :sweat_smile:
[12:47 AM] h0p3: then don't, I enjoy trying to guess their names
[3:20 AM] Sphygmus: messing about with animation - until my stylus died!

[3:20 AM] h0p3: !
[3:22 AM] h0p3: What did you use to make it?
[3:27 AM] h0p3: I imagine a tiny skateboarder or an [[N|http://www.thewayoftheninja.org/nv2.html]] (adobe flash warning) parkouring.
[3:27 AM] h0p3: Maybe it's got some kind of wave of darkness overtaking it. Will the light side grow deeper again?
[3:28 AM] h0p3: I could see it oscillate like that.
[3:38 AM] Sphygmus: ahh interesting! the plan was to cover the entire background with black, until my stylus ran out of charge -- but now I'm thinking about additional shapes that appear in the background, white on black
[3:39 AM] Sphygmus: that would be a cool angle to explore -- I don't usually draw white on black because it's incredibly sub-optimal with physical media, but no such restrictions apply digitally
[3:40 AM] Sphygmus: I used Pencil2D, which of the programs for Linux i very briefly looked at, appeared to (and did) have the least faffing about to get started
[3:41 AM] h0p3: What makes it suboptimal in physical media?
[3:43 AM] h0p3: I suppose you have to paint somehow, or something like that.
[3:44 AM] h0p3: White paint pens might never be fine enough too.
[3:44 AM] Sphygmus: yes, the biggest issue is that white pens are really awful generally
[3:44 AM] Sphygmus: they're usually never opaque enough to fully cover the black
[3:44 AM] h0p3: Ugh.
[3:45 AM] h0p3: Well, digital is dope too.
[3:46 AM] Sphygmus: later through the animation there were definitely issues I had with that program

- I would like to change one part and have it ripple through all frames where that part exists (so, some kind of isolation or layering where I can say "make this layer show in all frames going forward in time" then edit that layer later and those edits will then be visible in the later frames. Pencil2D is much more "each frame is an individual piece of paper"

- I would like WAY better camera controls; I rotated from + to x (the center shape) halfway through and that was nearly impossible in Pencil2D

- and it was just buggy in general (keyboard shortcuts occasionally not working, cursor states not updating, just annoyances)
[3:46 AM] h0p3: Sounds great for Linux, lol.
[3:47 AM] Sphygmus: timing in general (not specific to this program) is an issue that is really unique to animation and something I've run into experimenting with stuff previously
[3:48 AM] h0p3: I am not a man who understands nearly enough about this topic.
[3:48 AM] Sphygmus: like, when I make one long stroke, that takes up the same amount of frame time as one short tiny stroke -- but it has way more impact on the growth of the image (covers more space) and so should feel longer in time too...
[3:49 AM] Sphygmus: like, it feels very fast at the beginning because I'm getting the bones of the piece down, the big shapes
[3:49 AM] Sphygmus: and then I'm going in and adding smaller additional shapes, with smaller strokes, and it slows down in feeling because of it (you get a better look at the marks I'm making)
[3:50 AM] h0p3: Do you want to normalize the timeframes down to having the same amount of distance covered in each frame?
[3:50 AM] Sphygmus: yes exactly!
[3:50 AM] h0p3: I don't know how to do that. Lol.
[3:51 AM] Sphygmus: oh yeah me either lmao. There are programs (photoshop for sure) where you can set the number of second per individual frame - so, could set a standard then tweak by hand for frames with more distance covered
[3:51 AM] Sphygmus: but that's ... pretty tricky the few times I've tried it
[3:52 AM] Sphygmus: clearly I need to write some algorithm or something to solve that frame timing for me :craughing:
[3:52 AM] h0p3: Get it super fucking smooth, detailed into oblivion. Zooming into your flowery fractal yinyang.
[3:52 AM] Sphygmus: (although it's an interesting problem... I assume one would calculate the "area" of each frame then weight them somehow and apply math, lol)
[4:15 PM] Sphygmus: experimenting with Krita's animation options and making it more "animated" and less "timelapse" ... stylus ran out of battery again so this is still very unfinished :crying:

[4:17 PM] h0p3: Now it grows in multiple places simultaneously =).
[4:18 PM] h0p3: Are you going to aim to draw one quadrant (or maybe just an eighth?) and mirror it over?
[4:18 PM] h0p3: I like the organic messiness.
[4:19 PM] Sphygmus: digital does allow mirroring but I don't think I'll ever do that
[4:20 PM] Sphygmus: I can't really think in quadrants? the nice thing about doing the animation above is that I started from the whole picture and worked backwards, which allows me to think about the individual parts
[4:20 PM] Sphygmus: but I struggle with starting with the individual parts and working towards the whole picture
[4:21 PM] Sphygmus: which doing an 8th or a 4tr would amplify
[4:21 PM] Sphygmus: cause then it's not just individual parts but a vertical slice..
[4:22 PM] h0p3: I like the idea of having two different images and trying to bridge them together, fill in what may be inbetween.
[4:22 PM] Sphygmus: anyway conceptually one of the things I really appreciate is how not every individual line has to be perfect - there's a sort of "good enough" quality where as long as the lines are in the same place doing similar things, the eye sees the piece as a whole as intricate and detailed
[4:23 PM] Sphygmus: and mirroring takes that concept away, b/c then the majority of the piece is copy-pasted (in a sense)
[4:23 PM] h0p3: Better to embrace the appearance of imperfection.
[4:24 PM] 1uxb0x: I bet they have made or are making tech to mirror with imperfection.
[4:26 PM] Sphygmus: that would be interesting! huh. lol, I feel like imperfection and human error as a redeeming quality is something I point to when the "AI generated art will make human created art pointless" argument is brought up but.. I hadn't thought of "what if the AI also makes art imperfectly" :O
[4:28 PM] 1uxb0x: I never even thought of that when I though of tech mirroring with imperfection. That's a very good point, thank you for telling me this.

[4:40 PM] k0sh3k: Like, I think it's crazy enough that I have to pay more when I don't want the whole shampoo and dry thing, just a cut - but paying a couple hundred dollars? No thank you. I'll just do it myself and look shaggy.

[4:19 PM] k0sh3k:
Terrace

How long's it been?
Since we were so little -
Remember

Hot days making our clothes somehow
Too big and too small all at once
And we managed to stitch those days together
Seamlessly and fading each into each into other

Hopscotch Jump-Rope Miss-Mary-Mack
Jacks
Mother, May I?
Tag, You're IT!

Kaleidoscopically we'd pattern ourselves
This way - no, that way - shift and shatter and scatter
Faster and faster
We'd run to outrun
IT
Close behind us no matter how away we were or how quick we turned
Our voices singing out so sharp and so shrieky
"Hold up, hold up, "
We'd pant.

"I can't breathe
I can't breathe
I can't breathe."

And did IT ever listen?

Shoo, it's been too long!
Makes me tired,
Just thinking about it. 
[4:21 PM] h0p3: I am glad you wrote the poem.
[4:30 PM] K: Is there a way to work “IT” into the hot days stanza? :eyes:

[9:14 PM] h0p3: What struck you about the book?
[9:49 AM] K: It's hard to put it to words immediately. It's definitely your standard commercial YA novel, but it feels like the author went out of his way to frame it that way, intentionally. The way it hits on life and death, relationships, the countdown as a plot device, it all works together in a really compelling way. At least I think so. I actually preferred the first half only because it felt more coherent as a narrative, but the downward slope that the story takes is worth being there, even if the pacing is changed up in a dramatic way.

I see why my professor wants us to read this book, even though it's a bit intense for a younger demographic (the characters are all college age anyway), it still hits on important aspects of budding adulthood for teens. I wish it had more to say on those notes besides drunk driving is bad, don't do it, which is still critical. The struggle with life and death is prominent, but it doesn't really get enough screen time to properly develop, but I still appreciated it nevertheless.

[5:59 AM] h0p3: Aye, I can appreciate that concern. It is a criticism I see levied against the [[pleft]] from many perspectives (and some of them charitably so, as in this case). Prescription is hard, especially given the slim odds. One of my hypotheses is that the space to the left of the overton window is so large that we've not pumped the same kinds of resources, structures, and brainpower into it that the [[pright]] has enjoyed (as they serve capitalism, which, if it were to be anthropomorphized, aims to preserve its own ego [with capitalists as the homunculus] at all costs), and, so, of course, there should be a profound imbalance in discovered models.
[6:01 AM] h0p3: This is one of the reasons ⦗ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱: h0p3⦘ exists though. I am trying to provide a real-world example of p2p praxis and [[PSM]] (including prescriptive political modeling that the [[pleft]] is said to lack), [[WINTCIS]].
[6:12 AM] h0p3: Note that [[Žižek]] fails to even attempt to offer prescription himself here and only offers description.
[6:13 AM] h0p3: I will continue to argue that prescription requires a foundation in normativity. That's one of my first prescriptions to the [[pleft]]: give Saint Marx a moral (and thus epistemic) foundation.
[6:14 AM] h0p3: Ziz is in trouble here. He's lost in a pomo vortex. He can't effectively re-imagine Marx without becoming metamodern (and I'm not yet convinced he will).
[6:17 AM] h0p3: Democracy works when you have an educated and informed group trying to make rational choices in a limited context. It falls apart as soon as you have huge disparities in privilege, wealth, and education in a nation state - manipulated by industrial narrative management techniques engineered by small privileged castes fighting hard to keep and enhance their caste privileges at the expense of everyone else. You need relative equality of power between participants and groups for democracy to be viable.
[6:19 AM] h0p3: A sufficient threshold of folks have to be philosophers (most people). There's no way out of this. Beyond that, building proxies and representation (including voting) for epistemic authority and trust must rely upon skin-in-the-game friend-to-friend models. I am fond of the Neo-Kantian's approach to Second Personal Standpoint respect as a basis for [[FTO]] & [[TOP]].
[6:23 AM] h0p3: [[ridtyawtr]], as always. I see The Slip here, where it's all too easy to say: that's not likely enough to happen to be worth sacrificing for.
[6:26 AM] h0p3: I don't like my solutions, but I don't know what else to do besides what I'm doing.
[6:28 AM] h0p3: Most people want to say that (as Ziz is pointing out), but how many are justified in that claim?
[6:46 AM] h0p3: Moral merit obtains just in case an agent selects a maxim in virtue of it being universalizable. We should do the right thing because it's the right thing to do. My predictions are just as awful as Ziz's.
[6:52 AM] h0p3: I am claiming we have to fight dark-triadic egoism, and the Rand-Locke memeplex is deliciously convenient. 3% of adults above the age of 25 seem to have sufficient merit to me. I know we are limited in how much influence we have over [[others]] too. If only people would be justified, then we wouldn't have so much unjustified in the world. I will agree that a better system of government ironically becomes less necessary when the very conditions for giving rise to it obtain.
