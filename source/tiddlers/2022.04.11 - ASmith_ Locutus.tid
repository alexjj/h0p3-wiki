[18:02:56] [[ASmith]]: I updated my tor router in Ricochet refreshed and suddenly my contacts all vanished, seems my ricochet ID has changed :(
[18:03:34] [[ASmith]]: If you were among my Ricochet-refreshed contacts, added my previous ricochet ID, please update that to my new ricochet refreshed ID ricochet:gyfjncnmzwaw3stkubckrenyblugo62d4xjzp4pbwog26kzkop2h2pad
[18:03:39] [[ASmith]]: If you were among my Ricochet-refreshed contacts, added my previous ricochet ID, please update that to my new ricochet refreshed ID ricochet:gyfjncnmzwaw3stkubckrenyblugo62d4xjzp4pbwog26kzkop2h2pad
[18:41:05] [[h0p3]]: Thank you, sir.
[02:00:34] [[ASmith]]: I've installed the newest .deb build of ricochet-refreshed and it restored all of my presvious contacts and my previous ID. ricochet:6xnggokp7l6sx3mellsfbc4ebkz3qomyxnftp7el32szvow7b5jryfid
[10:09:37] [[h0p3]]: Dope. 
[10:10:15] [[h0p3]]: I ended up leaving Session because it failed to respect my ownership of my key. Just reset the database on me. 
[10:10:37] [[h0p3]]: I'm overjoyed to find tooling that respects the user in this way.

[22.04.11 - 15:47:24] [[h0p3]]: Sir [[ASmith]], I [[hope]] this will be somewhat exciting for you. There's a [[chance]] something becomes of it: https://github.com/freenet/locutus
[22.04.11 - 16:33:07] [[ASmith]]: Hi h0p3 how are you? thank-you for bringing the possible alpha development of the development of locutus decentralization project.
[22.04.11 - 16:34:20] [[h0p3]]: I'm hanging in there homie. Digging deeper into [[Ian Clarke]]. Gonna be talking to him (doubt he'll listen, but we'll see). 
[22.04.11 - 16:34:38] [[ASmith]]: the vision of what that project would encompass or eventually become is rather large with a great deal of inclusiveness which I like however its very pre-pre alpha at this stage
[22.04.11 - 16:34:38] [[h0p3]]: Working on the [[garden]] today some. Played some [[D2]]. Mostly my usual grind though.
[22.04.11 - 16:34:39] [[h0p3]]: How about you?
[22.04.11 - 16:35:25] [[h0p3]]: He says he'll have something next month, which...is possible given his track record over the past couple decades. I don't want to hold my breath though, as it appears he may have been working on this for at least 2 years.
[22.04.11 - 16:35:26] [[ASmith]]: unusual snow flurrys here this am, working on the hedgerows and preparing the garden. Thinking about adding more portable 20 gal grow bags
[22.04.11 - 16:35:37] [[h0p3]]: It's been quite cold here too. Destroyed our tomato plants.
[22.04.11 - 16:35:54] [[ASmith]]: yes tomato's are the first to die out with any freeze at all
[22.04.11 - 16:36:05] [[ASmith]]: it was 70F+ 2 days ago, snowing today
[22.04.11 - 16:36:39] [[ASmith]]: my $100 walkin green houses are hitting 95F here routinely if I close them up
[22.04.11 - 16:36:51] [[h0p3]]: dayum, noice
[22.04.11 - 16:37:54] [[ASmith]]: I noticed the $Dollar Stores are selling the stackable 3 petal planters for $1 that's about 7000% cheaper than the commercial costs elsewhere
[22.04.11 - 16:39:31] [[ASmith]]: the Russian-Ukraine conflict is like a slow fuse burning, I'm doing what I can to prepare for ever larger conflicts in the year and years ahead here
[22.04.11 - 16:51:25] [[h0p3]]: Perhaps. I consider that just one sign of the times. 
[22.04.11 - 16:51:58] [[h0p3]]: Inflation, carefully controlled to boil frogs, doesn't seem like it is going to be ending any time soon.
[22.04.11 - 16:53:14] [[h0p3]]: I've encountered serious arguments that 40% inflation (starting from covid) is already locked in (distributed over the years, and, ofc, we should doubt the numbers handed down to us from on high). 70% seems quite likely. I've seen arguments of 200% that seemed quite reasonable, and that's assuming no other catastrophes.
[22.04.11 - 16:53:25] [[h0p3]]: You have any other thoughts on the matter?
[22.04.11 - 16:53:52] [[h0p3]]: You've survived significant currency debasement before. I'm kinda worried this one will be unlike the others we've encountered.
[22.04.11 - 16:55:11] [[ASmith]]: DarkMX v1.24 is now available, released April 9, 2022
[22.04.11 - 16:55:51] [[ASmith]]: yes, Russia has many global connections which apparently the warplanners in the west didn't care about or know
[22.04.11 - 16:56:21] [[ASmith]]: Trump attempted the same with China but failed and their interconnectivity is enormous on global connectivity, imports, exports
[22.04.11 - 16:57:34] [[ASmith]]: the de-dollarization is rapidly continuing with weaponization of the USD Dollar by the Israeli Zionists, Federal Reserve, SWIFT Networks and USA Gov, its to much of a risk to nations for them to place $billions in USD in some zionist controlled foreign banks
[22.04.11 - 16:59:11] [[ASmith]]: I'm a regular shopper in the $Dollar stores and carefully gleen what is gone-gone due to inflation costs, quite a bit is gone and for many items the cost in the Dollar stores is now $1.25 a 25% raise however in the stores the amount in the regular package is also LESS even at a 25-30% increase in cost
[22.04.11 - 17:03:28] [[h0p3]]: Thank you, sir. I appreciate your time.
[22.04.11 - 17:03:57] [[ASmith]]: thanks, no problem, pass on what works, some views ahead, plow forward
