* Stunning!

*** Marvelous. Even in our disagreements: Bravo. This is clean and hard-hitting. I hate that I must take [[aim]] at Saint Kant. You have no idea. I'd like think he did it on purpose for us. Sly bastard. Take note of this wrestling, offspring. 

* Confirm My Bias

* Interesting

*** Hard to compete with proprietary on this front. It could be decades before EZ P2P DBs take root.

*** Perhaps completely irrelevant. There's some push-back in there. I know it's expensive to read one's enemies. At the very least, there's fodder in it for you, confirming your suspicions. Perhaps it's a place to practice playing the trickster and learning to price-efficiently negate.

*** If you go down the economics path, it would be worth finding contemporaries who do it right. We're out of my bailiwick (and I barely pay enough attention to popularity contests to know any big names at all in my own discipline).
