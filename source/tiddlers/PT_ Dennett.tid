* The idea of evolution by natural selection unifies the realm of meaning and purpose with the realm of mechanism and physical law.
* Reasons gradually emerged out of mere causes, 'what for's' out of 'how come's', with no 'essential' dividing line between them.
* There were reasons tracked by evolution ('free-floating rationales') long before there were reason-representers like us.
* Adaptationist reasoning is the heart and soul of evolutionary biology, it is not optional.
* Comprehension is not the source of competence; it is composed of competences, and it comes in degrees.
* Our intentionality is gradually derived from the intentionality of our "selfish genes", which is derived from the functional context of evolution.
* With 'the intentional stance' we can treat something as an agent without committing to hypotheses about its internal structures.
* Meanings and thoughts do not show up within physics, but are apparent within 'the intentional stance' toward complex agents.
* Minds are composed of simpler subsystems that are composed of teams of still simpler agents so stupid that they can be replaced by a machine
* There is not a finish line or a center (a 'Cartesian theater') in the brain where the content is "presented" to the conscious subject.
* A self is like a center of (narrative) gravity: an abstract object, a theorist's useful fiction - not a thing in the brain.
* All mental activity is accomplished in the brain by parallel, competitive processes of interpretation, under continuous editorial revision
* Consciousness is a system of user-illusions evolved to make versions of our cognitive processes accessible to us for purposes of communication.
* We can study consciousness objectively by getting the subjects' verbal accounts of their conscious experiences ('heterophenomenology').
* Qualia are in fact the intentional objects of mistaken beliefs that simply don't exist, anywhere.
* There might be variations of consciousness from poet to possum to protozoon, and no 'essence' of consciousness to discover.
* If the competence observed cn be explained without appeal to comprehension, we must not indulge in extravagant anthropomorphism for animals.
* Memes turned our brains into minds capable of dealing with ideas, thanks to the apps installed in our 'necktops'
* Brains are computers, but they are very unlike the computers in use today.
* Unlike our computers and flip-flops, organisms and neurons are competitive agents; this may be their key difference
* Brains are more like termite colonies than intelligently designed corporations or armies.
* The traditional view of free will, as a personal power isolated from physical causation, is both incoherent and unnecessary as a grounds for morality.
* Free will (like colors, dollars, promises) is part of the user-illusion of the manifest image that we shouldn't want to dismantle; it's where we live.
