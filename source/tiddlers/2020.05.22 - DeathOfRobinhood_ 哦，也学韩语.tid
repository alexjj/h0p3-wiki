Wo ye yao xue xi han yu!

I wish I was fluent in Mandarin too! When I was a kid, I spent my Sundays in Chinese school, but I've lost much of it from disuse. My mom is Peranakan Chinese and speaks many dialects, but we haven't conversed as much in Mandarin as either of us would have liked. Would love to do a refresher with you over the phone from time to time if you're ever up for it :)
