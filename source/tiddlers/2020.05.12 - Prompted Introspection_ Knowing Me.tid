title: 2020.05.12 - Prompted Introspection: Knowing Me

!! What are things that you wish people knew about you without your having to tell them?

Indeed, this is a striking question for this wiki and myself.<<ref "b">> Interestingly, almost [[Relic]]ably, [[2018.10.07 - Prompted Introspection: Without Having to Tell Them]] is correct: I have had to cull [[Generic Prompts]]. It's been a long time coming. I'm excited to see the monstrosity I've built slowly shift. Go forth.

I have a hard time answering better than I did. I'll add that I wish there things I could know about myself without me having to tell myself as well, but sometimes that's why I have to figure out what I need to write down. I would also like to generate the specifics that would normally be intended by this question.

I need people to know that I'm not neurotypical, that I'm basically crazy by many standards (even if I code like I'm not for a long time with them). I've danced this one too many times for so long that I have basically given up most of my [[hope]] of even finding offline companions that can actually handle me. I don't want to have to be reserved, calculating everything, and spending my spoons on surface bullshit (and capitalism selects for people who only live on the surface). I am tempted to say there is a lack of authenticity in such cases, but that's not clear to me on a second glance. No, instead I feel unduly alienated, which is different. 

I'm an expensive person to get to know, and that's damningly problematic in that I'm not usually worth getting to know. The first step for others getting to know me is that I'm a weirdo. Sometimes, if I can cut through at least some of their surprise up front, if they have the knowledge to predict that I won't match their usual predictions in some key places, then they'll have the energy and space to connect with me. I say this as someone who also fails tremendously, like a hypocrite.

I don't know what to do. I gotta find an answer for my offspring. I hate the thought that they will feel so alone.
