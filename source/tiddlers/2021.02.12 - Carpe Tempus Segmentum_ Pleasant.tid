title: 2021.02.12 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Pleasant

Up late Trying To Take Over The World. Disappointed. 

Absurd dreams. Far more dialogue than usual.

[[Morning Routine]], mounting the chinup/rowbar, exercise with the offspring. My left knee is wobbly, feels like it's gonna collapse, ACL, going easy.

Cleaning & Organizing

Planning with my bro, and hunting for a vehicle. He's feeling a lot safer. Good.

Bugging offspring.

My wife was exhausted, anxious, sore :P (wildly my preference), and she still had me throw it in her (I hope you walk bow-legged for days). God bless her. I like that my string of jokes made her lose her composure. I tend not to interrupt the pleasure, but we've simply been way more talkative than usual lately (I'm not talking about blasphemy and economics discussion foreplay here). I missed the chance to be naked in the shower with her (but still got to hold her while she peed [I'll get in trouble if I scoop it up, apparently]).

She handled a fuckup from SL well, and G's gesture with tech (I think he knew the answer, he was doing something else) was interesting (yet again, I am absolutely terrified that she is the most competent tech user among these people...we're all going to die - everyone is so fucking old there). Planning. I'm the loser, she's the winner. =).

[[Family Gathering]] was dope. Ribs, green beans, and a potato salad unlike any I've had before. We're getting spoiled. 

Offspring hacking away on their machines with required supervisory motivation (because I'm so tired of waiting). I am the worst, and I don't give a flying fuck. Those machines will be online, that list will be completed, your KVMs+mirroring will be set up, your battlestations will be fully operational, and so forth. At least their rooms are nominally functional.

Unfortunately, it was a scam. Still, we've found some other amazing deals for my brother. I'm surprised by how much shit he's getting done while he's supposed to be chilling. Yeah, I'm picking out things that have to be done, but I'm trying to say, "Hey, we have time." He's in go, go, go mode. 

Sorting Candy. Grown ass adults. Like money through our fingers. CBD too. Tried out my autist stim toys. Son was with us chillin' on his [[1uxb0x]]es. Moving back to Manjaro, had everything set all on his own lickety-split (good job, kid), including KVM (wish he would try on his own, like only I believe he can do it or some other mistake). He's got a tiny SSD. We'll see if that needs to be remedied (I'm a fan of learning to live in tight spaces though). We listened to music and had a guy-night. Not sure how to describe it. 

Checked in on my ᛝLightᛝ. Tempted as always, but not my place. She's bonding and kindling that flame. She's having fun tonight, and she needs it. You go, girl. Everything you got. Build your life with him. I'm cheering you on. Enjoy every moment. I know you know how to savor. I'm lapping up your wiki too, like a beggar.

A curious exchange from a stranger in [[ASmith]]'s largely anonymized IRC (the irony that we are still using IRC is not lost on us). He's obviously used to handling some abusive folks. I have a lot in common with him. Regularly offers humble advice too (and his rants are growing on me). I respect him beyond the respect I owe to dasein, and that is exceptionally rare for me. It's a treat.
