title: 2022.05.06 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Magic Invisible Hands of Stagflation

A third of the way through //Dune// (1984), and it was disgusting (except the parts that weren't). Sleep by 1?

Woke at 8:30. Meditation. Morning Routine. Dialectics with my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]]. Dialectics with my sympaticon. 

Sprayed a sealant on the outside tap. Gonna try to get the leak on the outside to lessen, as replacing it doesn't seem a worthy use of our resources. Mulch moved and spread. Sawing our dead trees to make a liner for the bed. The watermelon plants look amazing; we'll see if any actually work out.

Shopping @ Home Depot with my sympaticon. She picked up some plants and a hatchet (which may work better than a saw for some of our work). We picked up more mulch to finish the job. We met Greg. Greg doesn't trust people and faces some significant disadvantages. Carded. `/wave`. I [[hope]] you do stay in touch, sir.

Painting with my daughter in turns.

//The Walk// with my sympaticon in the drizzle. Bread and water. Excellent, honorable, hard dialectics.

//Capitalism: A Love Story// with my offspring and sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]]. I sharpened my sympaticon's hatchet and my large axe as we watched. Nice and sharp. Ready for action.

Chilled with mi amor for a bit.

Work on the rest of the mulch in the rain.

[[MTG]]. Her Gobbos +0 vs MWC. Went to 3 games, and barely took it, again. She's on fire.

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. //Inform the Men!// Shower of the gods!

Made dinner for me, my sympaticon, and mi amor. Burgers, stacked. Rye and italian, avocado, mayo, steak sauce, cheese, onions, lettuce, egg with yolk, spicy sweet pickles. Water. 

Mi amor and my sympaticon ate with me in [[The Den]]. It was dope. We watched leet fucking beetboxers, and the girls are learning to dogpile on their retard (I'm easy to trick). Good. As it should be. Still have my beads right here thinking about those I [[love]]. 

Dialectics with my sympaticon, a joyful kind. The octopus is on red.

XOXOs with everyone. Offspring will be up late playing with their friends, and mi amor with her book. I have diarrhea. `/thumbs-up`.

[[MTG]]. Her Gobbos +0 vs MWC. CBD + Vapelyfe. She destroyed me g1 and g3. Wasn't even close. =). Massage. Finishing //Dune//. 

Btw, heads up, stagflation is here. Hope it's transient, ofc.
