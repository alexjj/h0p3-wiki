How goes it?
Fri 10:18am
Do you end up making a lot of music with your husband?
Fri 10:18am
strangely enough, we have yet to really do so. he's played percussion/bass while I play a few times, just when folks were round the house (so, a long time ago now haha) ... there's the battle of stirling brig that we did round the fire this bealteann that he put on facebook ... when he's got his stuff properly set up he wants to record me doing my (at th emoment, only one original that's stuck after all this time) song... we'll see. He's asked me to do vocal stuff on his whatever-the-fuck-it-turns-out-to-be, and I might, but we'll see. I'm hesitant to work with. He's a nightmare micro-manager in real life; I'm not keen to get involved with him creatively that way! haha   

How are you guys? Weekend plans?

This weekend has been an attempt to help [[k0sh3k]] recuperate and get some time in with her. She's had a crazy week.

Your husband sounds like I am with my computer. I really like my computer a lot (though he is far more skilled in music than I am with my computer), and I don't think it's fun for anyone when they compute with me. [[k0sh3k]] doesn't really touch my computer (though my daughter has someone learned how to use it without much friction).
