Question to discuss:
I am a naughty asian slut, check out my reddit/OF: skyelikesitrough

Stranger: nah

You: This is stupid

You: You aren't.

You: Wish they found a way to detect bullshit for this.

You: Hard to do.

You: Do you like computers?

You: Should we check the link out?

You: https://www.reddit.com/user/skyelikesitrough

You: Definitely hawt.

Stranger: huh

Stranger: oh nice

Stranger: lmao i didnt realise you were sdtill here my bad

You: Reminds me of something I wrote today.

You: Naw, no problem. We're just strangers chillax.

You: Chillaxin*

Stranger: so truee

Stranger: ohh

Stranger: what'd you write today>

Stranger: you're a writer?

You: I have Geschwind Syndrome. I write enormous amounts every day.

You: Pertaining to the link in question, I wrote "Skintime + Tube. Inform the Men! Sweet baby jesus.j I feel a lot better. I'm a very, very simple man. Study the secrets of the universe: it's pussy. Meditation. TTTOTW."

You: https://philosopher.life/#2021.07.21%20-%20Carpe%20Tempus%20Segmentum%3A%20Coomthinkpilled

You: (my shorthand for my journal)

Stranger: woah i had no idea this was a thing

Stranger: i am intrigued

You: I'm full blown retard. AMA. Or, tell me about yourself. I already know more about myself than should be legal.

Stranger: lol

Stranger: i think you should be able to know yourself well, no?

Stranger: um! where should i start

You: Oh, no doubt, homie. One of my {[[Axioms]]}, in fact, is [[Know Thyself]]. https://philosopher.life/#Know%20Thyself

Stranger: as someone with severe art block whenever i have to do anything i'm almost envious of your power

You: What kind of [[art]] do you enjoy creating?

You: Why do you want to make it?

Stranger: but in a respectful way

You: I gotchu fam.

Stranger: to me it's usually an outlet

Stranger: like i just get these thoughts and i need to do something with them

Stranger: whenever i'm able to it's cathartic but that's not very often

You: What outlets seem to have the highest rates of success for you?

Stranger: it's tough, it changes a lot depending on my mood

Stranger: i love language and writing but i find it hard to write on command if that makes sense?

Stranger: i used to compose music as well but i've not done that in a good while

You: I can appreciate that. It's hard to feel comfortable saying some kinds of things too. Can be difficult to achieve that flowstate.

Stranger: exactly

You: No shit. What kind? How you do it?

Stranger: photography is probably my most successful art form at this point but it's a different beast in a way

You: Music is a special thing for me (https://philosopher.life/#Music%3A%20Library).

You: Oh, well, if you have any anonymous photos to show me, I'd like to see them.

Stranger: i kinda self-taught a bunch of musical instruments when i was younger, not to the point of being a virtuoso but enough to get the sounds out of things i wanted to at the time

You: Photography can be addictive, even just from a toolporn perspective.

Stranger: very true!

Stranger: sorry i'm kinda going on about three different things at once hahah

You: Ah, play by ear? Best musicians I've met began that way.

You: No, I don't mind. Keep as many threads as you want.

Stranger: photography fascinates me because unlike other art forms you can never really start with a completely blank sheet of paper

Stranger: it's interesting to be capturing the way i look at something rather than having to create a new world entirely from scratch as pretentious as that sounds

You: (I wonder what the most blank types of photography methods are available)

You: Doesn't sound pretentious to me.

You: I am not skilled in understanding the nature of [[art]], but to my eyes, one must have a strong point of view in whatever is being simulated.

Stranger: i agree!

You: Do you see yourself as pouring yourself out into the medium?

Stranger: my work is kind of eclectic but i post them on [[REDACTED]] if you're curious

Stranger: i do!

Stranger: it just makes sense to do somehow, i'm not sure how to explain it

You: It's gorgeous.

You: You'll have to forgive me for being such a poor interpreter of art, poetry, and so forth. It certainly evokes strong emotions.

Stranger: thanks so much!

Stranger: personally i don't think it matters how good of an interpreter you are, especially not in the classical sense

You: Oh shit, source code has dope ass ASCII art at the top.

Stranger: ha, it does

Stranger: wish i could say that was me but i had some help with the website

You: mine does too, though it's not meant for anyone but Google^^tm^^ and so forth.,

You: Basically everything I use on my [[computer]] is borrowed, stolen, cribbed, remade from other generous people.

You: Even my ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî± is a Tiddlywiki (https://tiddlywiki.com).

You: Why build it all from scratch and by ourselves? Cooperation and [[sharing]] generates so much more.

Stranger: i'd never heard of tiddlywiki before! it seems like quite a useful tool

You: It's insane. I've tried a lot of software in my days (like only a true 'tist could), and this one is [[magic]] to me.

Stranger: it's always nice to find something that works juust right for you :)

You: Hellls yeah.

You: What things "just werk" for ya? (go hog wild on pickin' things out)

Stranger: i hope you don't mind me getting lost on your site later, it's all so interesting yet different from what i'm used to ha

Stranger: usually the simpler a tool is the more likely i am to keep using it

You: Oh, well, it's a blackhole. It's about 80 100k-word novels wrapped inside a single html file. Feel free to HMU anytime, btw (https://philosopher.life/#Contact%20h0p3). I speak with some [[people|Find The Others]] at great length (hundreds of pages even).

You: Elegance!

You: Does it do one thing well, hit that spot?

Stranger: the camera i use is one i picked out because it's as simple as possible rather than being covered in screens and buttons, for example

You: Oh, what camera?

Stranger: it's a fujifilm x-pro3! pretty much the closest you can get to shooting an old camera without having to get an old camera

You: That's a serious fucking camera.

Stranger: it is! one of the most expensive things i've ever bought myself just for the purposes of using for art i think

You: May it last you a lifetime.

Stranger: thank you! i started out on a hand-me-down that was made in the 70s and it's what's felt 'right' to me ever since

Stranger: didn't even use a battery, you just had to wind it up beforehand and know what you're doing

Stranger: but after a while, and i know this is a cliche thing to say, it kind of becomes an extension of your hand after you get so used to it

You: Did you ever develop your own film?

Stranger: i used to when i started out! part of me wishes i still had the resources to

You: It is easier to become virtuous with an elegant tool in many cases, have it become an extension of our identities and forget that we are even wielding it, focusing on the task.

Stranger: definitely a very different experience but quite a nice one

Stranger: right!

You: I prefer digital photography in the end anyway. I like how price-efficient it can be in the long-run.

Stranger: me too! convenience-wise it's hard to beat

Stranger: film is wonderful but it has its flaws, especially when traveling

You: I don't take many pictures. It's a very rare thing. I'm a shy person in many respects. But, my wife takes a bunch (and I'm [[grateful]]).

You: Where have you traveled to?

Stranger: you'll be amused to know that despite being a photographer, i'm very camera shy myself

You: A worthy irony.

Stranger: it's made me more observant of my surroundings i think, both practically and historically

You: That makes sense.

Stranger: i don't consider myself to be of great importance but one day i'll be gone yet my work will remain for others to be seen

You: Hunting for what is [[salient]] about your place in The World.

Stranger: exactly!

Stranger: i don't mean to sound all pretentious but

You: I think that is one of our fundamental tasks as persons.

Stranger: to leave a mark, hopefully a positive one

You: What do you about the concept of morality?

Stranger: or to influence someone's life in some good way

You: What do you think*

Stranger: morality? hmm

You: (I can't English, btw, you get my schizospergs)

Stranger: haha you're fine dw

Stranger: morality is tough because it's so subjective by nature

You: Do you hope to leave an objectively positive mark on the world or in lives of [[others]]?

Stranger: it'd be nice i think

Stranger: it's easy to fall into a trap of selfishness and only do it to make yourself seem like a better person

Stranger: but at the same time if it means someone ends up doing good, maybe that's not so bad after all

Stranger: that's a slippery slope, though

You: Aye, vicious virtue signaling, narcissism...I don't think psychological egoism is necessary, btw. I know we can be better.

Stranger: agreed

You: There's something to be said for faking it until one makes it. But, yeah, ultimately, if one does not choose do what is right because it is the right thing to do, to choose to act from duty, it lacks moral merit.

Stranger: exactly, yeah

Stranger: you have a much better way with words than i do, haha

You: Oh, thank you. Those are words I've studied for a long time. I used to teach philosophy.

You: How do you survive in the world?

Stranger: right now i'm still living the uncertain life of a university student

You: Ah. I hear that.

You: It's a transformative experience.

You: Are you getting enough to eat?

Stranger: luckily, i am

You: `/salute`.

You: What are you studying?

Stranger: the future slightly worries me but i suppose i should be worrying on my present first

You: Oh, I hear that. Lmao.

You: Turns my stomach inside and out.

Stranger: right now i'm studying communication and information sciences which i believe is just a fancy way to say 'linguistics, PR and some basic internet stuff'

Stranger: i've flip flopped on what i've actually wanted to do more times than i probably should have in the past but i'm hoping this'll be the one

You: That major set firmly in stone for you?

You: It's okay. You are supposed to change your mind.

You: Do you study formal linguistics? Do you learn marketing with the business students? What kinds of internet stuff (be as technical as you wish)?

Stranger: i've dabbled in cognitive science and law before this. both interesting topics but neither really felt like a calling to me, hence the switch

Stranger: I don't think it'll be super specialised in any one particular field, but that might not be a bad thing

You: My wife's a librarian (a route I almost went). If you go for a masters, an MLIS might be a relatively simple step for ya.

Stranger: that's always seemed like an interesting line of work to me as well

You: A vocation.

You: Serving others.

Stranger: i've no idea where i'd start with that though (other than being well read haha)

You: Oh, most librarians I've met are not the "quickest" crayons in the box (though, I've met my fair share of extremely talented ones too). It never hurts to be well-read for many reasons, obviously.

Stranger: ha right

You: Volunteer some at the library. Work at the one at your university maybe.

Stranger: I might just do that!

You: You'd apply to library school in your Fall semester (hard to find a free ride, but it can be done).

You: Senior Fall*

Stranger: certainly something to keep in mind!

Stranger: To answer your question about my current study, there's a lot about the art of influencing someone and the choices they make

You: No doubt. Rhetoric, formal reasoning, empirical epistemic justifications.

You: I'm a student of [[memetic warfare]] and dark-triadicism. It's expensive to think about.

Stranger: i can imagine!

Stranger: much like with my previous studies it makes me slightly uncomfortable knowing a lot of these things can very easily (probably already are) used for more malicious stuff

You: Ugh. Yeah. =/.

You: Gives me the willies.

Stranger: but at least in this instance i'd at least be able to fight fire with fire somewhat (hopefully)

Stranger: the cognitive science study i did before this also had a reasonably heavy focus on AI which was both fascinating and slightly terrifying

You: That is the [[hope]]. It's difficult to do when capitalism is only going to pay you to influence minds in an exploitative manner.

You: [[Aispondence]] may be worth your time.

You: What did you learn about AI?

Stranger: i'll have to look that up, thanks!

You: I'm a dabbler in these topics. Definitely interested.

Stranger: my main takeaway was how it actually reflects back on us as humans in a way

You: Like it's our narcissistic mirror slave?

You: We train it with [[bias]].

Stranger: since an AI only does what it's told to do to the best of its abilities the way we teach it and the things we teach it can impact the results it produces quite a bit

Stranger: right exactly

You: Seems like a very expensive problem to solve in a world in which those who won't be moral will always have the competitive advantage.

Stranger: see also all those AI chat bot experiments people tried where the internet turned them into hate filled nazi-esque creatures in the span of a couple of days

You: Aye.

You: GPT-3 didn't seem to have the same problems (though it can be re-directed like a misinformation cannon, possibly).

You: What do you think is going to happen? Wild guesses, even.

Stranger: i also think it's partly the way society overestimates AI at the moment, the average person thinking it makes far more informed decisions than it usually actually does

You: It's hyped, no doubt.

Stranger: the overreliance on underdeveloped AI is something that could get pretty serious in the near future i feel

You: There are classes of problems is solves well, but it's difficult describe to the average person what those are. Most people lack the necessary computer literacy to appreciate the abstractions and functions at stake.

You: "You're fired!"

You: "We aren't hiring you because the blackbox said not to."

Stranger: humans love seeing patterns in things that don't have patterns, but now we have machines that are orders of magnitude better at spotting patterns, whether they're actually there or not, with very little in the way of checking how they might have come to that conclusion

You: "We'll add more police forces here because the computer told us to"

Stranger: right

Stranger: i don't really fear a singularity-type event because the tech simply isn't there yet for something like that

You: I'm probably about twice your age. I was highly doubtful any of what has come to pass in this field would come to pass at your age.

Stranger: but that doesn't mean that with a little help from some humans we could do some pretty big damage

Stranger: or some pretty amazing things if you'd rather be very optimistic about it

You: That we know of*. Presumably, the most leet attempts are secret until they know it's more valuable to share its existence.

You: I'm not optimistic about who own the means of production in this case.

Stranger: i have to agree with you there

You: I don't predict a singularity-type event in my lifetime either.

You: AGI/ASI, not so much. But, I am convinced that ML is already shaping the world, and we're not even remotely competent with the methods we have now, to my understanding.

Stranger: that's my big worry too

You: I suggest the Chinese government has the best dataset available for building some of the most dangerous weapons I can think of.

You: They don't employ the best workers in the world. Yet.

Stranger: feeding incomplete or even inaccurate information into a black box and hoping for the best doesn't exactly give me a ton of hope

You: Oh, I think feeding it complete and accurate information can be extremely scary too.

Stranger: oh definitely

You: (one of my goals is to eventually ML my ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±, as it is probably the longest piece of writing from a single person in history...but, I have doubts that it will sound much like me...I've seen people do it with fractions of the corpus that I've got)

Stranger: it could get close, but you'd probably be able to tell the difference still

You: Oh, yeah, I'm counting on it. =).

Stranger: things are actually advancing pretty quickly in the world of language-based machine learning though so who knows

You: My favorite uses of text-based ML has been cherry-picking. If I can get it close enough, I'll just walk through streams of things that I might possibly have said to pick out what I want to say, at least as one of my logs.

Stranger: could be a very interesting way to deal with writer's block

You: There's this feller, his name is [[gwern]], I may eventually reach out to him again about it.

You: I'm hoping that it would be close enough that it might make inferences on my behalf.

You: I keep an extensive [[Link Log]] too, and I'm hoping it could help me sift the internet for links that I would find interesting.

Stranger: i wonder if we'll ever have to worry about any ethical/ownership issues stemming from that sort of thing

You: Well, my work is free to anyone. But, I think you mean more generally. What concerns do you have in mind?

Stranger: we're probably very far away from it still but if companies can legally be considered a person (i realise these are two different things but still) maybe we'll one day reach the point where AI and the work that it does has to be recognised as its own thing with separate rights and privileges that we're not allowed to mess with as humans

You: (I think the best liquid democracy voting systems would be based upon MLed representations of us to automated real-time digital voting systems. Running the model can be done [[private]]ly, but the initial formation of the model takes so much compute, there's no way unless we find more computationally-efficient methods for distributing it...there's some [[hope]] there, but I'm doubtful).

Stranger: i'm not really explaining my point very well haha but

You: Oh, I see.

You: There is a quasi-legalized DAO in the states. Could hand certain kinds of voting rights on a blockchain over to an AI kind of oracle.

Stranger: an AI oracle!

Stranger: that'd be something

Stranger: you're probably right too

Stranger: i've honestly not fully hashed it out in my head yet but

You: I think long before we can achieve AGI, "dumb" ML wielded elegantly will simply empower some particular corporate bodies to the point where they hold absolute advantage.

Stranger: one of those 'if this art/product/idea was created by no one, who should really be considered its owner' moral dilemmas

Stranger: your suggestion is probably what'd end up happening though yeah

You: I don't believe intellectual property rights can be justified.

You: https://philosopher.life/#2014.11.10%20-%20Challenges%20in%20Quasi-Lockean%20Intellectual%20Property%20Theory

Stranger: in general? that's a very interesting angle

You: (only if you are extremely bored)

Stranger: ooh i'll definitely be bookmarking this

Stranger: i know i'm jumping all over the place again but the more i think about this stuff the more i realise how a lot of societal values most people currently consider normal could very well fall apart completely if nothing's done to change them in the near-ish future

You: And, it's clear that some of our values must be wrong, since we're obviously headed in the wrong direction.

Stranger: you're not wrong there

You: We've got huge fucking problems to solve in a relatively short period of time.

Stranger: i consider myself reasonably optimistic but the idea i've gotten so far is that (at least over here) the current people in power don't seem to be in much of a rush at all

You: [[Power]] tends to centralize, exacerbating principal-agents problem. It's a hard problem to solve.

Stranger: it sure is

You: Give up on the boomers. They've spent your generation inheritance on themselves, failed to plant trees whose shade they will never know.

You: I can't say that I'm so convinced that when the Millennials eventually take power that it will be sufficiently better.

Stranger: i tend to flip-flop a lot between wishing i should have kept studying law to get into politics and hopefully making some changes to thinking i dodged a bullet by not choosing to solve some of the hardest/ most deeply rooted problems we've seen in a good while

Stranger: not that i'd have a grand plan that would fix everything but

Stranger: it's like the more i learn the more worried i get sometimes hahah

You: If ignorance is bliss, knowledge is agony.

You: Especially when we consider our own responsibilities, forced to fix mistakes we didn't even make.

You: I'm glad you haven't gone into law.

Stranger: getting stuck with the worst of two worlds has never been so easy

Stranger: ha, me too

You: I only know one that's worth a damn, and he's a public defender.

Stranger: i don't think i'd be able to keep going very long if i did

Stranger: it's... much more draining than i thought it'd be at first

You: Very high rates of sociopathy in that field too. Hard to be moral in such a field. Burnout fo sho.

Stranger: yeahh

You: If you don't mind me asking, but what did your parents do for money?

Stranger: nothing too glamorous ha

You: I'm a professional basement dweller, a neckbeard among neckbeards, a hikikomori. I have no glamour. Concrete floors for me. =).

Stranger: my father was a restaurant worker, my mother was a hospital secretary i think the word is?

You: Doing real work.

Stranger: she sat at a desk and took phonecalls and did paperwork for the most part

Stranger: ended up retiring early cause of back problems sadly but it seemed like a job to be proud of

You: I bet she came to understand much about the world through that job.

Stranger: as un-flashy as it might be

Stranger: i assume so

Stranger: looking back on it she's had a decent amount of low-level jobs in reasonably important places

Stranger: before that she had a job at the treasury which she's never told me anything about because she's legally not allowed to i think?

You: whoa, nifty

You: I'm surprised she's not allowed to say anything.

Stranger: i believe she handled a lot of minting and printing-related stuff so that might've had something to do with it

You: Ah.

Stranger: but this is mostly me recollecting childhood memories so i could be wrong too hahah

You: Why'd she up leaving it?

You: she end up*

Stranger: I should ask her about it again some time, I doubt she had to keep every single thing there a secret

Stranger: honestly i'm not entirely sure

Stranger: might have just wanted to be in a different field

You: Well, hospital job sounds better to me anyway. She alleviated suffering, saved lives, brought new ones into the world.

Stranger: i can imagine having to deal with lots of security-related red tape gets tiring if it's not for something you're passionate about

Stranger: oh yeah definitely

You: How about your dad? What kind of work in the restaurant?

You: Can the man cook?

Stranger: he works as a cook at the restaurant but amusingly he barely ever cooks at home

Stranger: keeping private life and work separate i guess

You: I know some chefs who eat absolute garbage on their own time and dime. They are like..."naw...fuck that".

Stranger: hahah right

Stranger: it's different when it's for someone else

You: Indeed.

You: Living for others makes life worth living.

You: You got yourself any SOs?

You: You think you'll ever have kids?

Stranger: don't know if i'll ever have kids

Stranger: wouldn't surprise me either way to be honest ha

You: Wide open. That's a talent.

Stranger: it's a touchy subject for a lot of people so i won't dwell on it much but i'm still trying to figure out what label (if any) i should put on myself regarding who i like and what i identify as and all that stuff so who knows

Stranger: like with so many other things the more i know the more i find out about how little i actually know

Stranger: so i might have a totally different view on things 5 years from now haha

You: I hear that.

You: I'd like to recommend using Mushrooms or LSD at 25, once your frontal lobes have developed, give you one more hard push in your openness and an epistemic reset and connection with some hard places in the human condition.

Stranger: looks like i've got two more years to prepare myself :)

You: `/salute`.

You: If you don't mind me asking, do you have any links for me?

You: I'm a linkslut.

Stranger: anything in particular you're looking for?

You: Like your photography, I seek links that pick out what you find [[salient]] about The World, on whatever networks you think I should explore.

You: Any topics are fine with me. Nothing is off limits.

Stranger: hmmmm

Stranger: i'll have a look! i fear i may have to disappoint you though

You: Naw, don't worry. Only if strikes ya. Not a problem.

You: What do you like to read?

Stranger: i'm not on the internet (especially off the beaten path) nearly as much as i used to be nowadays. might be technology/internet culture overload or something

You: Quarantine significantly alter your life?

Stranger: which is funny because i say that, knowing full well i've spent many more hours getting lost on wikipedia than i have reading actual books

You: Wikipedia's dope, yo.

Stranger: i've always been an inside person so it's not affected things that much other than making me fear the outside more haha

Stranger: do slightly miss going to concerts but not enough to the point where i'm happy to stand in the middle of a sea of people again

You: I don't read through many books these days.

Stranger: same here

Stranger: whenever i do, it's usually on a story i was already looking for that someone happened to write a book about

You: How do you find the stories you are looking for?

Stranger: a band member talking about their life on the road, a tech worker on how they designed some piece of technology, etc - lots of biographies and nonfictional descriptions of notable events

Stranger: it really depends, honestly

Stranger: sometimes it's just a google or wikipedia search away, sometimes it's from a news article i've read, often it's just because of a topic that came up while talking to someone i'd like to know more about but i don't know if there's much of a pattern to it

Stranger: i have the gift of being able to soak up lots of fairly useless knowledge it seems haha

You: A useful talent, no doubt. It's hard to know what will ultimately end up be useless too.

Stranger: very true

Stranger: i know this is silly but part of me wishes i was more articulate so i could delve into some of the things we've discussed a bit more still

You: We have time.

You: Seriously, mull it over, write it up. I work hard to think about what people say to me, and openly at that.

Stranger: there's always a thousand and one thoughts floating around inside my head but once it's all funneled through it tends to fall apart as soon as i consciously start thinking about it

Stranger: i noticed, and i appreciate it!

You: I have that problem. Ten Thousand Things.

You: It's a pleasure to meet you ([[REDACTED]], right?). I'm h0p3.

Stranger: it is!

Stranger: pleasure to meet you too, h0p3

Stranger: maybe it's an age/perceived intelligence thing as well but i almost feel like i'm not smart/articulate enough to fully utilise those brain cycles of yours ha

Stranger: but that may well be me overthinking things as i often do

Stranger: trying to make sense of the world is a tricky thing

You: Ah, you'll have to forgive me. I'm developmentally challenged in many respects. There's high variance in me.

You: Everyone who gets to know me well knows that I'm retarded in some crucial ways.

You: I'm happy to form whatever connections we can.

Stranger: me too!

Stranger: i don't get to do much non-small talk so it's nice to be able to think out loud for a bit

You: [[Smalltalk]] kills me inside.

You: [[Intimacy]] is almost everything to me.

Stranger: agreed

Stranger: i'm slightly impressed you managed to figure out my name without me telling you haha

You: Oh, I startle some people that way. Walks in the park with strangers, and I'll begin talking about the stories of their lives with them.

Stranger: hahah

Stranger: sounds like a fun superpower to have

You: I'm very [[lucky]] to meet the people I do.

Stranger: i could say the same honestly

You: It's rare that I meet someone on omegle that can stand speaking with me for very long.

You: I don't come here often. But, I probably should.

You: How often you come here?

Stranger: maybe once a week or so? depends

Stranger: i couldn't sleep tonight so i thought i'd kill some time on here

You: How does it usually go for you?>

You: I hear that.

Stranger: it's now 8:20 am so i guess i managed to do that at least lmao

Stranger: lots of quick disconnecters and horny people and what not on here

Stranger: i'm sure there's plenty of diamonds in the rough looking for people to talk to but at the same time there's a lot of... less patient people to go through first

You: Yes. Without having any skin in the game, most [[anon]]s abuse the privilege. They fail the [[Ring of Gyges]] test.

You: Btw, I'll be keeping our conversation here (with all the internal links too): https://philosopher.life/#2021.07.22%20-%20Anonymous%3A%20Nemo

Stranger: ooh

You: I'm the sort of person who re-reads my [[Chatlog]]s. It's how I interpret my relationships, make sure my paranoia is kept in check, that I'm being fair, etc.

Stranger: oh gosh this has been a long conversation hasn't it

Stranger: i almost feel bad you'll have to go through it all hahah

You: It's been an honor and a pleasure.

You: My family will read it during [[Family Time]] too, and [[others]] as well.

You: (we all keep wikis, and we read them on Sunday together, talk about it)

Stranger: I just hope I didn't accidentally say something embarassing someone might use against me ten years from now ha

You: `/wave` to you losers out there! =)

Stranger: Ah, the joys of the digital age

You: Indeed.

Stranger: i think staying up all night is finally starting to catch up on me so i should probably be heading off soon too ha

You: I'm beat too.

You: [[Hope]]fully, it won't be last we get to see of each [[other]]. TTYL, homie.

Stranger: see you around!

You have disconnected.
