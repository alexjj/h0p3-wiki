title: 2021.08.31 - Prompted Introspection: A Centrist's Question?

//Talkin' to the madman in the desert here. Many people despise talking with me about this topic, but that's one of the reasons why most people don't talk to me for long or with any depth. This is a core topic with me (also, these last bunch of [[Prompted Introspection]]s have been more technical than usual).//

!! Can someone both be a kind person and also hold the exact opposite of your political views?

XD. Not from what I can see, or it seems highly unlikely. If it's only nearly opposite, especially if they've just recently bound themselves to the initial kernel of The Moral Law without having fleshed out its concept (wherein we should hedged-conservatively particularize the notion of kindness at this stage), including the proceeding political obligations, knowledge, and perspectives,<<ref "n">> then: perhaps (we can talk about the habituated stability requirements of the virtuous character, if you wish), but not for long if they do,<<ref "i">> as even partial [[good]] [[faith]] attempts at epistemic closure (part of the meaning of holding that kernel, the CI) entail resolving conflicts, propagating the implications of beliefs, and updating one's desires and belief system to something quite similar.<<ref "b">>

My political views are fairly extreme and pointy;<<ref "tr">> I don't know anyone else who holds them all (though I have [[hope]] that there are some) due in part to the breadth of knowledge required (though I often find people who hold key sections, and plenty with more depth and accuracy than I will ever achieve).<<ref "k">> My political theory is fundamentally in virtue of efficient, liquid, timely attempts to convert, legislate, enforce, and adjudicate an iterated intersubjective representation and application of The Moral Law ([[WINTCIS]]). Where else will you find justification for the state, statesman? Kindness and [[Love]] must be the basis of The City. To deny it is immoral, unloving, and unkind, and to oppose it radically is psychopathy taken as far as I know how to define it. 

Note that the person could be kind to some [[dok]], especially as I don't take myself as having found the perfect<<ref "f">> theory in opposition to dark-triadicism (despite my best efforts). Presumably, the exact opposite provides a space here. On that note, even Hitler probably had some [[dok]] of kindness in him. Obviously, he's not a sufficiently kind person.

Again, we are political creatures; that's part of our essence (even if we don't self-identify as such), and the vast majority of adults I encounter are evil people.<<ref "o">> Samwise, if you aren't working and taking serious risks for the lives of the kids on the other sides of the planet who lost their [[moral luck]] roll and who have jackshit:<<ref "q">> you're a bad person. Period. Most people in my radius really don't give a fuck about anyone but themselves (and instrumentally sometimes a quasi-local tribe that they believe protects their happiness, with a hefty dose of rationalization) in the ultimate analysis.<<ref "t">> I am [[grateful]] to know there are good people in the world. It gives me [[hope]], however slim. 

I meet tons of polite, apparently [[civil]], nice people. That's usually nothing more than [[a mask|2021.08.27 - Prompted Introspection: For we all fall short...]]. Those appearances have so little to do with fruits of //kindness//, which is about [[loving|Love]] [[Humanity]], persons, as oneself, as ends in themselves. It's not about some local set of warm fuzzies when people around the world (and future generations) are suffering. Kindness without fitting priorities isn't kindness. Kindness is sacrificial, [[WINTCIS]]. It hurts. 

Obviously, I'm still learning about the nature of kindness, and the ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî± has its limits here too.<<ref "l">>

As I said, I'll only ever be the jester in [[his|WWDD]] almighty court. I'm not [[power]]less, but god damn, I look at the mountain and don't see even a remotely viable path. I'm just frantically wandering (in a highly privileged position) at this point. I think I'm going to lose my mind in pursuit of this thing.

I'm even in full hail mary mode here, trying to write to some possible future [[AI|Aispondence]] as one of my audience members; that's how low the odds of success are to my eyes. `/so-you're-tellin-me-there's-a-chance`.">>
