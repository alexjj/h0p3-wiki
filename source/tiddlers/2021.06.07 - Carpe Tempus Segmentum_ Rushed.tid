[[TTTOTW]], ofc. =). Have the water containers set for cleaning and filling (I'm missing one of the big blue containers...). Laundry. Many hugs and maybe (aww yiss). [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! Laundry. Sleep by 5?

Woke at 1. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! 

It's getting way hot. Not Thailand or New Orleans hot, but anything above 80 is hot for me. Underwear. 

[[Family Time]] was awesome, with one hiccup with my daughter (we recovered quickly enough). Everyone had plenty to read and talk about. Only [[k0sh3k]] didn't struggle to finish mine; there was a lot (and it was a joy to see their faces in the maymays and [[vidya]]s). 

Made dinner with my wife. Thick Asian noodles with softboiled eggs and various fruits and berries. We sat at the table for a long time. 

[[ASmith]] may be moving to libera as well. Aight. 

Laundry, a frozen pizza, [[TTTOTW]].

//Anomalisa//, more laundry, [[TTTOTW]], [[FTO]]. Sleep by 5.

Woke at 11:30. 

//Lightning Struck//. Etherpad seems pretty great to me. 

//The Walk// with my offspring. It was great. Talked about the book my daughter finished, she criticized Karma, and we walked through my poor understanding of the history of this concept in multiple cultures as it relates to The Moral Law. They both finished //Othello//, so I had them walk me through it (I don't remember nothing). My son was obviously emotionally-drained, but he did his best (my son has excellent self-control in this regard). My daughter's flipflops were eating into her, so I gave my shoes. We've come across the same fellow many times on our walks (I'm the one who is always on the walk, my partners change). Joe's his name. Thinking about moving to TN, moved up from Ft. L. to his parents house, 45, recently divorced. That's two houses now with profound alcoholism (saw at least fohty fifths of vodka in the recycling bin). Warned me to keep everything locked in this area (though also said it was calm), talked about the bars worth visiting, clearly racist, ex-chef (culinary school too) but allergic to flour, construction work, some hard living you can see. Maybe we can get together (seemed like he'd be down for it). He was ultra polite to me; this is the fourth time we have crossed paths, and I'm glad he didn't mind that we stopped to talk. His neighbor came out to join us on the street. Impromptu fellowship. May I be useful to my homies. His ride came, and he told me to stop by for anything (truly a southerner at heart). It started raining, but we decided to keep going on the long route. I'm feeling good about their wrestling with //Othello//, a lot better than the dumb motherfucker I was at their age. 

//Skintime// + //The Office//. Cramps have not subsided. Kevin continues to use every ounce of his remaining power to frustrate; he will surely be remembered. She's exhausted, feels like she didn't do anything when really it's that she pushed and is blocked by bureaucracy today.

Shopping @ W-Entity with mi amor. We picked up fans, watermelons, chocolate, etc. We almost picked up at least one AC, but she wants to wait (and I admire that).<<ref "ac">> I need to start wearing my belt. No mask requirements. Good news is that it's record heat, and I saw a ton of titties today. Life is good. 

Finished off the emergency water supply with my son.

Made dinner with my offspring. My daughter hates being in the kitchen with me even more than she usually hates being in the kitchen (woman, get in the kitchen :P). Everyone is on their period, and I need to tone my rhetoric down goddamnit. XD.

[[Family Gathering]] was great. Tendies, wedges, watermelon, green beans, potato soup, and aqua. Wasn't long though. So fucking hot in the house. It's uncomfortable (even the den is feeling warm).

A match -0, +0, -0 IllMUC (I'm not a fan of the construction given the options, but it's obviously strong) vs his Clampfinity. G1, T2 plated flyer with no possible answer upon resolution (shackles can't grow that fast). G2 was slow on his end (w/FoW on clamp t1) and continued mana denial throughout the game, double shackles into stone, and accepted the scoop. G3, he missed his double disciple triggers on the 8 artifact sweep, but I decided it was a dumb mistake to not just concede. 

Chatted with [[AA]] a bit about computing for mechanical engineering for [[AG]]. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

Set up crontab for temporary etherpad, nohup (et al) is failing, but rofi hits the spot just fine.
