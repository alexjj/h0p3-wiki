title: 2021.03.06 - Herb Quine: DRAFT - Herb Quine Interviews Herb Quine Interviewing Herb Quine

//Somebody suh-lap me; I identify as identifying as this meme.<<ref "t">> Lawd, yes, the subhypertexting shoe fits, `/sigh`, lmao. This might be the gayest^^tm^^ shit I have ever read in my entire life. Shots fired, and my happy asshole is so tickled (r u even in, bro? [HIV is "The Virus" at the center of my maze]), I don't even know what to say about this (and, I've lost track of how long this has been going on), even after a dozen readings (and going back through a large section of my beloved [[kickscondor]] wall-of-text before daylight put me back in my coffin). Like many [[subtle works|2021.03.06 - kickscondor: A Verbal History of the Infinitely Printable Maze]] meant for the retarded children who can't read so good, `/squint`, I fear I'm the only one who knows this is amazing (beyond revealing my considerable ignorance even further, I fear dishonoring it even more!). Thank you, üî•spittin' fool.<<ref "i">> It's time I start owning and owning up to these. I adore you, [[Herb|https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/b199789c-046d-45bc-9b9c-fc737190d70e]]ert Mirror Quine, Esq., `/toast`, you ambiguously black-and-white so-and-so. Please slap me in the face with your dick, daddy: I crave it.//

[[Herb Quine Interviews Herb Quine|https://www.kickscondor.com/herb-quine-interviews-herb-quine]]

Some time ago, I had a reader send me a very curious e-mail. It was an interview that they had conducted. In fact, they had interviewed themself! At first, this was very puzzling.<<ref "[1]">> But, on some reflection, I realized what a gift this was! I don‚Äôt like my part of the interview very well anyway. This is the answer!

!!!!!! ''Herb Quine'': That sounds so self-centered. Jesus Christ, Herb(s) is sometimes the worst. Why did he/they do that? That seems so fucking rude! Do you feel like he used you as a mere sounding board? In any case, this is a fabulously interesting answer. I'm interested to see what we find between the lines. I'm still puzzled by it. How about you?

Also I can‚Äôt stress to you enough - ''THIS IS NOT FICTIONAL OR SOME KIND OF HOAX''. This is actually an e-mail I received of someone interviewing themselves. Feel free to contribute your own if you want to. I am beyond serious. I‚Äôm in some kind of state of eigenseriousness that goes by the street name of CAVE. AGED. CHEDDAR.

!!!!!! ''Herb Quine'': XD. I lost my shit here. Also, is it a skunky cheddar? What sort of cave did you have in mind? Does it slide down your throat better than dick cheese?

''''> Herb Quine enters the digichat.

!!!!!! ''Herb Quine'': Oh, god. `/sigh`. Not again. Hold onto ur butts, The Other Herbs are here. I'll handle this.

''Herb Quine'': You are invited to a house boat party at Ted Nelson‚Äôs place. What do you bring?

!!! ''Herb Quine'': A dozen balloons and a first edition of ‚ÄúLagos During The 80s - The Birth Of Competitive Knitting In An Era Of Overinsurance‚Äù by Lula Drury. Also, a pet hamster in case Werner Herzog shows up.

!!!!!! ''Herb Quine'': You don't know what I'm talking about, do you? He never does. I don't, but I know it's the wrong answer, Herb. Knitting is for dorks. Although, I know I would treasure knitted socks (everyone needs those), even if he would never wear them for fear of ruining them. There's too many things to bring to T-dawg's place. At the very least, I'd have to bring an eigensharpie to stick in his pooper so he could sign my hairy tits. Friendship nipple link rings too; I want to be bound to him forever. 

''Herb Quine'': Speaking of Werner Herzog, name at least one film missing in his filmography and how to fix this grave mistake with the help of a voucher for 53 free time machines minutes to be used for a single travel to a time before October 1995.

!!!!!! ''Herb Quine'': Willem DaFoe! That's the guy I couldn't think of...Do you think Herzog talks to god or some other such unique entity?

!!! ''Herb Quine'': Easy, the film in question would be the missing biopic of Mike Tyson focusing on his time as a scholar of Medieval Media Studies in the field of Carolingian Reality TV, played by Bruno Schleinstein and filmed entirely in Yiddish. How to use the time machine should be obvious enough.

!!!!!! ''Herb Quine'': `/squint`. False. Bears, Beets, Battlestar Galactica. Obviously, I don't know what I mean here either. I can tell you that //Mike Tyson Mysteries// are stellar. 

''Herb Quine'': More seriously now, why a pet hamster?

!!!!!! ''Herb Quine'': No you be serious! Hamsters are not bears.

!!! ''Herb Quine'':  Pet hamsters are the closest thing to miniature grizzly bears, a fact which is of course entirely unrelated to their remarkable characteristics as party animals (the hamsters, not the bears, though they might qualify, too‚Ä¶). The purpose of the hamster at Ted‚Äôs party is thus twofold: In the unlikely event that a discussion of Xanadu‚Äôs future turns into an attempt to establish the Seasteading Republic Of Hypertext, someone needs to keep the engines chugging along. And secondly, you need a fluent German speaker to reminisce about Wagner with Werner (coincidentally also the title of the longest running radio show in Nigeria‚Äôs Yiddish enclave).

!!!!!! ''Herb Quine'': 

''Herb Quine'': You walk down to the shore to buy a new edition of ‚ÄúLearning Perl‚Äù, as you do every Thursday. But when you reach the ice cube factory, you suddenly realize that Unicode is pointless. Sure, you can play quite a few nice little language games with all these emojis they keep adding, but the burrow only goes so far. And then you hit the parking lot of the Consortium‚Äôs reserved committee parking spaces and tumble head first onto the seat of a convertible. Which makes sense, I guess, until you realize that the wonderful weather of the bay area is no bueno for rhizomes and others of their ilk. They need constant watering, don‚Äôt they?

!!! ''Herb Quine'': Sorry, was there a question?

!!!!!! ''Herb Quine'': Yes. He asked, "They need constant watering, don't they?"

''Herb Quine'': Yeah, all right, enough with the rambling. Let‚Äôs get down to business. What‚Äôs your affiliation with the FBI and are you or have you ever been an agent engaged in any work of endeavor related to printables, convertibles, mazes or any combination thereof?

!!! ''Herb Quine'':  I can neither confirm nor deny the existence of the information sought. Also, classical logic is overrated and all these lying Cretan hipsters are not nearly as interesting as they think. If you ask me, and you just did, they are just lazy bums who came up with this lying-business as an excuse to get out of the real work of building tremendously beautiful walls like real Cretans do. These kids nowadays, let me tell you‚Ä¶

!!!!!! ''Herb Quine'': Those cretans. I wonder if when they suck their girlfriends' cocks, does it remind them of that IPA they tasted the other day?

''Herb Quine'': Dat / Hypercore / Beaker sure look very interesting, but aren‚Äôt they a technical solution to a problem of the medium? One great aspect of Fraidycat is that it doesn‚Äôt care how established or indie your chosen medium is, in a way it feels as if Fraidycat is rerouting and connecting existing media to extend and create new media. It doesn‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre Kylie Jenner or Ted Nelson, it doesn‚Äôt (much) care about the underlying technology, because it changes the topology of the existing pieces while not denying that centralized sub-parts of the network still exist. Is a more foundational project like Dat / Hypercore / Beaker orthogonal to that idea?

!!! ''Herb Quine'': I know I‚Äôm mostly answering rhetorical questions at this point, but this is one that I‚Äôm really not sure how to answer. I do love the spirit of Dat / Hypercore / Beaker, I am just a bit suspicious of any attempts to revive the good parts of the personal web without paying attention to why it became less important as a medium (the non-app-web, that is), because I would be hesitant to point to technical reasons. To me, IPFS and SSB in particular often look like solutions that fix all the underlying tech in a very admirable way, without really changing the medium that they are producing or favoring. A decentralized Facebook will still result in a medium very much like Facebook, just at a disadvantage because the technical forces can never be fully aligned with the forces of the medium.<<ref "[2]">> I do think that Dat / Hypercore / Beaker are not as susceptible in this regard and I really hope that they do not end up emulating existing media too much. But really, I don‚Äôt know, what do you think?

''Herb Quine'': Is the treasure hunt over? What are we supposed to do now? Wait for National Treasure III? IS THIS REALLY IT? What about CGI Youngface and all the hard shell kayaks that are still lying around in undiscovered places on the globe? What about annie dark?

!!! ''Herb Quine'': Yeah, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm equipped to answer this one. But damn, it was an amazing ride so far.

!!!!!! ''Herb Quine'': Yeah, I don't feel like I'm equipped to understand myself either. I love you. Do you like coloring books? I do.

<<footnotes "i" "And, Sir [[DeathOfRobinhood]] may also engage in this practice.">>

<<footnotes "[1]" "In an attempt to shed some light on what is going on here, this person DOES preface the interview with a note to me which reads: ‚ÄúI am writing you this electronic letter to defuse the somewhat bizarre situation of having sent you an unsolicited printable maze that perhaps put you in an awkward position. After all, how are you supposed to react to such a strange and perhaps unexpected offering from a stranger on the internet? Well, since the printable maze in question has already escaped into the tubular ether, there is no going back and we might as well get to know each other a little better, what do you say?‚Äù (That other e-mail is reprinted in [[A Verbal History of the Infinitely Printable Maze|https://www.kickscondor.com/a-verbal-history-of-the-infinitely-printable-maze]], for completeness‚Äô sake.)">>

<<footnotes "[2]" "Fine, fine, I‚Äôll cut in here. Can‚Äôt you lot just interview yourselves and gotdamn leave me out of it??...
I feel what you saying so acutely - making a distributed web is actually a minor change on the surface - who would notice? (And I‚Äôm levels down: not a zealot - I just think it‚Äôs fun.) But I think there are cascading effects. When the app and the data and the whole thing is on Facebook‚Äôs servers, that has implications. And when the app and the data and the whole are on home computers, that has implications...For me, Beaker DOES pay attention to the original good part: view source. It brings view source to the modern ‚Äòye-app-web‚Äô relevant part you speak of. That‚Äôs all.">>
