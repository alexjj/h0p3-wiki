title: 2022.07.11 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: CODEFAKE

<<<
//Westworld//. Sleep by 2?

Woke at 8:30. Meditation. Gump. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. My sympaticon left me tea and caffeine.

//The Walk// with my sympaticon. Difficult dialectics.

Put together the clothes rack for mi amor. I think this one will last. We'll see how the bars hold. If they bow too much, it might be a problem. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Finishing the letter. Vapelyfe.

//The Walk// with mi amor. She sunburned. 

[[Family Time]] @ 6. It took quite a while because we read [[2022.07.04 - The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum: â˜¯â˜‰]]. It's done. [[Grateful]] to those who put forth the effort to help me with my gibberish. Played my clarinet. I made pizza and sliced some watermelon. Watched another episode of //Good Omens//, and I stayed awake for it, ðŸ˜±. //Severance// is next, in a few months. 

Last 8 characters of my son's Read only key he sent me today: `CODEFAKE`. =D.

Put mi amor to bed. 

[[TTTOTW]]. [[D2]], chillin' with my sympaticon. Trying various TC84 areas on the necro at different settings. Given Iron Golem, I really can't push as hard as I'd like to. Regeared, stripping Sugar (yum) a bit, over 300MF on NeckRomancer now. Dropped summoner charms and dropped an SoJ for FCR/Prismatic/stat/MF to make up for putting Mara's back on. Barb might just be the last I can equip, as he needs assloads of high runewords to make reasonable. Hope is back in solid shape, minus an ammy that is just +2 (need two more levels for her crafted, but I really need +2/Mana Leech).

[[TTTOTW]]. Tried to sleep. No go. Fireman Time! [[D2]], crafted some blood amulets. Nothing much. Sleep by 2?

Woke at 6:30. Half-brained sleep, maybe. Couldn't really get back to sleep, but probably slippin' and out of consciousness. My sympaticon woke me. Time to get ready and go.

Chilled with my sympaticon at DSS. Told jokes and worked on [[NemoRevera]]'s [[letter]]. This DSS is largely barren (I'm used to way more kids and packed waiting room, so that was a pleasant surprise), with bursts of people ranging from extremely timid to surly shit about to real up in hur. The appointment they scheduled wasn't really an appointment but a staggering to get into the real queue. I'm glad we came early. This institution is well-staffed at the front-end, and everyone is kneejerk working to de-escalate: it's mechanically oldhat to them. I respect their politeness. Covid distancing is still operating here, and cleaning is regular (a lady told me not to worry, I wasn't in her way). I hear Italian, Portuguese, flavors of Spanish, dialectics of English, including a Jamaican accent that slaps (the point woman controlling the room heard him say "thank ya, ur a darlin'" to the receptionist, and she lept at the opportunity to ask him to fill out a customer service review form for her - she also helped him with his own forms though [asking the fitting questions in a gentle manner]). It's a shame that my Spanish has disappeared. As usual, walls and windows are plastered with posters, and there's more cameras than I'm used to seeing. One receptionist talked about her LLC, jumping state lines to avoid paying taxes, upgrading Zoomlinks for her dance instruction. No vulgar language notices only apply to clients. Many confusing [[smalltalk]] for something genuine. Many similar, classic stories from the people coming in about their interactions with DSS, and I don't know who to believe. People are desperate to reach people who are carefully protected by the frontlinebackers. The mind-numbing pace of paper-based government work. Several of the workers are confused about what I'm doing here, observing and typing (I am disconcerting); the rule about cell phones doesn't seem to apply except when they want to apply it, `/nod`. [[TTTOTW]]. I was allowed to come back with my sympaticon when she filled out her review. Gleaned what I could. There are multiple people who work multiple jobs here.

Burgers with my sympaticon. Cashier must have thought we were something else, I think. Thought about what steps were left to take. Paperwork is going through though! A story about an RPed market inside a church and flipping tables like Saint Jesus.

Assignments. Attic needs organizing. Dadnap. Hard. Woke at 3:30? [[TTTOTW]]. [[D2]] + //Ender's Shadow// with my sympaticon. Crafted around 50 blood amulets (been stockpiling ingredients for a long time). 5 +2, Prismatic, etc. Pulling ammies stronger than Mara's is a treat. Didn't find ML +2 Ass, but did LL, two actually. Just need to hit 89. Jill now wields SoJs (may switch to Bul-Kathos). It's so weird not to want to use them on the rest of my casters. Moved Aegis Spirits onto her, upped her remaining jav, and dropped all pretense of defense. She avoids or she dies, full glass canon, and the only safe way to run cows. Picked up socketables.

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. Shower of the gods! //Skintime// with mi amor.

[[Family Gathering]] was delicious. We had fishsticks, tatertots (extra seasoning too), and watermelon. Smashed it. //Stranger Things// 2 episode. Barely rewatchable. I'm sad. Thing loses its luster. We had a good time though, and it was chill.

//Ender's Shadow// @D9T06:04:00. My sympaticon fell asleep, as she predicted. `/nod`. [[TTTOTW]]. Put mi amor to bed. Chilled with my son for a while. Said his day was neutral and productive, with socializing. Hope he keeps it going. Many plates to start spinning up here soon, ideally. Still feeling the pain of the sunburn. [[TTTOTW]].

//Skintime// + //The Boys// with my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]].
