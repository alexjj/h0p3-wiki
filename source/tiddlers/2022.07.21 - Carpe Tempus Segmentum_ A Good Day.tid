title: 2022.07.21 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: A Good Day

Woke at 8:30? It was enough. Gump. Meditation. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

Assignments. My eye-lid hurts. Might be another infection. Other folks having lots of allergies. Cleaned my face mask. Once every 2-3 years should be fine, right?

Sammiches with my sympaticon. Talked with a dude who has a 2 and 13 yo.<<ref "w">> He likes to fish. He was exhausted, openly cussed with us. 

Shopping @ A Mineral Sto. Spicyazngilf. Touched all the things. Pretty, nice smelling. Woo, lad. Very fancy rocks. Apparently, good prices on that crystal. As long as we stick to what is aesthetic about the matter (the written descriptions of these rocks made me want to vomit, ofc*), I dig it.

Shopping @ Aldi. We went medium-sized, and I'm glad we did. Cashier overheard us talking about the eggs again, and she recommended chickens to us. Says she rescues animals in her spare time. Maybe we could get away with it, although the cashier said she got in trouble for it.

[[TTTOTW]]. Sucking and chewing on the last fingernail of hers I've hoarded.

Shopping @ W-Entity with my sympaticon. Noods and dairy.

[[TTTOTW]]. The afternoon four had flan together. That shit is fancy. Offspring made some progress. `/nod`. My son decided to play. Caught him up to his sister. Maam should eventually be well-stocked. I'd like to have one open sorc who isn't stuck on a solo map. They don't want to rush, understandably. I'll wait. I've got Bowchika to level with my sympaticon too, and that will be significantly more challenging given how weak my zon will be. Eventually, going kicker, with practice, will trivialize it for us. I can suck and it won't matter (apparently, chain casting decoy is a real strat, yo).

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. She takes what happens to her library users so personally. Vocation. //Inform the Men!// Meditation, and maybe even fell partially asleep. Felt woozy.

[[TTTOTW]]. [[D2]] + //Hyperion// @063:01:07 with my sympaticon. Set a timer. Swapping gear out. Need to get max resists on that sorc, and the assassin has enough to make it safely to 70ish. The moment we can safely kick, we should. I can reach and clear to initiate the throne room while she hits [[Nihlathak|D2: Nihlathak's Assassin]]. I'm hoping that all 4 of us can do the Ubers. 

Made dinner with my sympaticon. I was semi-useful, despite there not being any prep to do. 

[[Family Gathering]]. We had chicken tendie parm and water. Watched S03E01 of //Stranger Things//. It crumbles, but I like the swimsuit scenes of course. My son stayed longer than usual, but he thought we were going to continue to watch. Attempted to translate the message once again, but it failed. `/shrug`. nm. 

Quietly chilled with mi amor. 

Bringing up dishes that never made it up. Put my sympaticon to bed. [[TTTOTW]]. Put mi amor to bed. Book chapter proposal to write. S is going to be asked to do some important tasks, rational ones that will make her life easier too, that she won't like. =/. SZ watches like a hawk; that woman has a deep understanding of her work. It's so weird to see the levels at and right above mi amor stacked with veterans who have worked there for 30-40 years, all geriatrics.

[[TTTOTW]]. Woke my sympaticon from a nightmare, maybe. 

```bash
yay -S friendiqa --noconfirm
# meh
```

Watered the [[garden]] at 11pm in muh underwear again. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Been checkin' for [[down2earth]], but haven't seen them.
