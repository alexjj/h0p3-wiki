title: 2020.12.08 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Finna Get Outta Da Hoel

* Woke at 4
* Read+Write+//GoT//
* Fireman Time!
* Chilled with my wife. Glad to see she's taking the morning off.
* Slick Xfinity Wageslave With Nifty Accent Shows Up Late
** "There's your problem." He didn't want to mess with wiring inside, so he ran it outside. Cool.
** I'm glad to have interwebs. Unfortunately, it's 100 down, 6 up. That upload speed is quite a bottleneck. I've become so spoiled with gigabit before. I can live on that still. 
** Wife and I played some [[MTG]] to pass the time while answering questions here and there. I lost three in a row to Ajani Pridemate. Demolished. 
* Costco
** Son pumped gas, I filled the tires.
*** Noticed that our front tires aren't in good shape. They need to be replaced. 
**** Not sure if it's worth it. Could die any day. Probably should though. Run it into the ground as I usually do.
** The one closest to us is fucking huge. I've never seen one that big before. They didn't have the shelf we were after, but the lady at the front looked up all the Costcos in the area. She found another.
** Son and I wandered the store a bit just to get a feel. Then we got hotdogs and soda water!<<ref "l">> =)
** Lots of phone tag because I screwed up: I was supposed to set up the router before I left (or not take as long as I did). I did what I usually do when testing a modem: I plug it straight into a machine, and it worked, cool. Had my daughter take the router from downstairs and set it up, but it wouldn't work. Eventually, told them to wire straight in (could use [[m12]]), but it was too late. The meeting had started before they got it up. It's my fault she missed that meeting. =/. Fuck. 
*** She doesn't think it's a big deal. It might not be. Still, it shouldn't have happened. 
** Second Costco had the shelf, and we grabbed some noodles.
* Landlord is not being honest. =/. We have pictures from the day we moved in. That house is clean, and much cleaner now than when we got it. Not much in our power to do here. It's not like I'm going to go to court over this small shit. Aint nobody got time for that. It's injustice, but fuck it. 
** She did eventually contact one of her wageslaves about the floor and agreed that we weren't responsible for that.
** She claimed we took her curtains (we left her the curtains she had, and we had purchased more). Despite our pictures, she remembers otherwise (she remembers our curtains, not hers). Fine, you can have our curtains too. 
** She was unhappy that we had hung pictures, chalkboard, and whiteboard on the wall. She is going to repaint the entire house because of it, and we are paying for it. I know she has the extra matching paint, but that's not what she's going to do. I'll agree that house could use a better painting even before we moved in (it was poorly done). I fixed her walls up for her (including the holes the previous tenants had left).
** Eh. I'm glad we won't have a landlord outside the new mortgage company who has bought our first mortgage packaged by the first (still smells like 2008 there, btw). We'll see what happens. I believe we will get the prorated amount and some of the deposit, but she may prove more resourceful in nickle and diming us (it's part of how she makes her money as a rent-seeker).
* Someone offered to bang me again. =). She looks exhausted. Just read grill.
* Unpacking, living room and kitchen are navigable at this point.
* [[JRE]] called
** Asked if donors' present arrived.
*** I gave the answer. My brother knew I wasn't happy (and knew I wouldn't be happy). I do not see a rational reason to have this conversation given multiple alternatives (not his job to do first off). He apologized. He doesn't mean harm by it, obviously.
**** I [[aim]] to be an ear for him when he wants to think about his own thoughts and concerns regarding them (though I find it painful, it is my duty). This was a triangle, and I think he should have known better.
** Quinn is puking a lot. Way too much (though impressive projectile distance for his age). 
*** Nobody likes puke, but it gets to my brother more than most. It's extra frustrating when everything seems to get covered in it.
**** Matthew's formula switch did the trick, and I'm hoping something similar will happen for Quinn.
** Matthew is gettin' jealous.  
** Bro's back hurts too much to wear a sling/pack. He can hold both well enough though.
*** No good rocking options either. 
** He's so fucking tired. It's probably the most tired I've heard him in a while. =/.
*** Gonna stick with the meds for several weeks to see. Makes sense. 
*** I wish there was a way to get some sleep over to him (and Rebecca, I bet). They need a break. 
** Rebecca still hates her job.
*** She sounded chipper enough with her family though. 
** Cumtown, //GoT//
** I got to hear Matthew try to babble stories (you can hear the joy in the boy's voice), and he was able to follow directions cleanly. 
*** Tremendous. I only have a few images of the growing boy, but I can see him in my head picking up the book and putting it where it belongs. He's getting there. I know that fear. 
** My brother cracks jokes the entire time he's with his babies. It's a shame they don't get to know his humor yet.
** Quinn's mom is back with the male biodonor, and that is not a good sign.
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Salad, Apples, Beer, Pizza Rolls
** [[MTG]]: Offspring are in full tilt. They watched the adults play. 
*** By the end, they seemed to be feeling better. I brought out MBPox against Soul Sisters, and we got see the hardlocks. 
** No kitchen for them. They just need time to chill.
* Sleep by 8:45
** Pooped. 

I've banged my head 4 times today and I missed 6 turns, lol. I am a clown, but not on a purpose in this case. Everyone felt emotionally drained today. We're almost out of the hole though.
