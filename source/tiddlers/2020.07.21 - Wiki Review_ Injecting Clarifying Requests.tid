** Completed. My wife doesn't mind as much, but she would be happy if none of us had bodies and we were just floating spirits or something. 
*** Though, I will coat her with fuzz/hair, and then she must shower me off her, lol.

** It was my fault that dinner wasn't made in time. =/. 
** I'm hunting for answers, unlikely to find one. I don't know what else to do in my shoes. The world needs crazies like me who would dare waste their lives like that, lol.
