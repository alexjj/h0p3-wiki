title: 2020.11.01 - Family Log: MHHHHHH CHAIRS

!! Write a paragraph summarizing each person's week:

* [[DeathOfRobinhood]]
** We got to visit my wife's friend, and to read while eating a chocolatine. Booted up old software (recognized as a virus) KG2 second editor, enjoyed the process of creating a system in which characters spar, nostalgia 2005-2012, revisiting (it was like having a lava lamp). Lots of phone calls, and people around him have been changing a lot; feels like people have more volatile lives than he has. 
* [[AIR]]
** Did a lot of work, except for yesterday. Wasn't feeling good. Set the appointment though. Went on a beautiful walk. Frost is coming, and hope it doesn't come for a while. Very nervous about the election. Anxiety. We both went shopping just to make sure we have some fruits and veggies in the house for whatever comes. Worried about civil war, and really hope just being overly cautious. Feels like there's going to be a negative outcome inevitably. A lot of my friend who hate guns have purchased one recently.

*** I've noticed a minor mental problem where my mind will randomly berate itself while in thought (about almost anything, really.), even if I'm happy! I've noticed it happening every one or two days, which isn't really good. I believe this stems from my mind berating and insulting itself after and during an unhappy lecture. I've returned to taking an hour or so to get to sleep, and have a pseudo-set schedule for waking up on Saturdays and Sundays.
** j3d1h
*** Your week wasn't too awful, I think? I missed talking about characters and such with you, but I'm sure we will soon. I also hope you're (eventually) comfortable enough to join in an RP with Smokey/Sparks/me! I'm hoping you feel much less pressure next week than you have for a while. School will, hopefully, be fun for you - have you figured out anything good for engineering?
** k0sh3k
***  I'm looking forward to your success in this week's experiment; I hope you take it and run. I really liked watching Halloween movies with you. I hope you'll be more careful about dressing warmly when you go outside; don't forget your gloves! And I hope you'll look hard for your phone before you have to get a new one - maybe the couch? 
** h0p3
*** [[1uxb0x]] was fairly quiet this week. He met some professors and said something to Howard that made other professors laugh. He continues to hone a voice and a point of view in his argumentation. He didn't do his school work this week, but he did his public chores. He lost his phone and didn't do anything about it; it will be his job to purchase another and replace the sim card. Walks with his father were intense. He had a favorable view toward [[Fitness Routine]]. We've gotta make sure he's explicitly asking himself if he's dressed warmly enough (me too). The repairman agreed with my son's assessment of the heater. He ate good food, watched some good flix, and played plenty.

* [[j3d1h]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I say this every time, but I love talking to you. Its odd how I see parts of our parents relationship in ours. We have a similar walking relationship, where on Thursdays we'll walk and talk to the store. Thank you for helping me fix my computer when the password manager borked. Percussive maintenance is amazing, 
** j3d1h
*** I'm trying to get better at spinning up new characters, and for the most part, it's working. I've found a lot more confidence and motivation to draw. It could be that I'm - *gasp* - //proud of my recent work?// School will probably be easier in the next week, I just have to make sure I drop the tumblr aesthetic going on. Speaking of aesthetic, I'm very slowly bringing that TW makeover to life (who saw the sidebar change?). Also, fingerless gloves are the //best//.
** k0sh3k
*** I really hope you take the opportunity to show us this week that you can do the work with us being hands-off. I also hope to see at least one really good creative writing practice done, not just copied. I really enjoyed Halloween movie time with you. I really liked your outfit yesterday, too! One of my high school friends said he thought it was an old picture of me from high school at first, so I guess you look a lot like I did when I was your age.  Thank you for holding your father back in his conversation with Howard and Ellen.
** h0p3
*** [[j3d1h]] generously hugged her father more this week. She acquired root with a keylogger (right on). She went for a personal look this Halloween; she reminds me of another person I know well. Her schoolwork does not exist, and it's up to her; I'm not going to even speak about school this week with her (sadly, we probably won't walk either). She and her brother set up the whiteboard for a collaborative piece of art (it was fun to see measuring instruments and levels used to make clean lines and spaces). She filled a thumbdrive for Howard and Ellen. She's had way more time with her friends, and we've seen way less of her this week. I hope she will spend her (and our) resources wisely.

* [[k0sh3k]]
** 1uxb0x
***  I love doing church with you. I'm definitely going to call you grandma death if I have kids: and even if I don't. We had a bad Thursday, I don't think we'll have such a bad one next week. It's bad that your week was stressful.
** j3d1h
*** I really appreciate you writing down Reflection on Legal Heritage. The conversation was interesting to me, so learning more is pretty much always welcome. It sounds like your week was stressful, but I think you're still sort of getting better. I'm a little worried that we haven't heard back about the house yet, but I'm sure it's fine. Yes, it's honestly shocking how many people say they believe in god, and really just mean "go fuck yourself" when they do. `:/` 
** k0sh3k
*** MeeScan ate up a lot of my week, as did management class and LAC. It was a busy meeting week! I unwound with a //lot// of Elementary. I am reading less; it's one of those phases, I guess. I talked to a lot of students this week about their stress and plans for the next few months, too; I'm glad I put up the resource display for them. Of particular interest was the conversation with a student who shares my interest in the psalms as bibliotherapy.
** h0p3
*** [[k0sh3k]] is terrible human being for not make appreciate Borat (though she will discuss it, ofc). Despite not being able to go to church, I can tell she's been finding ways to build community to fill the hole. It was a joy to watch //Donnie Darko// with her (and the offspring) again; now I must lay down my tentpegs in the desert (it is so expensive to do). I can't wait to call her Grandma Death. It's a movie that defines our marriage. I did not predict her period this time (hrm). She seems to be in the stasis-holding-pattern with me too. Her touch keeps me in the world.

* [[h0p3]]
** 1uxb0x
*** Jeezums, I'm growin larger than ya! You've been sittin' in your onesie the entire week, do ya even wash it in-between? We've not had a great week, it's lately collapsed. I've noticed a pattern in school where I'll do well then start to tilt a little more to the worse side of things, and it'll just drop.
** j3d1h
*** I swear, one of these days (when I'm 18, probably), I'm going to simply stop reading your wiki for all the disgusting stuff you write. I should figure out how to build extensions so I get a filter warning when you do.<<ref "1">> If you were a book, you'd obviously be bad. In other news, your maymays are still gold, and you have some cool ASCII art for Tapeda. I'm sorry we didn't talk/hug much this week, I missed it a little too.
** k0sh3k
*** You're always skin-hungry, but I think you've been needier than usual lately. You also seem to be writing less, overall. Seasonal, perhaps? Winter, yes, but every once in a while you go all internal/introspective and find something new in yourself; maybe it's time for that again?
** h0p3
*** [[h0p3]] is a nerd ([[j3d1h]] made me do it), and he is holding his breath. He's been buried in reading, understanding too little, and he can't predict shit. Why not just sleep, eat, get high, and masturbate at-will? What's the worst that could happen? LoL championships were a reprieve. He's sad about school, but hopefully it'll be a time of radical growth. It's been a solid week of limbo.

** Cardiologist tomorrow. Something isn't right. Getting a covid test too. A few flutters, and it shouldn't be doing that at this point. It feels like it's about to go into palpitations and cold sweats. Following through on it. Digestive issues too.

* [[AIR]]
** Splurged on a griddle. Breakfast with Lilly was the highlight of the week. Lilly interactions have been positive and uplifting. Lots of hope! 
** The flutter is the primary worry. It's scary. I have health insurance, so I can get some things done, maybe.

* [[DeathOfRobinhood]]
** In another call I made with another person, I was encouraging. I hoped to be a conduit of the grace of God. I didn't go into the conversation feeling very well-equipped, but I was happy that I was able to say something useful to them.
* [[AIR]]
** ~~Jesus is hard for me. Amen.~~ I am considerate of other people's wants or needs. I actively seek it. Lilly has only been eating box macaroni for a long time now. Making a meal for her made for a calm and good experience.
