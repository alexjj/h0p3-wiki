title: 2020.11.30 - Wiki Review: Less Verbose

* [[2020.11.29 - Family Log: Thoinks Yoinking]]
** He is my favorite boy in the world.
* [[2020.11.29 - Prompted Introspection: Recurring Dreams]]
** Completed. Necro and bard were the most bitchin' of classes in EQ. Duos, however, at extremely high end gear, seems hard to beat War/Cleric, but SK/Shaman might pull off some insane things too. Longing to play games I ought not, of course.
* [[2020.11.29 - Wiki Review: Schizo Retardations]]
** Completed. Might not be much faster than we intended anyway. It's okay if it takes us two weeks. It shouldn't. I need to bang out [[Monthly Auditable]]s (grafting happens when it does)<<ref "a">> before I hit that stack.
* [[2020.11.29 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: End of Vacation]]
** I've noticed [[CTS]] has become less verbose. I'm hunting for a middle ground, I guess. May it grow in iterations.
** Not completely glad, of course. But, the break is more important.
