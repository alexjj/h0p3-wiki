Hello
Mar 1 6:49pm
How the hell have y’all been!? 😂 just thought I say hi to the best neighbors in the world 🙏🏽
Mar 1 6:53pm
Hey!
Mar 1 6:57pm
I miss yall. We moved into the house. I think you'd enjoy coming over, way more space and goodies.
Mar 1 6:58pm
We've been busy AF.
Mar 1 6:59pm
It's been almost 5 months, and I have no idea how to summarize it. lol.
Mar 1 6:59pm
How about yall? How's life going?
Mar 1 6:59pm
I've been curled up lately, reading and writing, more quietly than usual in some respects. My work was lambasted recently (dude knows how to meme): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDnd7_lSM3M

[[k0sh3k]]'s become indispensable in her workplace. It's stressful, but her job is a source of meaning too.
Mar 1 7:05pm
Offspring are struggling, as usual, to do their schoolwork. They've grown. They are almost as tall as I am.
Mar 1 7:05pm
(though, I'm a short manlet, lol)
Mar 1 7:05pm
My brother [[5c0ut]] has come to live with us, and that's been awesome. Helping him transition and rebuild here.
Mar 1 7:06pm
This part might seem awkward, but I'm a straight shooter. My wife has regularly encouraged me to seek more female companions in life (I realize that is not typical), and this year I've decided to try that. I've met another woman through my ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 (she writes her own, and we share an enormous amount). I'm at about 80 100k-word novels in length in mine, and she's read most of it and constructed her own very lengthy work (has been adding her old written journals too). It's been an overwhelming experience, in a good way.
Mar 1 7:10pm
I've been working on the house, organizing, repairing, trying to get it into shape. It's in reasonable shape, but there's still a lot to do.
Mar 1 7:11pm
Recently picked up a dab rig and subohm vape mod + tank. Delta 8 has been delightfully cheap (28g 88% distillate for $90 after coupon).
Mar 1 7:13pm
Gonna be trying Salvia here soon enough for the first time. I'm excited. Should also be able to actually smoke the DMT I made (back when we were neighbors). Not ready for the trip yet, but looking forward to it.
Mar 1 7:14pm
Like a true internet neckbeard troll, I live in the basement now, and I think I continue to become more and more like Dale Gribble off King of The Hill, lol.
Mar 1 7:15pm
Overall, despite the chaos of the world, our tiny locale has been flourishing. I'm grateful.
Mar 1 7:18pm
You have to take the bad with the good! We are not much farther than we were! Lol just kidding we’re blessed. I bought my truck finally I was fortunate enough to get the opportunity to trade the black Pilot for a 2019 Honda Pilot. Matthew went back to Colorado. I came home to him and his room empty. My house ransacked and Max gone. In return we have a new pup he’s a landshire heeler. That’s been a roller coaster. I’ve also been losing weight. My choice I just don’t want to end up with any conditions due to my health. Esteban has been a great support not at first but after dropping 20lbs in a month he has really seen the importance. He made full time with the city he’s the first Mexican in the White House 😅 over all it’s been a journey. We haven’t decided if we want to return to Colorado or not so. We continue to take it day by day.
Mar 1 7:36pm
That is a lot. Wow. I am sad to hear that it was abrupt with Matthew. You are an amazing sister. I know that must have been extremely painful.
Mar 1 7:39pm
You have been really constructive though, and I'm glad to hear that life is still coming together, into the unknown we journey.
Mar 1 7:40pm
It was but that was my mother’s plan. I wish him the best because not even 30 days after leaving we received letters in the mail about him being -$3000
Mar 1 7:40pm
I might’ve been a lot of things but Matthew never had a negative bank account with me and I always allowed him to save what he could
Mar 1 7:40pm
No I wasn’t perfect and asked him to help contribute to take care of himself he’s grown and I think that was reasonable request but apparently he went and told her that I was using him and not doing what I should do as the pretty little picture wasn’t his mind even though the night before he left I literally went and picked up pictures that I had framed at Michael's for his birthday I spent $240 on them but yet I was so unfair?
Mar 1 7:41pm
=/. I am sorry to hear that. It's not your fault. We all know how much you love that man. He's like you son and your brother. You've done right by him.
Mar 1 7:42pm
Sorry voice text I hope that all made some sense
Mar 1 7:42pm
Yes. I understand.
Mar 1 7:42pm
I did my very best.
Mar 1 7:42pm
I have to say, your mom seems like a difficult human being to be around sometimes (and I know you love her too).
Mar 1 7:42pm
Still, I'm glad to hear there are also many positives in your life.
Mar 1 7:43pm
Congratz to Esteban. I hope they are treating him right.
Mar 1 7:43pm
Yall making any friends out there?
Mar 1 7:44pm
(I've largely failed here, but covid has been a monkey wrech...probably a monkeywrench everywhere come to think ofit)
Mar 1 7:44pm
Yea I was going to say the lack of people’s knowledge in just being decent human beings has not made us wander too far from home. We’ve really just been focusing on ourselves since Matthew left and doing self development working taking care of animals 😂 it’s the life!
Mar 1 7:54pm
Sorry again using voice text*
Mar 1 7:54pm
Yes, ma'am. I know the feeling.
Mar 1 8:07pm
Also, let me know if you all could use any books, audio books, shows, movies. I know it can be a source of pleasure and more while cooped up.
Mar 1 8:08pm
Yes thank you!
