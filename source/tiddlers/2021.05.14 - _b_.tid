Why should think top-down control will always dictate how one perceives, organizes, and reacts to bottom-up stimuli in one's environment, Baye? I agree that our teleological intentionality //sometimes// opens a landscape of possibility in front of us simply in virtue of attention, though I see it as neither necessary nor sufficient. Of course, I often applaud a willingness to radically invite possibility rather than passively accept reality as is (including the anxiety of closing off possibilities). The schizo's attention is not freedom itself though it may be crucial to self-legislation. We aren't who we pretend to be, though I agree we must be careful who we pretend to be. Our beliefs and attentions are not identical, even if they shape each other.

i declare myself a fiscal marksis and a social anarksis. the more crimes you do, the more socialister it is. both socialism (like the fire department saving your house) and capitalism (like the insurance company denying your claim) fail because they are attempts to codify and imitate nature. evil is handled in a different department entirely. i need to get topped, and my epistemic status: not confident enough to bet against someone whoâ€™s likely to understand this stuff. this sounds plausible enough to not bother researching or thinking about it.

Skritch In Sand: you will receive a body in which you should learn lessons, and you will probably make mistakes repeatedly even after learning said lessons. There is a better than here, and others are not merely mirrors of you. What you make of your life is only partially up to you, and life isn't exactly what you think it is in most cases. Answers lie both inside and outside you, and learning is not the same thing as remembering. Pilot your flesh beast wisely.

xoomers, letsgooofinnanocapvibinrnfrion, yeet me ur discord (even discord isn't old enough to be on discord) and we can facetime, catch feelings, go balls deep, can't even pull out of a fucking driveway. i'm not saying it, but I am typing it: always be horny for attention from the queen of monsters and her idle speculation.

I think my job often boils down to finding the differences that matter, then maintaining or moving tentpegs alongside my interlocutor. Practicing The Golden Rule is hard, [[WINTCIS]]. Usually, I just spin my wheels, and it's therefore also my job to try to make that efficient (my version of going with the flow as a wrestler).

I want to watch Emily and Karen fuck.
