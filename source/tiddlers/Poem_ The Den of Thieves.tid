//Lawd, Laminate & Bind Us Togehvuh. Hao 2 Base(me~~a~~n't) in `/this` placeness. O' yes, yes they do, M'theydy. The Treasures of Our Hearts & Minds, As Wisely As We Know Hao. I <3 U2, Chairman Meow//<<ref "a">>

O' Family,
I Beg You. 
What Ought We Build?
Tell me.

[[FTSO]][[W5H]][[gfwiwcgws]][[irwartfrr]], 
my ninjas, my shibboleth gnostics, my Senpais, my Madames, my Sirs, & my [[Anon]]s.

In The Application of [[Virtue is Knowledge]], 
We come to know The Knowledge Of Virtue and more.
WHAT WILL BE OUR [[SHARED|Sharing]] ALTARS?
I never know well enough.
Help me.

`/Dwigt's Speech In Dalek`: We R ~~petit bourgeoisie~~ Fremen Warriors!!!
May there be bread and cold carbonated water on the table, 
a couch, a battlestation, and our laundry too.
May it be lived in, practical to the right art.
May even the cats and spiders trust and adore it.

What treasure should be everywhere, not just here?
It is this place or toward it.
