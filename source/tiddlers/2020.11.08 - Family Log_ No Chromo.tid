!! Write a paragraph summarizing each person's week:

* [[1uxb0x]]
** 1uxb0x
*** Wow, I had at least 25 words this week! That's like, 25 times as much as 1! I wrote a lot a stuff in my personal library thing, and I'm happy that I did! I had a lot of fun this week, and got to look at several games. My mother has asked that I try to refrain from anything related to games, be it writing about stats for one or something like that.
** j3d1h
*** I think your stress has gone way down this week. I did miss seeing you and talking to you a bit, but we did chat now and then, which is good. You seemed pretty "blah" the whole week too, so I hope you feel better soon! Thank you for doing most of the work on changing the car battery (or, at least, most of the physical labour).
** k0sh3k
*** I was not thrilled with your work for this week, as you can probably imagine. I hope your work this next week gets back on track. I am glad you're enjoying playing in your head and writing things down. I hope this next week, you'll search for other things that bring you joy, too. Thank you for working on the car battery, too.
** h0p3
*** [[1uxb0x]] played instead of doing school work. He did not work out his phone situation, but he did most of his chores. He worked on the SUV, walked a bit with his peeps, did some private writing, played vidya games, and watched lots of Youtubes. He may be taller than his sister now (dude keeps growing), but that's probably because she slouches. He's spent a lot of time on his own this week, but that doesn't seem bothersome for him.

* [[j3d1h]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I liked talking with you, and I wish I could talk to you more. We didn't have much interaction this week, but I enjoyed what little we did. I'm happy that we can be honest with eachother about everything. I really don't know what else to say
** j3d1h
*** This week was simultaneously boring and panicked. I don't think the election worried me much, surprisingly. I was just anxious for no clear reason. I managed to draw a few things (including a doodle of a rose). Still didn't feel motivated to do it, but `lofi hip hop radio beats to relax/study to` did help. I can try again next week at school.
** k0sh3k
*** I hope the experiment with your schooling works better this week; we'll see. I hope so. I do enjoy talking to you about music and art. I've really liked seeing your own fashion style come together. Thank you for working on the car battery, too.
** h0p3
*** [[j3d1h]] spent lots of time on Discord with her homies. She got some drawing in. She's been using my laptop instead of her own (?). Her school work does not exist, again (and the proof has been delivered, again). She led the charge on replacing the SUVs battery, soup to nuts. She and her brother made a delicious meal on Thursday. Her room is beginning to look like her mother's. She's not feeling motivated.

* [[k0sh3k]]
** 1uxb0x
*** It's easy to say you value Brains over looks, why? Because father isn't often called beautiful but he is smart. I see that both of us are effected by melatonin (or at least, you've slept well since you've been taking it.) If you lost your current job, you could probably get a new one with ease.
** j3d1h
*** You seem to have lots of anxiety about this/next year (and understandably!). I don't think any of that will happen, but unfortunately, no one thought 2020 would happen either. I liked your RCL a lot, and again, it was pretty different from what you said during church. It's fun picking out the differences (and getting 2 lessons from the same set of words). It sounds like you desperately need coffee at all times - you should probably stockpile it, lol.
** k0sh3k
*** Work this week was productive; the overhaul of the student worker hiring process is coming along nicely. Management class is chugging along. I burned out faster on Helstrom than I thought I would, but I continued to like ST:LD all the way through. The election was stressful, but it's over now and Trump is not going to be president for the next four years, so that's good. The Asylum's closing was pushed back another week; I'll be glad when that's done, too. I really enjoyed talking to Rach; I should call her more often.
** h0p3
*** [[k0sh3k]] has enjoyed her management class (may she have so many more). Speaking with Rachel was a damned good use of her time. She's been sitting in limbo about The Asylum, and that has been a source of anxiety. Star Trek has been cute and something to take her mind off things, and she's been reading again (ugh, such a waste of glorious hips [or a refusal to multi-task]). The election has been a relief for her, and her sisters are threatening to leave FB (cheers all around yall).

* [[h0p3]]
** 1uxb0x
*** The break helped to cool down my negative thoughts, so that's a good part of the test. We need to exercise more. You smell bad, maybe it's because you wear the same clothes over and over again.
** j3d1h
*** I'm sure you missed me a lot this week. Actually, I noticed it quite a lot (and I bet everyone did)! Yep, you have very much earned the title of "degenerate". You have //got to// start sleeping earlier, if you don't want to legitimately become a vampire.  It seems like you insult Samwise for asking shallow questions, but you hate it when he asks the important ones, too...
** k0sh3k
*** It's obvious you missed walking and talking with the kids this week, even though you did have lots of conversations with others. I hope you all find a balance where you can walk and talk without pissing each other off. (Good luck.) You did a more thorough job than usual in describing your days, too. I am never going to let you decorate for the holidays.
** h0p3
*** [[h0p3]] had a lowkey week. He had few responsibilities. He did his best not to speak to his offspring about that-topic-which-should-not-be-named. He missed seeing his offspring a lot, like, almost drug-withdrawals bad: he did a good job not losing his mind though. He got to talk with plenty of folks, and that was great. He didn't walk as much as he should have. He poisoned his mind and defiled his body, so he's got that going for him. It was a good week for him.

* [[AIR]]
** It was an intense emotional rollercoaster of a week, but it became more positive over the course of the week. Covid test came back negative so I get to go back to work. Asked to be a chef for a possible new restaurant. Lots of weed and trying not to be anxious about the election.

!! How has your health been this week?

* 1uxb0x
** Weird vision.
* j3d1h
** Slept a lot more. Might just be boredom. Took my iron, and still got that dizziness thing.
* k0sh3k
** Tired, some backaches.
* h0p3
** Solid. Probably didn't sleep enough.
* [[AIR]]
** Worried about my heart flutter, and I'm going to see a doctor soon about it. Feeling less anxious too.
** Losing hair?

---
!! What happened last week? How and why did it happen? Name at least one happy and one unhappy thing.

* 1uxb0x
** Fewer negative thoughts.
** Going through a growth spurt.
* j3d1h
** Drawed like the drawer I am.
** Felt blargh the entire week.
* k0sh3k
** The closing date got pushed back another.
** Got to talk Rach.
* h0p3
** Marginally less fascist person who's going to be POTUS.
** Capitalists are still in power.
* [[AIR]]
** Using my griddle has been a great joy. I have no idea why I've never had one before. 
** I think I'm allergic to eucalyptus. I was given this conditioner with it that tore my scalp apart. Then I realized the stuff I use for my beard has been doing the same thing, and they both have eucalyptus.

---
!! Outside of our immediate family, who did we have significant social interactions with? 

* A Swedish banana
* FTO pings
* Root Users
* Smokey & Sparks
* Butter
** Gratz to Q&A and Z!
* Trailmates
* Rach
* Gage, being able to express my anxiety, and I appreciate that he doesn't think I'm crazy. He's a good man, and I appreciate him.

---
!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family (including ourselves)?

* 1uxb0x
** I'm happy that I come back to old games like MTG.
** Thank you for working on the car battery.
** You've been doing a better job of dealing with your negative thoughts. 
** I like that you struggled with the tooling on the battery and didn't give up.
** I like that you're aware of your boundaries when getting involved in serious problems.
* j3d1h
** I'm glad I still experiment to see what makes me actually happy. It's useful.
** Thank you for working on the car battery.
** I'm glad to be one of the recipients of your cooking experiments.
** I like how you've been reasoning about the sociopath in one of your friend groups.
** Thank you for researching and explaining the steps for the car battery.
* k0sh3k
** I have used my empathy to help several student workers with their anxiety this week.
** I appreciate how you have handled your management class such that it doesn't make your days even worse.
** I like that you don't mind small questions and such. That really ticks me off about most people.
** Thank you for allowing us to do this experiment with school.
* h0p3
** I appreciate that I don't mind making a fool of myself.
** This past week was harder on you than anyone else in the household.
** You are very affectionate (especially given male stereotypes).
** Thank you for helping to replace the battery.
* [[AIR]]
** I've been thinking about this all fucking week, and I've got one: my laugh. You can hear me from a distance and it's infectious, and I like when people laugh at my life. It lightens everything up.
