[[TTTOTW]]. Stumbled upon a treasure trove of [[vidya]]. I'm a simple man. Also, it's muhfuckin' FO'TWENTY!

Fireman Time! Washing up, laundry, some prep for dinner, hung the first picture on our wall in [[The Alien Asylum]] (the piece of cardboard that belongs to me and my wife, lol), then had pasta and an italian ice (thank you for lending me one :P), part of a LolVoD, [[TTTOTW]].

Tons of fog out. It was cool. Wife was chipper (though dead by the end of the day), but her neck wasn't right. Mini-massage while she read. I'm starving.

Sleep was long but not good. Hrm. Meditation. Fireman Time! Cleaning, Laundry, [[TTTOTW]]. 
Hugs'n'bugs with folks, Showered (the stank has faded for now), and //Skintime//. Autist need heavy on top now plz, so she skished me.When you open both the windows, the curtains are like sails in the wind. Had her test my pillow instead, that scoliosis is such a bitch. Watched a [[vidya]] from some boogie scum who also said some important facts. Deja vu. Board has my notes. Hopefully, we'll get back to it. I cannot handle that much bullshit in one setting anymore. It's like a pure simulation. 

[[TTTOTW]].

Thinking about quotes and studying with my offspring. Disappointed. Massive dialectures. Dad did da do. 

//The Walk// was awesome. 420 Blazeit, err Δ⁸ Vapelyfe. Dreading it being it over on our last stretch. She's not feeling well at all. This is pure generosity. Kevin announced the end of his reign. `/fistpump`. Seems she reads everyone under the table, and they are coming to realize that too. {[[Dream]]}ing, library construction, and with open systems. Her professors asking for her advice and opinions again. Oh, we needed our camera: there's this tree species we've seen in the area that has basically pure flowers of some super bright color (I hesitate to name any color 'cause I can't see colors well enough), and I normally wouldn't want something just because it's pretty, but maybe we could plant one. It's really, really pretty. 

Made dinner with offspring. More dialectures, and the sad kind, sadly. In one ear, out the other, maybe, maybe not.

Sittin' on the couch, holding hands. Bro came home. Bursting with stories and even had a video for us. The nursing home sounds better, though consulting (second time this word has come up today) for this restaurant might be worthy.

[[Family Gathering]] was solid. Zucchini and squash, a thick potato soup with baked potatoes (and, I want to make that again; was like biscuits and gravy, but in terms of potato), and very thin porkchops (probably meant to be cut up entirely). My bro recounted work. My son and I finished our match. We were both giddy for the game, having been thinking about the position we left it in. He curb-stomped me in three turns (chandra ult + capsize = scoop). The other two games were less fun, unremarkable. Sylvan libraries for him, Gisela T4 and other beats for me. Unrecoverable as I ride her with permission and spot removal, and he simply can't drop enough to race in either game.

Said my goodnights. Chilled with broski, watched a LolVod. It's fun watching with him. I've never had someone to watch the game with who has played. Eventually, I got figuratively got off my ass and got to work. [[TTTOTW]]
