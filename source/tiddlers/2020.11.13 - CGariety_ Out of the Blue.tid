Dearest Philosopher,

It is my honor and pleasure to meet you, nomad. I'm just a madman out here in the desert, and your work is a quiet oasis I've been lucky enough to stumble across a few times here in the past month (this is the second time I've felt compelled to reach out to you). Being a public wrestler, you must hear these words all the time: I love your work. Thank you! I am particularly struck by this one, sir:

I would like to know anything more you can say of it, even whispers, scribblings, links, anything! I hope your future work will continue to flesh that out for the rest of us. I hold it in such high regard, even though I can scarcely say anything about it well enough myself.

We appear to share many things in common beyond our respect for persons and appreciating philosophy. I'm an autistic person with Geschwind Syndrome. I like to read and write a lot (even publically, though not as cleanly as you). I feel a surprisingly sense of kinship with you. 

Sincerely,
