title: 2020.10.03 - Prompted Introspection: Kids These Days

!! What do you think is the most important thing for today's kids to learn in school?

...that I can't give a satisfactorily reductive answer to this question without having lost something [[salient]] for their broader set of contexts. What I'm doing in this wiki is something I'd want to speak about with every student I've ever had. I have what is generally considered obscenely high expectations of human beings and their beginnings and ends, including kids. I can't pick out a school where I feel like we've done the kids [[justice]] (though, I take the world to be a school too), and they need to know that too. The question enables me to change the world or even hold everyone accountable for doing the right thing together, so the answer may be unintuitive at first glance. Of course, they need to know they've already been exploited by the generations before them, and that exploitation is likely going to continue. The odds are radically against them. They need to know the awful truth of what we are and experience the [[awe]] of what we could be. [[ridtyawtr]], and [[gfwiwcgws]], and so forth. 

I have an enormous amount of skin in the game on this one. It is easy to hold me accountable in many respects. I don't consider myself successful, but I'm going to keep trying.
