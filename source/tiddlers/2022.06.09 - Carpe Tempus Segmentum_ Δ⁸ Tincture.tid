title: 2022.06.09 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Δ⁸ Tincture

Woke at 5:30. Not a nightmare, but an overwhelming dream. Meditation/Ruminate. Raining hard. My sympaticon wasn't feeling well and came to chill with me and bandage her feet. Skishes with mi amor before she had to run off, feeling late today (but, also admits it doesn't matter if she's late...doesn't want to drive in the rain, shit weather). Yogurt and chill with my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]].

Back to sleep unknown time. Woke at noonish? Fireman time! [[TTTOTW]].

Offspring came down to grind. They are hammering out a Xonsh approach to the [[Links: Library]]. All of these toolsets that we are going to abandon for something simple: seems fine with me. Good to see them programming together. I like how they coordinate. Finished my thinking for [[The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum]]. Many [[nomad]]s this week. 

Δ⁸ Tincture created with my sympaticon. Accidentally ended up being 5mg per drop like the CBD. Bottled and labeled. ⁸Δ⁸. In time, I'll learn how to work with the material. 

Went to visit a capitalist with a lot of warning signs on his properties CLing fridges from busted up apartments that he contracts for. He does mostly painting, walls, steel stud work, etc. Offered me a job. Told me he's got too much work, but no one want to work for him. I misinterpreted him, and I asked him if everyone is looking to hire him through his contracting company, why wouldn't he ask for more money? I don't suppose he wants to pay his workers more. I did, however, offer him another deal. I would do the work //iff// my offspring could join me. But, of course, he can't afford that kind of insurance. Should have a fridge tomorrow, possibly.

Constructed my brother's box, using extra felt to make sure the glass doesn't smash. Looks fabulous on the outside, and on the inside, it's not shabby either. 

//The Walk// with mi amor. Dranks, sweaty hands, and lots of thinkin.

Helped make dinner with my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]].

[[Family Gathering]]. We had chicken parm. I paced the entire time, high AF. 

Exquisite dialectics and planning with my sympaticon. Ate my dinner near midnight.
