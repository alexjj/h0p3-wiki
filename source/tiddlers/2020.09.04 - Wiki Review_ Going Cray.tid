title: 2020.09.04 - Wiki Review: Going Cray

* [[2020.09.03 - Wiki Review: Floating]]
** I wish I could be more light-hearted for them. It's not my role.
*** I am lucky to read my [[Root Users]]. All 3 are very different here. I can see they are all under a lot of pressure. =/. I hope they will feel comfortable ignoring me at-will (I am the wrong person to engage too often).

** Hey, pst, dude: maybe that's why you can't sleep to save your fucking life! 5k IUs of that D hormone does not solve the lack of exercise, and you know it. Your sedentation looks like a spiral to me. Now, are you going to be rational? I bet you won't. 
* [[2020.09.03 - Prompted Introspection: Gettin' In Trouble]]
** God damn, it's so stupid hard to [[Be A Good Dad]]. Impossible. 
* [[2020.09.03 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Lethargy]]
** Okay, because I'm retarded, I missed the signal (ofc): it was about //Dune//? Of course, I'm paranoid and feinted. Only a handful of people would even know to make that move, right? <3.
*** Truly just a crazy person speaking with himself. Go on, sir. Get it out.
* [[2020.08.13 - JRE: Music Dump]]
** I think we listen to music for different primary reasons.
* [[2020.08.17 - JRE: Kodi]]
** I would have loved to see him have to explain that. So awkward, lol. The difference between what we can say to each other and what we are allowed to say in most public contexts is vast. We are degenerates.
* [[2020.07.17 - AA: Proof Option]]
** The book was acceptable. Will be having my offspring read it too.
* [[2020.07.23 - AA: Misrepresentation]]
** I am glad that her farmhouse is congealing some. Maybe one or two more years and it will function as she'd like.
** Interesting imposition. Sometimes that's how you should spend your social capital though. I appreciate that. 
** I admire her desire to accurately represent. It's a good start.
* [[2020.07.31 - AA: Hamilton]]
** Yeah, I keep seeing deadlines being pushed. 
** Feels like the world (as I very poorly understand it) lives rent-free in my mind. It is a morally obligated requirement.
* [[2020.08.07 - AA: Images of Sun & Sunglasses]]
** I'm trying to build a bridge for her. Looks like that is not something she's interested in. 
* [[2020.08.14 - AA: Need Shovel]]
** One of my favorite parts of having a wiki in which I write so consistently is that I am allowed to say little in many cases.
** This conversation stuck with me. It's not like I've not run into these arguments quite a bit. It's a place where [[Socialism]] solves both problems. [[ridtyawtr]].
* [[2020.08.23 - AA: In Memory of KP]]
** I am sure that Mrs. Karen and I would not see eye to eye, and given her son and other positions, I am likely too charitable here (nostalgia rewrites too), but: I only have positive memories (impressions of memories*) of her. She was also kinda hiki too.
** A lot of depressed people in my life know how to light up their lives with cooking. Like reading books, this is another place that I'm not soaking up utility.
** She is much saner than many Republicans I know. I can imagine that it is extremely uncomfortable for her to speak with me here.
* [[2020.08.28 - AA: The Ledge]]
** I am lucky to have the perspective she provides. 
** I feel so many people on that ledge. My predictions suck. I don't want to think about it.
*** Fuck you and your stupid opinions, [[h0p3]]! =D.
** A lot shows up for me in few words. This is one of those places where having known someone offline brings a lot of color to the words. I can see an approximation of her face and hear a simulated voice. It's not a deficit I can overcome well enough with a wiki alone.
