MIC should be spent on Military-Grade P2Pization of Capital. I do believe that the world can build it, but we cannot assume the FLOSSers exclusively hold that responsibility (though they must guide us, and it's our fault that we don't listen). Unfortunately, the MIC is owned and operated by a self-protecting collection of capitalists and reactionaries (it's hard to pick out who isn't a reactionary at this point). It's difficult to know the degree to which the US-MIC is a 4th branch of the government (and given [[memetic warfare]], there seem to be several competing privatized armies), to some [[dok]]s, beholden only in name to a constitution (or other criterion of positive legal [[power]]).

[[Privacy]] norms are learned preferences, and subjective self-reported concerns don't seriously correlate with a person's actual privacy practices. As users gain enough experience to understand the practical political implications of acculumating personal data across various devices in The Stack, only then do they begin to care at all (when they know they aren't helpless and it's convenient because they don't have to learn more to pick that fruit). Without computer, economic, and political literacy, they can't even understand the positive structures before them, and only in studying [[Humanity]] and its [[End]]s can they pick out why they should care. Part of the postmodern problematic is that seeking [[salience]] in the flood of information can only be navigated by willing and humble students, and this topic wrestles with enough hyperobjects that even a lifetime's study isn't sufficient for what we may need (a bleak thought). Especially insofar as capitalism evolves technical mirrors of the desires of various sets of our Daseinic species (which isn't to say other animals don't have desires that affect this problem, but it's minimal), we must widely and deeply teach computational theories of mind without devolving into moral anti-realists, egoists, and reactionaries; it's the only viable chance we have. If we do not equalize the distribution of this knowledge, we will not be fair.

That we may live in a physical universe at least almost entirely based on non-local probabilistic events that we canâ€™t ever rewind does not imply we aren't incompabilitistically free (i.e. that we lack the ability to do otherwise). That doesn't defeat many types of dualism, and you can't; that would be a facile and woefully esoteric claim given your discipline, right?

PKMG [[Anon]]: store everything or at least reasonably safe pointers to them, ya gotta have stuff in your room before you can make it messy (and ya gotta have money to make money), find what is [[salient]] by hand, eventually wield ML to empower the few processes that might improve your odds of continuing to find what is increasingly salient in your context, including possibilities available to you (I have no idea what those powertools will look like well enough).

I'm tired of watching them play chicken with the treasury again.
