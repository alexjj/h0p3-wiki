title: 2022.07.28 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: There's No Wrong Way To Use A Cucumber, Larry

//The Walk// with my sympaticon. Thinking about free firewood. Planning shopping and meals. Didn't make the loop. We did, however, pass the house of the man that nearly ran us over. He smiled when mi amor fell over as I pulled us backwards. I pissed on his vehicle. Ranga met us coming and going.

//Skintime// with my sympaticon. //Yojimbo// + [[TTTOTW]]. Leftovers, yogurt, and water. Sleep by 2:30?

Woke at 6:30. Gump. Rumination. Saw mi amor off to work. [[TTTOTW]]. Yogurt. Iced my knee. Sleep on that bed has not been good for my knee. I am fat.

No surprise bad news on HTR: even after training, I may be lucky to hit 90% accuracy. It's still an active area of research, and we can't afford to pay for any such service. On single lines I hand segmented, the non-fine-tuned state of the art transformer model was at 50% with her handwriting (which ranges from serviceable cursive to my own problem: we can't read our own fucking handwriting). Yucky. If the experts are still having trouble (and I realize it wasn't fine-tuned), I'm sure I'm going to fail given the amount of effort I think is worth pouring into it. Kraken appears to be the most open-in-practice of the options. I can say this: this tooling is something her library needs for its digitization efforts, but this should not be her circus at all.

Brix. Oh, well, shit, this is harder than I thought, since I forgot: mi amor is mixing two languages together (one of which is ancient). I can't find anyone who has done this in their ground truth source. She is unimpressed with the accuracy predictions. It's a dead end. Fuck. Admittedly, hand-transcribing notes serves multiple purposes, the most important of which is achieving the ideal of digesting, filtering or distilling, and [[reconstructing]] the models as one transcribes. Zettel, recompression, drafting, and finally have the digitally searchable and pliable object.

One other hiccup on the second horn of this project, and it might make it unworthy: I can't automatically excise PPI, and I'm not convinced we should automate speech-to-text transcription into her public document. Push comes to shove, I don't think a person there shouldn't be responsible for their words: that place is as privileged as it gets. I don't think they have the right to [[privacy]] in those classrooms (so I don't have a problem with it), however, it's not my line to toe.

[[TTTOTW]]. 

SZ slipped. Our second pick is it!

[[DeathOfRobinhood]] speaks. Plans to visit in the Spring. I'm [[grateful]], as I am still waiting on being able to travel. [[5c0ut]] came down. High odds of picking up the university executive chef position, except the background check (because we live in an evil country). They pay 90% of tuition costs. [[sabaLynx]] emerges as well. 

[[TTTOTW]].

Shopping @ W-Entity with my sympaticon. Website lied to us. Grabbed some foodstuffs. Hit the liquor store to see if they had the Topo Chico. Nope. `/shrug`. 

Offspring came down to grind. [[TTTOTW]]. Eventually, could not stay awake. Sleep.

Woke at 5:45! 

//Skintime// with mi amor. Talked about work, meds, homomorphic encryption keylogger and ML steganography. Fireman Time!

Finished dinner off.

[[Family Gathering]] was delicious. Brats on rye, potato salad, Reggie's Veggies (tomatoes), water. //Stranger Things//. Apparently, Netflix/Duffer/whatever have been stealth editing this show to deal with all of the incoherencies of the story. `/nod`. The story is not rewatchable for many reasons.

Put mi amor to bed. [[R]] doesn't seem to understand her eldest daughter (and that is the charitable interpretation). Thinking about [[D2]] with my offspring, but they passed. `/nod`.

//Skintime// + //Arrested Development// with my sympaticon. [[D2]] + //Hyperion// @083:06:00. Gonna work on having a slightly longer window for Nihlathak, and gonna practice with Pindle first. We had a Vex drop for us. =D. Bandaged up my knee. It seems to be helping already.
