[5:43:31][pjnsn] could u add me please .... i added you 
[6:19:59][h0p3] Added. I was intrigued by what you chose to download before you even said anything. 
[6:21:47][h0p3] It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm content speaking asynchronously too. 
[6:25:28][pjnsn] you have very intresting and in depth stuff i like ...alot 
[6:27:13][h0p3] This is me, btw: https://philosopher.life, in case it may be useful.
[6:28:13][pjnsn] i  noticed alot of adult swim ...but no squidbillies ?   you should check it out very good shit funny cant even touch it
[6:29:05][h0p3] Squidbillies is there. It is a unique show, no doubt.
[6:30:00][pjnsn] always make me smile every time
[6:35:48][pjnsn] nice to meet you as welll  ... i like your style for sure...  what part of thecountry are you in?   im in kansas city MO   
[6:36:23][h0p3] I live in CT, primarily in my basement. Hehe.
[6:36:47][h0p3] I've thought about traveling to Kansas City many times. It is quite a drive. 
[6:36:59][h0p3] You a KC native, or how did you find yourself there?
[6:38:30][pjnsn] moved here in 98 from lincoln Nebraska    i love it here in kc ...
[6:39:06][h0p3] What do you do to survive in the world?
[6:41:47][pjnsn] i actually just got a job at ford .... but havent had a real job since 03 ....back surgery spinal stenosis atage 21    suxx   but i get by gambling ... i usually kill it at black jack 
[6:43:01][h0p3] Not many can make a living at blackjack, I assume. Presumably, it's something you've studied quite a bit. 
[6:43:29][h0p3] My friend [[Killcoin]] has had back surgery since he was fairly young. I would say it has almost ruined his life. 
[6:44:04][h0p3] I worked at a Ford factory once. I basically piled parts together. 
[6:44:14][h0p3] Paid the bills.
[6:45:02][pjnsn] yeah .i went to school to be a welder but thats rough welding 8 10 hrs a day ... .i like making yard art
[6:46:02][h0p3] Dope. I went to school for pipefittin', but the welding class let me join often enough. I wish I were more skilled at it. It's quite an artform. 
[6:46:50][h0p3] So what do you enjoy doing with your freetime then?
[6:46:59][pjnsn] ive never filled unemployment or diasbility ... prob could but fuck hand outs from the gov..... love my country ...fear my goverment
[6:48:01][h0p3] I can appreciate some fitting paranoia of those in [[power]]. 
[6:48:02][pjnsn] i enjoy good music on a killer stereo system
[6:48:02][h0p3] `/nod`.
[6:48:12][h0p3] Noice. I see you have quite a [[music]] collection.
[6:48:36][h0p3] One day, I may get me some speakers. Kinda hoping I'll find them while dumpster diving. 
[6:48:44][pjnsn] ... thats just digital ... ive got upwards of 300 vinyl 
[6:48:49][pjnsn] 3000
[6:48:53][pjnsn] records
[6:50:25][h0p3] That is a ton.
