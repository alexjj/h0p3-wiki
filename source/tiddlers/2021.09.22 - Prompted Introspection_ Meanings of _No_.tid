title: 2021.09.22 - Prompted Introspection: Meanings of "No"

!! Does "no" always really mean "no"?

No. Or maybe, yes.<<ref "d">> It depends on the context (surprise!). Is the question, does a word mean what a word means in the same time and respect? Well, no shit, Sherlock! That doesn't flesh out the problem at hand though. Do you mean to ask: are there cases in which someone says the word 'no' in a way designed to communicate something other than standard interpretations of this word or to mask (or promote) some other set of meanings? People lie, so obviously, yes. Words must be used ironically sometimes. Further, there are many connotations and tones for such a ubiquitous word,<<ref "t">> and there are contexts in which uttering the word should be interpreted in non-standard ways. Even the force with which one is saying, "no," comes in [[dok]]. 

Often, this question is concerned with consent in sexual encounters. If you've not negotiated what the word "no" means in those contexts, then you have a prima facie duty to assume it carries the standard denotation. It is better to be hedged-conservative in our interpretations.<<ref "c">>

<<footnotes "d" "Reminded of the classic joke of how double positives can never be a negative. Yeah, right.">>

<<footnotes "t" "It is among the first words learned by most children. Though, it is interesting to see how some 'natural' languages lack an explicit word for 'no', yet find other ways to communicate that (and, we are left having to talk about what is functionally a 'word'). There are many synonyms and functional negations in a wide variety of languages (and, you know how broadly I think this concept may go, Samwise).">>

<<footnotes "c" "Consent requires having fleshed out higher-ordered conceptions of The Moral Law, including having dealt with the problem of particularism. Some people have a moral claim right on my mind and body to X regarding Y. I might have a mere political right not to consent, but that doesn't mean I have a moral one not to (The Moral law overrides everything in the execution of ideal decision procedures by definition). Someone who violates that political non-consent has not necessarily done anything morally wrong. In an era in which we are clashing over the history of patriarchy, celebrating hyperindividualism, and wielding postmodernism to deny our objective obligations to others: I don't find many people who have what it takes to even begin talking about the problem with me. I usually have to approach this problem from different angles, depending on my audience's kneejerk reactions they're unwilling to [[question|Question Everything]] (especially since it's often the case that I will call their entire worldview into question), as almost no one is sufficiently rational about the matter, [[WINTCIS]].">>
