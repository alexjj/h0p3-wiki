!! How has your health been this week?

* 1uxb0x
** I had a headache this week, I think, I don't remember.
* j3d1h
** pretty much normal.
* k0sh3k
** Nightmares, but otherwise ok. 
* h0p3
** More nightmares, less sleep. Drop in libido. Rumination. More doomscrolly than usual (which is already quite high). I'm doing better about not eating too much, and I need to do more (or less*, whichever, you know what I mean). 
* ASK
** I did some puking, but technically I did that to myself. I crashed and was properly medicated. The puking was a side effect. I feel so much better now. I even Danced with a capital D. I think I've been having nightmares too, as h0p3 keeps waking me from them, but I am back to not remembering my dreams, so I can't really say. This makes me sad because I am a sporadic lucid dreamer and that circumstantial omnipotence was very useful. I was planning to try to manifest a conference room for the cast in my head, now that they have been named and defined.

!! What was interesting to you last week?

* Both conference proposals were accepted. Time to start on those!
* Consistent synchronous communication with [[Variety Creepy]]
* [[k0sh3k]] won the snow bet.
* DCK
* The world around us has felt busier, like it's moving even faster. Blurs and stress.
* Saw more of [[5c0ut]] than usual.
* A [[Resilio Sync]] upstream dependency failure.
* Our tomatoes are sprouting! I didnt expect that until next week! they're so cute! It is almost time to ~~torture~~ encourage them into their best selves.
* It was interesting to think about my letter to dad.

---
!! Outside of our immediate family, who did we have significant social interactions with? 

* [[Variety Creepy]], [[Jaxx]], [[Root Users]], Artgroup, [[Impassionata]], [[Lutzi]], [[CH]]
* CH!, Mastermind group, Mom-and-'em, SWs
* One of the people on reddit that I adore reached out and said hello to me today! Heart! He had amazing timing because I was melting down a bit and he is very sweet in an atypically sincere way that really strokes my spine. I am 80% certain that he has "IT," but with no way to meet, shrug.
* smokey & randy, butter, clear, flippy, volt

!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family (including ourselves)?

** Thank you for the rickroll love sonnet. I will treasure it.
** Even though it may not have been as successful as you wanted, I'm glad you tried incorporating the cake tips and tricks with the brownies - I'm glad you like doing everyday science!
** Also, I'm glad we can think together about ways to handle our various ADHD ticks, and that you're honest about what does and doesn't work for you and things worth trying.
** Thank you for doing Lent devotions with me; I like the idea of making rosaries together, too. :)

** You're doing a good job planning for the years to come. It's exciting to see our {[[Dream]]} come true.

** I had a blast with you on Saturday.
** Thank you for making rosaries with us.
** thanks for helping me think about how to deal with my (what is probably) adhd. :]

*** For knowing you such a short time, Mi Corazon, you feature in a staggeringly high concentration of Golden Amber memories. You give me hope that some day The golden glow could be over every new memory.
** You did a good job with your DCK Meditation. That is not an easy experience. I'm grateful that you are willing to undergo it. It's like a hammer. Puking sucks. <3 <3
