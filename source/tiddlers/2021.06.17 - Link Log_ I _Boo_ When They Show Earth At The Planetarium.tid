*** That conclusion is not obviously in favor of the proletariat. It's like reading a reasonable description, and then seeing which prescription you want to in it. I know what that's code for.

*** I still consider this Stage 4 reasoning (parroting the same flaws that plagues Nietzsche, despite what his [[cult]] will attempt to argue). It's a worthy problem to consider carefully. You already wrestle with quite a bit of this, and you do so admirably for your context. Semblances of Stage 5 that are sociopathic are not well-developed and fittingly integrated with The World. This is a niche theory already, and I come to it with a serious disagreement with the blackbelts. Recall what the virtue of magnanimity means: you say the truth up front. Any method that doesn't doesn't aim to do so has not respected The Reason in/of The Other. Those who think we are justified in creatively emulating sociopaths as though The Moral Law was merely an expression of the self (and plenty of Orthodox Neo-Kantians ultimately take up a constructivist anti-realist position, denouncing the noumena without having been nearly [[Straussian]] enough) are sociopaths, whether they amuse themselves by causing suffering or creating happiness theaters (be they Social or Cartesian) with no higher telos. Escaping postmodernism requires biting the metaphysical bullet. Vanishingly few do.

*** Proof of Ownership can price efficiently be the answer only given patterned redistributive justice algorithms that guarantee significant measures of equality. Automated taxations on the blockchain can do this. It doesn't work unless you have that stipulation though. Otherwise, it falls prey to standard centralization problems. The generalized form of Ethereum isn't good enough, and I don't anticipate it will evolve to be the answer (though I admire how it could). 
*** I know a manboy who looks an awful lot like this one.
