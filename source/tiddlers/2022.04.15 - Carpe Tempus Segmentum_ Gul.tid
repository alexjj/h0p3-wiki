title: 2022.04.15 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Gul

//The Flaw//. Tried sleeping at 12:30, but it took a while. Busted the fan out even (it was hot and cold at the same time), and that glorious white noise and flowing blanket took me away. 

Woke at 7:30. Head hurts, but not on fire. Had to pee like crazy, still exhausted, couldn't sleep. My mind raced at the speed of eleventy point autisms. //Skintime// with my sympaticon + planning our days. [[TTTOTW]] + Amazing leftovers with my sympaticon.

[[D2]] with my sympaticon. 5-10 LK runs between each Baal run. Pandemonium Diablo spawn glitch with Baal. IG and Merc got one-shotted on a particularly nasty Lister pop. Have another ready. Need to spend a day making as many as I can. Twerk found a skiller (heart lept for a second when I read summoner skills...`/sigh`) and a Gul. [[TTTOTW]].

Two of the consults have moved their times. =/. Yup.

[[TTTOTW]]. My sympaticon read //Saga// in the rocking chair, and we had candy eggs.

Moar [[D2]]. Another Gul! She is smoothly constructing the runs for us. Death every third or fourth run. Once she has the proper defensive style, positioning, and twitch instincts, and maybe 92, we'll move to full defensive gear, especially once we have Infinity.

//The Walk// with mi amor. Through the various translations and still thinkin' about solar. We stopped by Elaine's, and mi amor delivered a gift. She had a friend this time, a snappy ol'timer: Maria. She gave good advice. I offered my services in return. Carded. I might be directly useful to her, but also  I told her that I may also be useful to people she knew who were strong computer users, in case they were ever in an odd spot. We'll see.

[[Family Gathering]] was dope. [[ASK]] made her white and red bake, and it was the best she's made, imho. Demolished it. We only had 40 minutes, so no time for //House//. Just chilled in [[The Den]] and talked. Dialectics. My son surprised me several times. I'm glad to see he's been reading about the world. Social media theory, full stack.

Devon was chill. Fed him while he talked (my boy hadn't eaten, and it had been a long day). Carded.

Bigboi [[shared]] his baba with [[ASK]]. We've decided the tacticool wah-uh-bah-uhl is large and baby-bottle-esque, especially as we two-hand it and suck that nip hard.

//The Walk// with my sympaticon.

Artgroup. Long week. `/nod`. 56 packages. Remember: üëèthere üëèare üëèno üëèrules. Looks at everything in [[New]] and maybe [[Recent]]. Canvas textures. Proud that you just jumped in. Socks for her mom, 4 rows a day, done in a month. Raccoons are back, for a long time, apparently. [[dziggetai]]'s 32GB RAM isn't enough. Illnesses. She's going back on-site. Increasingly weirded out by flying on airplanes. Gooseberries. Elden Ring. Browser problems. Idiocracy. Allergies. Ghibli movies. What makes for a [[good]] movie? Adam Savage. Plants. Krita crash sad. Default terminal and terminator. Private wiki, not taking notes often. i3 conf. Cute nephew. 

Put mi amor to bed. A flash. Put my sympaticon to bed + //Community//. Sleep by midnight.
