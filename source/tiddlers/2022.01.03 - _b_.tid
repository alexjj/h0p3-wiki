Sometimes God is the only person who will fuck the incel.

Sane post-[[pleft]]ism is just [[pleft]]ism. We all hate long, pointless meetings that promote useless efforts, though long meetings for useful efforts are necessary. I'll agree that it's often better to ask for forgiveness than permission, but maintaining a society in which we generally should seek permission first is still our obligation. I like how they admit that peaceful protests usually only work when we're asking for something the system is already planning on giving us. I appreciate how they often recognize "progressive" conflation of many culture wars with class war (including failing to understand the root causes). I disagree with the claim that passively refusing to work sabotages the system nearly as effectively as actively working toward defeating the system. Pirating and preferring libre media makes excellent sense. Shoplifting can be [[good]] praxis.

Carefully curated, rose-tinted, fraudulent windows into the lives of [[others]]: lying is easier than ever in virtualized signaling. I actually think most people have adjusted what they even mean by unjustified deception.

raTox with logical accounts and [[anonymous]] holders and proxies, yes, please. If mutual trust, then why not hold and proxy. I'd mule for [[ASmith]] any day of the week.
