title: Links: Library

//I've my own reservations and preferences about librarians, no doubt. The ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 contains a significant hand-picked corpus (serving one's searching, [[sharing]], and MLed [[PSM]]ing, voting, and curation) with metadata already attached (with semantic content mapped onto the links in some non-obvious respects too). Seems like we should shoot for single-file (including html), uncompressed, in-file searchable archives, auto-updated & versioned (still unsure how to handle so many problems), metadata rich filenames (an uncommon sauce, imho), and arguably many more features. ML on non-textual media may provide significant results. Automatically expanding the search for contexts surrounding an archived object might be worthy as well (though its own monster).//

!! Tools

* https://github.com/iipc/awesome-web-archiving
** https://github.com/Y2Z/monolith
*** wget media files

```python
with open("index.html", 'r') as f:
        urls = re.findall('http[s]?://(?:[a-zA-Z]|[0-9]|[$-_@.&+]|[!*(),]|(?:%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]))+', f.read())
print(urls)
```

```bash
lynx -dump -listonly -nonumbers "https://philosopher.life" > links.txt
```

!! /b/

* Need a naming scheme that I really like.
* There's a ton of tooling designed for this, and I'm still not sure what the output should really be.
** single html or media files that are easy to search from the commandline and file browser
** perhaps a metadata and tooling group outside it
*** a mirror directory, archive-metadata, same names
*** OCR on images
*** speech to text where viable
* May need to proxy this. 
* Would be nice not to have cover old ground. Once it is done, leave it alone. Build checking after.
* Not convinced yet the deduping will be valuable.
* Need to automatically strip of ads...gonna have to get that tooling up and running


<br>

!! Standard Fully-Offline Archival Version of the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱

* Have the files, probably an archive directory.
* Replace each `weblink` with `[[weblink|localfile]]`
* May need to consider how to trim it down


<br>

!! A Compressed Archival Version

* Sneakernet friendliness is a must. 
* Where it shrinks, convert each html file into a self-uncompressing version (or perhaps it's time to just keep breaking it down further).
** Leaving an ability to reverse this process to make it CLI friendly would be nice. Complete self-extraction. 
* Perhaps I should set a limit, as I do with [[Music: Library]]. What can I do with 100GB? 
** How far should I strip it? Is it even feasible to easily strip it down extremely far? 
*** It loses a lot.
** I'm kinda scared about images getting out of hand (and most [[vidya]] has no place). I can reliably shrink them, and I don't mind deepfrying for this.
*** What about 50GB to non-html, text, pdf? 
* Is it feasible to retrieve everything from a single well-compressed archive file? Interacting with content locked inside from the commandline may be reasonable in many cases. 
** I'd want a in-browser based answer. 



<br>

!! Appification

* Hop, skip, and a jump from just having this Beaker-Browser'ed or going even more custom (sync expensive is a serious problem, and I'd rather be agnostic).  
* Have the browser packaged with it. Can also have the extensions/addons we think every person would benefit from.
** raTox with webui in the browser (or perhaps the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 itself). 
* Eventually, arch, junest, docker, VM.
