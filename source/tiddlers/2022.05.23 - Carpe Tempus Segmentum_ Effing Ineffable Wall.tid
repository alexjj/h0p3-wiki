<<<
//The Walk// with my sympaticon. Vapelyfe. It was a relatively quiet one.

[[TTTOTW]]. Think we ate something, but I don't recall. Sleep by 3?

Woke at 10? Meditation.

[[TTTOTW]]. 

//The Walk// with my sympaticon. Dialectics, mostly me listening.

[[TTTOTW]].

[[D2]]. Baal run, and I died on NeckRomancer. Ugh.

[[TTTOTW]].

[[Family Time]]. A difficult moment where the adults quietly struggled. We thought about each other's lives, and we chattered. Vaporwave Surreal Sad.

We watched //Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Movie//. Dadnap about 10 minutes into it. I am glad they enjoyed it. It fits the requirements.

Woke at 8?

Noodles. [[TTTOTW]]. Put mi amor to bed. 

[[D2]]: Twerk found Vex and skiller. She also had her first death on LK. Middle of a bird fanaticism extra fast pack, one shot. Good news is that timing tests show I can get the run to 14 seconds average (much lower than anyone else I've found, though I am specializing a budget character for this). 

[[TTTOTW]]. A bagel.

Sat with my sympaticon until there wasn't nothing more to say. [[TTTOTW]] with my sympaticon chillin' quietly on the couch.
<<<

[[TTTOTW]]. Tonight sucks. Yet again, I hit the effing ineffable wall.

A wild [[Yaretzi YaÃ±ez]] appears...

[[TTTOTW]]. Giving //One: Being an Investigation into the Unity of Reality and of its Parts, including the Singular Object which is Nothingness// a shot.

Sleep by 3.

Woke at 8:30. Dreams. Stomach. Commotion. Ranga brought a baby rabbit into the house (and then a bird immediately after). The household is searching for a way to help the rabbit which we probably can't keep. My sympaticon was instantly delighted to hold the bunny after e-mailing all the caretakers in a 45-minute radius that take bunnies.

Hugs'n'bugs.

More reading on //One//. I've figured what is missing. `/nod`. Same thing as always, Pinky. Priest preaches to the choir here, but still misses the boat. He's concise, precise, accurate, and pretty darn [[salient]]. Quite a combination. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

Scraping the tub (we had a medium-sized scraper I forgot about, it has helped quite a bit) and painting (I got a good amount on the floor after being clumsy) the rest of the bathroom. Every surface has been touched. I'll put 1 more coat on the lower end and one or two more in the upper bathtub area. I should be able to remount stuff (not tomorrow, as we're shopping). My sympaticon joined me. It was smooth and open.

Developer session with my daughter. She's now helping her brother with the [[Links: Library]] project. Think she wants to explore more of the tooling options (good). [[5c0ut]] joined us for a bit; it's been a productive day for him.

[[1uxb0x]] and I continued scraping the new and old coats of paint out of the tub. 

[[D2]] with my sympaticon. We built a Call to Arms (decided since we had Vex, we could combine for the missing Ohm) in a PB. It's not a good one, but it'll do the trick. Aurora does the buffing since I must use weaponswap for a TP staff (eventually, I'll do it since I've have the highest pure +skill). Can feel the difference too, across the board. Gonna keep the Druid spirit from Hoto up. Dying costs too much, and we have all the gold we could need. Ran into new hotkey bugs.

[[TTTOTW]].

//VALIS// by Philip K. Dick. Good god, a difficult opener for us. Synchronicity into a story of hell itself.

Shopping @ W-Entity with my sympaticon. Picked up Timothy Hay and a pineapple (they didn't have any cabbages except the expensive organic). Many surreal feelings.

//The Walk// with mi amor. We encountered people at the house with the cat we like. Apparently, not really their cat, just a stray that is taken care of by erryone (and exceptionally friendly for that reason). Couple outside, Stacy (she just moved here, knows no one, inebriated, just moved her parents who may have had cancer down to KY) and a man who goes by the name of [[2%]], `/wave`. He came over to talk to me, and I was asked what I enjoyed. Why, [[computing]], ofc. Carded. Man lit up. Took me straight into the house to show me his 3D printing. Psychedelic frogs, shower rings, some material that changed color. House was relaxed, roll their own cigarettes, and his office was a place where work got done. He works remotely, senior cyber security analyst, so we talked shop. Offered to get me a job. Maybe. He's got a friendly cat inside, a 17yo daughter and 13yo son (almost identical, though he's 10 years older than I am; called me a baby :P). Dinner plans, tentatively. Went outside, and a new person came by to speak with the Stacy and [[k0sh3k]]. Name was Bill. Beer and dogs, and he told me he's got two weeks left. Wife just died, and he's gotta find a 2-bedroom. Carded. Told me everything business when I said it was personal. Says he'll be in touch.

Prepped dinner with my sympaticon. I do not get the fancy cut on those onions well enough for the culinary artist, understandably. I was useful though. 

[[JRE]] called. Continued compromise invitation and a hospitable interpretation.

[[Family Gathering]] was delicious. We had kielbasa, onions, and potatoes, pineapple, as well as roasted broccoli and cauliflower (which I took all the rest of). Watched The Lung episode of //House//. My daughter was unhappy and quite expressive.

Hugs'n'bugs for the evening.

[[MTG]]. Split Gobbos in half, rolled for facedown singletons, lots of mulls on her end. Unfortunately, the rabbit made final sound and died. =(.

[[TTTOTW]]. Made a coffin for Peter. 

//The Walk// with my sympaticon. We buried peter on the forest side of the initial U. Then we went both routes. Dialectics.
