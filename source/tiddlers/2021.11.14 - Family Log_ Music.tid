!! How has your health been this week?

* 1uxb0x
** It was fine
* j3d1h
** Erratic sleep, and some mild joint pain? Otherwise decent.
* k0sh3k
** Headaches continue; back and neck are feeling better, since I've been stretching like I'm supposed to.
* h0p3
** Bit of soreness this week, but not bad. My gut is hitting my desk in a way that it has never before. I can't take a deep breath while fully under it without moving either myself or the desk now. I felt good this week. Lower libido again (however, I don't feel so worried about it): fucktons of //Skintime//! Dope.
* ASK
** I hurt my shoulder yesterday. I didn't even notice. My sleep continues to improve, not counting today.

!! What was interesting to you last week?

*Desk drama continues...but I get to camp in CA's office for at least a month!
* It was very cool to hold a sword.
* Moving [[ASK]]'s stuff into the basement went off without a hitch. It's been coming together too. 
* Artgroup was pleasant. It is my window.
* Found a blind woman who clearly adores her computer, and her chosen name is [[Hope]]. Been interesting to read about her life. Just bumped into each other, and I'm hoping we will connect further.
* Got to teach Matoune some basic art stuff.
** It's also the first decently long conversation I've had with them, a bit over an hour.

!! Outside of our immediate family, who did we have significant social interactions with? 

* [[hopesthoughts]], [[Root Users]], [[dziggetai]], Scott the Neighbor, [[Killcoin]]

** I'm happy with my work this week.
** You did a good job picking out Christmas presents for people!
** Thank you for always being willing and quick to help lug things around. :) (Like bringing in packages and whatnot.)
** I'm glad that you take the time to find new learning resources when your current resources don't work for you. Smart.
** Your assistance this week has been invaluable, and the way you always help, not just willingly, but happily, restores my faith in humanity, just a bit. Thank you.
*** NP :P
** Thank you for helping so quickly with the sink. Fixed the problem fast together.
** As someone with a crap-ton of characters, it's very handy to have an informal weapons expert nearby. :]
* j3d1h
** I like my attention to detail when creating, even in arts I'm not totally familiar with.
** You did a good job picking out Christmas presents for people!
*** (Whoadang!)
** I am glad you are the sort of person who cares about others' well-being and wants to help them.
** Thank you for doing heavy lifting to help us. I know you hate it, so it counts for extra.
** Twice this week you've generously decided to make extra food for others out of nowhere. Thank you.
** I enjoy hearing you talk shit about social media platform, IM infrastructures, NFTs, b-words, browsers, programming languages, OSes, etc. I hope you run with that deconstruction knowledge to reconstruct what we need as humans.
** Thank you for helping me try to log into minecraft.
** I love the way our interests coincide to make for hours of stimulating conversation. You would be my second favorite person in the world, were your brother not equally awesome.
*** :D
* k0sh3k
** 98 on my Greek test! I continue to do well at Greek, which makes me happy. 
** I've also been more intentional about working on all the things I need to do for my promotion and my MDiv application.
** Thank you for helping me pick out gifts.
** We're lucky that you argue with us all the way down. Thank you. You're a pruner and sharpener.
** When there is free shit to be had, you always grab us some. Thank you.
** You do a good job having difficult discussions with fam. Been a few times this week for ya.
** Your compassion this morning really helped me not have a terrible day. Thank you. I feel less alone and hopeless than I thought possible after a night like that.
** Thank you for handling the majority of the gift traffic.
* h0p3
** I click with weirdos, uniquelings, the Super Freaks, and the atypical: I'm glad to embrace it. 
** Thank you for pushing me to do laundry.
** Thank you for putting gas in my car this week.
** And for taking me out last night.
** And for listening to me play my psaltery for hours.
** There are too many nice things to choose from, but if I had to pick one; Your brilliance is a light in the dark, it brings a hope and comfort that I didn't know I could have. (You're number one)
** I have fun trashing on dem liberals with you.
*ASK
** I appreciate the effort you've taken to reach out to everyone here and get to know them and their quirks. :)
** Thank you for letting me hold a real sword, that was freaking cool.
** Thank you for making and bringing me soup and tea.
** You're exceptionally thoughtful about how you speak of others. You're careful in a way that requires having chosen to make it a habit.
** You're a very strong person. You've overcome so much in life. I'm glad you are here.
** Shopping with you is fun (and, it's not something I normally consider all that fun - it's usually a serious, energy-consuming task for me).
** I'm not claiming your computer is a reflection of you, but I really like your computer. 
**You've worked hard this week, keep it up, don't get discouraged. Try to recognize your own effort.
** You are incredibly kind without being toxically nice.
