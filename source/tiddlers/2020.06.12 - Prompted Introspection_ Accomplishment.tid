title: 2020.06.12 - Prompted Introspection: Accomplishment

!! What about your work can you take pride in?

There may be those who think pride is fundamentally vicious, but I don't see why. [[2019.03.26 - Prompted Introspection: Before The Fall]] appears [[arrogant]]. There is something recursive about trying to pridefully have humility or humbly have pride [[irwartfrr]], in the orders of picking it out, the Frankfurtian [[infinigress]] rears its ugly head again.

I like how much I accomplish each day. I feel like it's usually [[good]] enough, and that aint so bad. I still have that gnawing feeling that I didn't get everything done that I ~~should~~ wanted to get done, but I don't feel like an abject failure. That's nice. More importantly, I feel like I'm building something that matters. It's definitely long-haul.
