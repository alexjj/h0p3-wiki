!! What is the best road trip or vacation you have ever taken? Who was there? Where did you go? What did you see along the way?

I'm disappointing on the trip/vacay front. Ever met "sane" gamblers who spend all year living a shit life so they can blow their wad in Vegas for a few days, rinse and repeat for decades? That's what I think of most trip-to-life ratios I find in practice. In k(l)epitalism, comrade, it do be like that. I'm a self-sabatoging self-righteous homebody hermit though, so surely I'm jaded and blinded by my hatred for the world, lol.  

All of my favorite trips are with my wife. Just us. Did we walk on a beach, have sex, and eat good food? I've gotten to do that a few times. Those are the best. That's kinda what I try to accomplish when I'm not on a trip. Forget the beach. Plus, I'm too addicted to [[monster-16]] to be without her. Between machines and humans, I'm poly.
