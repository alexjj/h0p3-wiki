title: 2021.08.27 - MJos: Answering a couple questions

I’ve been meaning to write you again for a little while now, but it has been very busy moving to a new house.

I am now in Santa Cruz and have been for about six weeks. Make sure to update the part of your webpage that says where I live.

The chance of me going to grad school, as you ask in one of your recent letters, is 100%. The chance of me actually getting through it will depend on how well I can do with the Dragon dictation software, which the disability center set me up with a free copy of.   It’s definitely a cut above the Alternatives. Writing papers, at least, should be no problem.

As for writing code… Well, there a third party plug-ins for dragon that sit between the voice layer and the command execution layer, and let you speak a whole new set of commands for coding and various programming languages. Said sets of commands have been implemented already, so it’s just a matter of learning to use them… Anyway, the point is it’s all out there and I just have to get better at it. I’ve been preoccupied with moving in, and making the new apartment my own, but now I can settle down to a month or so of intensive practice with dragon and that should be all I need to feel confident. I’m actually pretty optimistic.

Apologies for not addressing any particular points that were in your previous letters as I don’t have your website open right now my phones about to die. I always feel like, when I read what you write, that I could reply to almost every single paragraph. Indeed, I’ve seen you do that with Kicks, chameleon, and other PSM peeps. Forgive me if I don’t live up to that standard, if my email blasts tend to mostly just be me rambling and only occasionally returning to your points. It’s not how I want to be. But I figure, suboptimal contact is better than no contact, and it’s so easy for me to lead email messaging and friend contact go if I’m not careful about it but I would rather just send something off. To let you know that I’m thinking of you.

Tomorrow is my birthday. I will spend the whole day working on DND, and coding, and maybe walking by the beach. Then at night I will drink alcohol and go dancing. It will be a very good day.
