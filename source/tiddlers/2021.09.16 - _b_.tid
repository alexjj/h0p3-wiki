Identifying less with current states and more with the being who transitions through states has its limits, where we are numbed into mere stability, approaching everything as a bland grey state of "it just is what it is," on the precipice of the [[stoic]]'s "courageous" harmony of no longer caring. Even grumpy, apathetic depression is The Way, of course. `/wink`. We learn not to take life too personally. It is much cheaper to believe the only validity is that none of it really matters in the end.

Life doesn't start when you feel like you don't owe your time to anyone else, though obviously the alienation of being a capitalist's employee boils down to spending your time and energy for someone else to realize their ambitions. In the fight against slavery, life begins when you accept your vocation as service to [[the other]]. That is maturity.

I often have an estimate of how expensive it can be to interpret my gibberish. Sometimes I enjoy predicting who thinks I'm obfuscating, bullshitting, or lacking originality; these can be keys to understanding [[the other]], especially my outgroups who have no intention of putting their skin in the game. I think it grows more complex in triangles, but these too reveal characteristics of all players in the non-mere [[game]].

oFfMyChesT: Just remember that motives are nearly instantaneous products of emotional activity only epiphenomenally related to conscious experience, and morality is merely a confabulated narrative spun after the fact to justify one's underlying self-interest leading to the mass hallucinatory spook controlling society and brainwashing people into worshiping some false idol instead of you.
