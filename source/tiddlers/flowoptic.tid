I'm happy [to speak](https://philosopher.life) with you.

Thank you for taking the time to speak with me, and I'm glad you find the spaghetti flowing out of my pockets neat. =D.

Why should we care about the way to freedom or freedom itself? Freedom for the sake of what? The freedom I'm concerned with is about binding ourselves to what matters most. Autonomy means self-legislation. It is freedom to become unfree with respect to the laws that govern at least some aspects of our lives. Even failing to use one's autonomy in some [[FO]] (first order) sense seems to be a limiting choice as well. We all demonstrate anti-freedoms.

I'm not convinced our words escape the pursuit of definition, nor do I think our communication escapes faith in a wide variety of matters.

I'll agree there are contexts in which shrugging more or insisting less is what one ought to do with one's freedom. Thank you for taking the time to prescribe to me.

> you're welcome ; ) although i can't prescribe, since we don't share a common definition of freedom.

In case you ever are interested in what I think: 

But, you have prescribed! I agree you ought not given your claims. I agree we don't share a common definition of freedom, but it doesn't look like you have a right to attempt to define it given your claims and prescriptions. In case you are implying otherwise, I also deny the claim that we can't prescribe unless we [[share]] a common definition (of freedom or otherwise). 

Let me further point out that even if you don't take yourself to be explicitly defining anything, you are implicitly doing so both for yourself, internally, and socially in this context. I am, of course, interested in what you mean by freedom (I have my guesses). I can appreciate why you want to end the conversation though. Most do. `/nod`.
