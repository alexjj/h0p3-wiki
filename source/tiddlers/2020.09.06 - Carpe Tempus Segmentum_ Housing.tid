title: 2020.09.06 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Housing

* Woke at 3
** Omg. Merciful sleep. Chaos in my dreams, but I feel rested.
* [[k0sh3k]] is in hunting mode. Seems like a house might actually be a reasonable goal. It is weird to see [[By 2022]] might still be attained.
** May go for higher crime rate areas.  
* Inform the Men!
* Shower of the gods!
* [[Family Time]] @ 4:30
* [[TTP]]s
** My daughter is not being honest again. Her attitude is going to drive me insane. She has to stand in the pocket with me to reason. Very unfun.
** Struggles with how they spend my time. Doing my best to be kind about stupidity and resistance. 
* Discussion
** Thinking about a house together
** Long-term projections
** [[Sharing]]. Thinking about the quotes. We all feel moved by them.
* 1-on-1s
** Chill. Just sitting together.
* Reading Our Wikis
** Almost nothing from my offspring. Easy to read. 
*** Shit went down though when we saw the lies.
** Reading [[k0sh3k]]s sent me flashing back through the week. Good gracious. 
*** [[Gratitude]] that she took the time to write anything at all with a week like she had.
** Mine, of course, was perfectly disgusting. =D.
* The Nightwalk
** I said little. Mostly just listened and played along. The girls are more talkative than the boys.
** Holding hands and barefeet. Jokes. Listening to [[k0sh3k]]'s clarity and interpretive insight. 
*** Reminds me of my son's compliment that we only pseudo-disagree. 
** It is official, I am my wife's sub. =)
* Offspring and I made dinner
** Having difficulty getting my son to really try to accomplish the task with us, but he is trying to be constructive. I'm glad to see it.
* The Meal
** Rice, stir fry, kimchi, pickled veggies, spicy pickles, spring rolls, coffee, and brownies
** [[Family Log]]
*** I don't see it. =/.
* Clean
* Read+Write
* AFireman Time!
* Sleep by 5
