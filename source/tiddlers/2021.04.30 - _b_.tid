Hi. 


I concur, doctor. I quote myself. I memorized this the day it came online and have quoted it ever since. The only way I'll accept the compliment that I'm a good dad is when my offspring agree that it's a good thing that I fucked their mom. (Hey, I fucked your mom.) When you can openly admit that you are glad I rawdogged her, then fine, I did a good job being a dad. Otherwise, you just get to remember this paragraph. Lmao.

<br>

I've decided I will be a sellout. I'll change the open voldemort page and transfer all intellectual property rights for 1 Trillion 2021.04.30 USDollars of global buying power, and no less. Godspeed. I will buy me a socialism. `/uh, 1 socialism, plz`

<br> 

Apparently, it is all just vision. Delightfully voracious. Fruit not a tool. Posh & More. Topiclessness is a topic. I listen with autistic [[Straussian]] ears. I feel the wind too. May your trust quotient be radical.  You let us see your flesh words fresh.  

<br>

How to be a little bit mean [[irwartfrr]]. Find that for me, please. I know one man who tried. I'm here to collect your data. Justice prevail. Yes, I would root myself for you. Rorschach me to death. Let us be stupendous together. M o o d. Style. We did it, schizo. Fluidity. It is sunshine. Yes, please. Yes! I listen to the hate of others. It is such an expensive task. Skin in the game. Others Together. It is our only hope.

Yes, I honorably accept the invitation to join you as your leading cult expert. I live in my basement. Thank you. Thank you very much. 

My Arduous Wishlist: may you build toward things children on potatoes would love using and skidding around on, one we must all use. 

<br>

Build Next Gen Plebbit From This Glittered Crosseyed Trashcan. It's insane. Ninja, I love you. There are few I would trust with my children, but you, I trust you. We gonna need curators. Bless us. I am your retard for life. The message board of the masses, I hope it is you. You got an ass that won't quit, and a mind for the gods. Annoint us all, with kitty kats, I beg you. Amen. Period. The Absolute Itself. 

Wtf, my dude. That is amazing. To the fucking nines. I'm in tears. I can't even wear a shirt, it hurts. Badass. A vision. You study an art beyond me, and I know it. Data. Human Data. That's how you fucking build it. Amen. It's my job to write what is considered crazy shit on the internet, and I love you. All the way down, no matter what. I swear to god if you ever tell me I don't love your style, I will kick your ass. `/kiss`. You Animate In Hard Places.

I do play low trust games in high trust situations. One must tame the "you will not say that." There is never an upside to speaking with the village idiot. STFU Idiot! Very expensive. I'm really enjoying The Eric Andre Show (however it is pronounced, thank you). It's smashing. God damn! DUDE.
