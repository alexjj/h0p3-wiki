title: 2020.08.25 - Tapeda: The Snuggle Is Real

//Forgive me for not responding in some spaces, and, of course, you should ignore me at-will. I'm [[grateful]] to read your work. It's not chickenscratch to me at all: it's vulnerable fire from the static, ''HUGE'' //hyperobject//ive memeplexes (with at least parts of the appearance of the thing-in-itself either incomplete or incoherent) we're both lost in, and poetry. Especially when I am not sufficiently justified, I'm afraid I won't be able to give you the words to carefully construct your quest with you well enough (and, I won't know how to tell you how much I want to be constructive with you well enough either). I'm a blind and violent wrestler sometimes, and thus I find sometimes my silence is conducive to meshing correctly, though I must learn how. I hold myself accountable to everyone with what I say to you. Telescopically, may we be wise, wiry ‚¶ófff‚¶ò scaffolds to all those who climb another's mountainous subjectivity. I am a man of some [[faith]]; I know not what it means to feel it.//

I don't know what it means to say it, but it seems, in some sense, it is the interpreter's job to pick out at least some of the references on their own. Hard to build that together safely.

Normally, I try to be more fastidious about a quote and reply style. You don't seem to miss a damn thing though (I can only think of a few other people who read that closely), so I'm going to conveniently drop that convention here.

Yeah, Reddit seems a fortunate starting place but an awful communications platform for us. Indeed, I hate Twitter too. =). You, [[kickscondor]], and now [[ASmith]] are the lone exceptions that have pulled me onto that network (not that I'm not forced to use it every day in any case in order to just read). I have many complaints about the structure of Discord, but it may provide the editing that you find useful (and I'm easily reached on it): h0p3#[[REDACTED]].<<ref "i">> In addition, I would like to read your Tiddlywiki, if you wanted to make one. I'm unable to guess at your technical skill and preferences in this sphere. For all I know, you've got all the tooling ramps you'll ever need.

I do my best to [[REDACT|REDACTED]] for folks (though it is uncommon). I see non-trivial vulnerability in your constructive schizoposting,<<ref "s">> and I aim to protect that. To my knowledge, you aren't a [[Root User]] (so I'm not going to delete it), but I'll encrypt it. I never hope to be an observer of merely a giant meatgrinder (though my wiki is often like this in trying to write it).

Again, you don't miss a damn thing, lol. That Carmack feller defined my childhood non-trivially. I know he's a legend. I see bits of him from time to time in surfing too. I wouldn't be surprised if he were able to engineer something practically amazing (surely, he is a master of many theories). At least at first glance, however, Bach interests me more. I despise podcasts, but that episode was excellent. Thank you. What will it mean to ML our work?

I am trying to understand the concept, dependencies, and consequences of qualia as effectively as I can. I'm wholly unoriginal and insane here; I don't think there's any escaping that for at at least 32% of it.<<ref "m">> I like symbols too (not that I understand them well enough). `0` is my favorite number and numeral. Although, I do hope the 0(s) and 1(s) fuck, üëâüëåüí¶. 

I am interested in your concept of Babel, Babble, and even the seemingly disturbing topic of Speaking In Tongues (and, I often like those coincidences in which different things sound similar).

I only write to retain, retrain, and refactor till the minimal structure of what I felt, feels left.

I am [[grateful]] to hear your expositional contributions in our [[hyperconversation]]. Do you mean that literally, btw? Does that apply to that sentence? Does that apply in the context of our discussion, and what are the implications of that? I'll agree it may be inescapably part of what positivist intelligence brings to wisdom. I'll agree that we are each capable of writing to and for ourselves. I also would like to understand your feelings about test-driven development. It seems like it could expand [[W5H]] you //will// feel too, growing a map of the territory (but perhaps that is also already embedded in what you felt in some senses and motivations). I am interested in [[salience]] as it relates to [[antipleonasms]] (or reductions or compressions or whatever is the particularistic fitting term here), and then it seems like there's more worth saying about our feelings. Seems like we have to oscillate here in curiosity. [[This|2018.07.06 - PPP: Mathematical Platonism]] may just be a noisy {[[dream]]} of mine, I don't know.
