//Apparently, according to these egoistic Rand-Locke memeplex agents and [[cult]]ic self-idol-worshipers who have cloaked themselves under the guise of many [[names]] through history, the following has been validated by their Market God in the war of all against all.//<<ref "i">>

* The market is the most efficient information processor^^tm^^. Hence, truth, inferences, facts, values, cultures, beliefs, desires, attitudes, identities, theories of [[The Good]], resource [allocation, acquisition, and transfer], [[power]], and justification can only be validated by the market.
;
* Market society both descriptively //is// and prescriptively //should be// the natural and inexorable state of humankind.
;
* Perfectly free markets may not always occur naturally and must be actively constructed through alternative political organizing. The political goal is not to destroy the state, but to take control of it, and to redefine its structures and functions, in order to create and maintain the reign of unbridled markets and market-friendly cultures at all costs.
;
* Ideally, there is no contradiction between public/politics/citizen and private/market/entrepreneur-consumer because the latter should sublate the former.
;
* Justice is the freedom to choose to acquiesce to the imperatives of the market, i.e. to obey those who dominate the market through ~~exploitation~~ their own brilliance and hard work.
;
* Capital, as an object, has a natural right to be injected into or flow freely across all political boundaries.
;
* Inequality of resources, income, wealth, and political rights is a good thing because it prompts productivity. 
;
* Corporations can do no wrong because competition eliminates wrong-doers and wrong-doing.
;
* The market is the solution to problems caused by the market, including the centralization of power into oligopoly or monopoly.
