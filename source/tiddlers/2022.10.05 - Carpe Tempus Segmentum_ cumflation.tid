title: 2022.10.05 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: cumflation

Woke at 2. Meditation. No brix. Millennial toast, noodles, and ginger ale. [[TTTOTW]] + LolVods.

Saw mi amor off. She's stayin' up late again. =). A billion things this week, including 5 morning services she's running. 

Lolvods + //Skintime// with my sympaticon. Couldn't stay awake any longer.

Woke at 12ish? 

//The Walk// with my sympaticon. Short route (been a while). Good. 

Didn't have to wait long at the door. Nurse asked me if I was professor. No. Just an autist, ma'am. She asked me where I was, saying I was too polite to be from here. `/nod`. Solid tableside manner; she's good at asking questions, and she made several good inferences from her databases. Kinda hawt. Third round of covid vaccines and flushot. Said it was a pleasure to meet me, which is uncommon. 

Spent two hours talking macroeconomics with my offspring. Walking downtown. We had pizza and ice cream (which I owed them). 

Offspring came down to grind. [[5c0ut]] was chillin' with us. He has done his best to protect Jaron, and may have been able to save him again. `/thumbs-up`. Excel spreadsheets appear pretty useful here. Making life a bit easier on himself during ordering for the surprise event tomorrow. Phillip asked him to smoke up on the job to chill some. We are, of course, profoundly sensitive and wired people. 

Brix. Finally, real logs (not yet bricks*). Some //Rick and Morty// with my sympaticon. Fell asleep.

Woke to mi amor's call. She has worked the entire day, literally. Not going to be pouring nearly as much in Greek at this point, since she has all the tooling she needs for her job, can pass the class, and so it's time to make life somewhat easier. Thinking about midterms and papers. Given that a sermon must be generated from the first paper (and given her focus on practical theology), and the value of a good impression here, some selection is worthwhile. Need to thank Duane for making this cake; I was never even remotely prepared for grad school as effectively as she has been. 

Chilled with her while she tried them tom yum noodles. There are now enough people in the house that have given me the greenlight to stock hard on these. Dirt cheap, damned good. 

Chats with [[sabaLynx]]. Lolvods + //Skintime// with my sympaticon. Pita sammiches. LolVods. [[TTTOTW]]. Brought session up just for [[search_social]], but neither of us can connect. `/shrug`.
