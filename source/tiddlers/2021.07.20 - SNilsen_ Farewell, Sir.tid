title: 2021.07.20 - SNilsen: Farewell, Sir

"""
[9:53 AM] h0p3: I'm going to be leaving this platform soon, Sven. It's been an honor to be able to read this server (and it's one of the few I'm going to miss). That link caught my eye too. I hope to see more work from you on Saints Kant, Hegel (seems like you are already doing that, imho), Spinoza, and Leibniz, should you ever have the chance. Here's what I've got on power: https://philosopher.life/#Power
[9:56 AM] Sven Nilsen: @h0p3 thanks! I keep hearing about Hegel on some philsophical reading groups and starting to get curious about his ideas

[10:26 AM] Sven Nilsen: @h0p3 perhaps you'll find the Continental Philosophy Server https://discord.gg/ykc5SQ4 interesting

[9:39 PM] h0p3: Yes, sir. Thank you. That is one of the servers I'll be leaving when I leave this platform, sadly.
[9:40 PM] h0p3: I'd like to know your unreserved opinions and guesses on the concept of incompatibilist libertarian free will.
[9:51 PM] h0p3: I'd also like to know your intuitions about the relationship between morality and epistemic normativity.
[9:58 PM] h0p3: I'm piling on more questions (ignore them all at-will please). What do you have to say about Saint GÃ¶del's ontological proof?
[10:11 PM] h0p3: What does your theory have to say about the hard problem of consciousness? (there are tidbits strewn throughout #general here). What about qualia? You say precious little directly about it.
[10:20 PM] h0p3: Can you point me anywhere to think about The Golden Rule? I have a tendency to pragmatically reduce it down to something like Gradualized Tit-For-Two-Tats (but I'm a novice). https://www.jasss.org/20/4/12.html. Have you encountered any MLed work on this kind of problem?
[10:24 PM] h0p3: You have ten trillion dollars to build the new world order (:P). How do you build a high-performance liquid democracy, where the infrastructure is owned and operated by the people as much as is feasible?
[10:39 PM] h0p3: What are the leading consensus and voting methods in your eyes? Similarly, what are the best algorithmic approaches to decentralizing curation and moderation of The Great Human Conversation?
[10:43 PM] h0p3: You have said before, "Good is altruistic of cooperative on behalf of another Self." Perhaps that was in a narrower context than what I'm interested in (though it doesn't have to be!). Since I met you through a discussion of Plato's Cave, I'd like to know what you think about his crowning achievement as a philosopher (to my blind eyes). What is goodness? What is the best way to speak of it?

[10:10 AM] Sven Nilsen: oh, challenges! I love this
[10:12 AM] Sven Nilsen: I am probably in the compatibilist camp about free will
[10:12 AM] Sven Nilsen: the way I see it, you can't have free will without having choices
[10:13 AM] Sven Nilsen: so, the world must be determined to some degree to produce choices
[10:13 AM] Sven Nilsen: it's the meta-knowledge of determinism which creates room for free will
[10:14 AM] Sven Nilsen: "free will" is a concept that is grounded in a different language than fundamental physics
[10:15 AM] Sven Nilsen: this language is inconsistent, kind of like AI behaviour trees are inconsistent,
but it might be consistent up to some level of resolution
[10:16 AM] Sven Nilsen: it is very common that pragmatic languages have weakened notions of consistency
[10:16 AM] Sven Nilsen: now, there is a question about responsibility and free will
[10:17 AM] Sven Nilsen: if Alice does a crime, then is Alice responsible for doing it?
[10:17 AM] Sven Nilsen: this can also be viewed negatively
[10:17 AM] Sven Nilsen: if Alice does a crime, then is anyone else responsible for doing it?
[10:17 AM] Sven Nilsen: when judging Alice as not responsible, it is neither justice to punish anyone else
[10:20 AM] Sven Nilsen: you can't blame society for a crime that an individual commits,
without assigning some responsibility to the individual
[10:21 AM] Sven Nilsen: nobody can blame physical laws, because we can't punish physical laws
[10:21 AM] Sven Nilsen: punishment is part of reinforcement learning and a social signal
[10:22 AM] Sven Nilsen: it also happens before the moment of committing a crime
[10:22 AM] Sven Nilsen: e.g. I make fun of Trump, before he commits the crime, because I know he will
[10:23 AM] Sven Nilsen: bad people keep doing bad stuff, and good people keep doing good stuff
[10:23 AM] Sven Nilsen: sadly, that's part of how genes work
[10:25 AM] Sven Nilsen: a person that is born a psychopath is unfortunate and psychopaths don't respond to negative reinforcement
[10:25 AM] Sven Nilsen: so, the reason one makes fun of psychopaths, is to prevent other people from being controlled by them, because that's the only way to stop very bad things from happening
[10:26 AM] Sven Nilsen: it's very sad that a person is just born that way and you know it's in the genes,
and you are "unfair" to that person just because you want to save other people
[10:27 AM] Sven Nilsen: however, history shows over and over that when psychopaths get power, it ends with mass graves
[10:28 AM] Sven Nilsen: so, the question of blaming and punishment is always a game that takes place in an ethical grayzone
[10:29 AM] Sven Nilsen: I am fortunate to be born a good person, and so is the world
[10:29 AM] Sven Nilsen: because if I were born a bad person with my level of intelligence,
it would be very bad for the world
[10:31 AM] Sven Nilsen: among humans a minority are psychopaths and a minority are highly intelligent
[10:32 AM] Sven Nilsen: that's fortunate, because it's the intelligent psychopaths that are extremely dangerous
[10:33 AM] Sven Nilsen: the norms we have of ethics are based on the majority of people
[10:33 AM] Sven Nilsen: the majority are not psychopaths, but neither are they highly intelligent
[10:35 AM] Sven Nilsen: another way my views diverges from incompatiblistic free will,
is that I suspect that events in the world are highly influenced by an extreme observer selection effect
[10:35 AM] Sven Nilsen: this extreme observer selection effect might maximise freedom of degrees seen from a subjective view
[10:36 AM] Sven Nilsen: a tiny amount of these freedom of degrees amounts to "free will"
[10:36 AM] Sven Nilsen: however, in the big picture, that "free will" would not occur had it not been for an underlying determinism for the extreme observer selection effect to act on
[10:37 AM] Sven Nilsen: one can call this an anthropic compatibilistic position about free will
[10:38 AM] Sven Nilsen: I believe what we call "free will" is approximately real in some sense, but it is rare
[10:39 AM] Sven Nilsen: it only applies in situations that are sparsely distributed through space-time
[10:39 AM] Sven Nilsen: therefore, I don't believe that free will is grounded in or fundamental to e.g. quantum physics
[10:42 AM] Sven Nilsen: eventually quantum physics is important for the extreme observer selection effect I am talking about, but I view free will as an emergent phenomena that is not significant at the scales where we apply quantum physics directly
[10:44 AM] Sven Nilsen: with order words, there are few people in the world compared to trees and rocks
[10:44 AM] Sven Nilsen: trees and rocks don't have "free will" in the sense the people have
[10:45 AM] Sven Nilsen: the genes people have influences their behaviour,
so although a person can have choices, it doesn't mean those choices are good
[10:46 AM] persona: (I'm here listening, btw...I'm not arguing. Literally, just interested in your thoughts.)
[10:46 AM] Sven Nilsen: a bad person keeps doing bad stuff because the bad choices the person has are highly probable due to the genes that the person is born with
[10:48 AM] Sven Nilsen: the environment also influences people's behaviour through reinforcement learning
[10:49 AM] Sven Nilsen: a highly intelligent person might produce good outcomes in environments that most people would only see bad choices
[10:50 AM] Sven Nilsen: so, if the environment is bad for people, then the rational thing to do is to distribute power among the highly intelligent people which have good genes
[10:51 AM] Sven Nilsen: if the environment is good for people, then markets are more efficient
[10:52 AM] Sven Nilsen: no person, even highly intelligent, can beat systems at their best
[10:53 AM] Sven Nilsen: that's why I study mathematical languages, to leverage my intelligence into systems
[10:55 AM] Sven Nilsen: if I had ten trillions dollar, I would:
- develop a new economic system with a built-in Gini solver
- develop and deploy EMRS
- research smart nano-materials that can be produced in layers and composed with each other
[10:56 AM] Sven Nilsen: today, when you buy milk in the store, it is produced from a cow through highly inefficient means
[10:57 AM] Sven Nilsen: I want the milk to be produced by smart nano-materials, processing molecules in layers, which can be done much more efficiently and faster
[10:57 AM] Sven Nilsen: so, the entire milk production of a country can be replaced by a small factory
[10:58 AM] Sven Nilsen: food should be free and distributed efficiently
[10:59 AM] Sven Nilsen: the right to food be signed into law and the land that is used for monotonic plant production should be turned back into forests and grass lands
[11:00 AM] Sven Nilsen: houses should be produced to be easily moved around in modules
[11:00 AM] Sven Nilsen: so people could live where they want, moving their entire house instead of packing stuff
[11:01 AM] Sven Nilsen: that idea about houses was Jacque Fresco's, seems obvious
[11:02 AM] Sven Nilsen: factories should be made autonomous and owned through a publicly owned stock exchange
[11:03 AM] Sven Nilsen: the stock exchange should have a fee on transactions that is used to pay for education and elderly care
[11:04 AM] Sven Nilsen: roads should be built underground, which is possible with electric vehicles
[11:04 AM] Sven Nilsen: clothes should be made from fibers produced by trash
[11:05 AM] Sven Nilsen: hmm... I think that's about it
[11:06 AM] persona: Very generous answers. Thank you.
[11:06 AM] Sven Nilsen: I'm not familiar with epistemic normativity
[11:06 AM] Sven Nilsen: yeah, GoÌdel's ontological proof of God's existence
[11:07 AM] Sven Nilsen: well, one problem is that he used first-order logic
[11:07 AM] Sven Nilsen: although you can talk about e.g. a supreme being, doesn't mean you are talking about the world
[11:08 AM] Sven Nilsen: because first-order logic has the property that you can't prove that you are talking about the world
[11:08 AM] Sven Nilsen: in order to do that, you have interpret the logic
[11:09 AM] Sven Nilsen: so, the problem is that even you proved that God exists,
you can't prove that God exists within the world or relative to it
[11:09 AM] Sven Nilsen: that would require an interpretation, to ensure one is not talking about some imaginary place
[11:13 AM] Sven Nilsen: I have been thinking about qualia a lot, but it is still a mystery to me
[11:14 AM] Sven Nilsen: one thing I learned from analytic idealism of Bernado Kastrup, is that
you can be conscious without knowing you are conscious
[11:14 AM] Sven Nilsen: introspection seems to me to be required to have qualia that one is aware of
[11:15 AM] Sven Nilsen: so, in Dyon I have a mechanism for concurrency which lets one subscribe to function calls,
which can be used as a a way to "listen in" to what a program is doing
[11:16 AM] h0p3: (what inner/outer problems here you are worried about?)
[11:17 AM] Sven Nilsen: I think that's one step closer to understanding that form of computation that happens in consciousness, but it is very far yet from being satisfactory
[11:17 AM] Sven Nilsen: can you elaborate on what you mean by inner/outer problems?
[11:20 AM] h0p3: I'm not sure. There seem like a lot of problems that might arise in trying to be aware of it. I was wondering if your tooling for constructing mathematical languages might be crucial here.
[11:20 AM] h0p3: Must qualia be computed?
[11:20 AM] Sven Nilsen: one kind of problem is that computation in the brain is always going on
[11:21 AM] Sven Nilsen: it never stops
[11:21 AM] Sven Nilsen: so, to be aware of some thoughts requires "listening in" to thoughts going on
[11:22 AM] h0p3: Is it possible to listen in without affecting?
[11:22 AM] Sven Nilsen: it is in a model where you can subscribe to messages at some "waypoints"
[11:23 AM] Sven Nilsen: so, the listener doesn't know everything that is going on
[11:23 AM] Sven Nilsen: it's like a city where you don't follow traffic in and out of buildings or along blocks,
only where traffic meets other traffic
[11:24 AM] Sven Nilsen: we might have evolved to only be aware of thoughts in a specific way that is important for survival
[11:25 AM] Sven Nilsen: maybe we are "just a little bit conscious" :yum:
[11:26 AM] h0p3: Do you think we have evolved to identify with our beliefs and desires such that we aim to protect those, that our initial survival mechanisms are leveraged to protect not just our genes, but also our memes?
[11:26 AM] Sven Nilsen: that's something I'm trying to understand through symbols of power
[11:26 AM] h0p3: Yes, sir.
[11:27 AM] Sven Nilsen: it seems that humans shape an identity with an abstract origin
[11:27 AM] Sven Nilsen: the abstract origin works like a fix-point, which creates a stable gradient
[11:27 AM] Sven Nilsen: we evolved to search for this abstract origin and hold onto it
[11:28 AM] h0p3: Do you consider that evolution primarily WEIRD or more universal across our species (and would it hold for any similarly sapient species?)?
[11:29 AM] Sven Nilsen: that it is weird, or is this an abbreviation?
[11:29 AM] h0p3: Western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic
[11:30 AM] Sven Nilsen: I did not understand the question
[11:30 AM] Sven Nilsen: how is evolution related to western culture?
[11:31 AM] h0p3: Sorry. My fault. Let's say I'm obsessed with obeying abstract, seemingly impersonal rules, as almost a practical worship of propositions (or rather to that which they correspond). Nothing rugged or ethnocentric about it: I see myself as an individual seeking universal principles while chafing against conforming to mere conventions of others that aren't in pursuit of what is objective, essential, and universal, Otherness Itself (we all stand in relation to it).
[11:31 AM] h0p3: Let's say that is what is essential to WEIRDness.
[11:31 AM] Sven Nilsen: ah
[11:32 AM] h0p3: Is that what you are picking out roughly in this abstract origin, or what is the difference?
[11:32 AM] Sven Nilsen: yeah, good question
[11:32 AM] Sven Nilsen: I haven't thought for very long about symbols of power
[11:32 AM] Sven Nilsen: so, how these manifests themselves across cultures is very interesting
[11:33 AM] Sven Nilsen: I think there is a pattern to it that seem genetic
[11:33 AM] Sven Nilsen: the same pattern occurs in various forms, so it could be a faculty of the brain
[11:34 AM] Sven Nilsen: a person that lives for music isn't that different from a person living for mathematics
[11:34 AM] Sven Nilsen: they both seek harmony and undecidable higher order
[11:34 AM] Sven Nilsen: it's like, no matter what is central to a person's life, they exhibit similar behaviour around it
[11:36 AM] Sven Nilsen: all cultural patterns have their "avatars"
[11:37 AM] Sven Nilsen: people who are seen as manifestations of the values of that culture
[11:37 AM] Sven Nilsen: yet, people don't put those avatars at the highest level of authority
[11:38 AM] Sven Nilsen: they seem to believe that the source of authority comes from the abstract origin
[11:38 AM] Sven Nilsen: e.g. you can just say "science" to some people and they get euphoric emotions
[11:39 AM] Sven Nilsen: also Don Norman observed that a lot of cultural differences are only apparent
[11:40 AM] Sven Nilsen: it depends on how one selects examples from the data
[11:40 AM] Sven Nilsen: he found that both eastern and western cultures had similar examples,
but that when one culture compared itself to another they chose different examples
[11:42 AM] Sven Nilsen: it's like, when you see the world through some lens,
you like some things about it and don't like other things,
but when you change the lens some things you like become things you don't like
[11:42 AM] Sven Nilsen: so, when a culture compares itself to another,
they pick a lens and then they point out things they don't like about the other culture
[11:43 AM] Sven Nilsen: but within the culture, there might be examples of both cases
[11:43 AM] Sven Nilsen: there are both apples and oranges in both cultures
[11:45 AM] Sven Nilsen: one example I can think of e.g. hinduism vs catolism
[11:46 AM] Sven Nilsen: both religions have abstract origins, symbols of power that are similar
[11:46 AM] Sven Nilsen: kharma serves the same role as God watching you
[11:46 AM] Sven Nilsen: gods in hinduism might be compared to saints in catolism
[11:47 AM] Sven Nilsen: avatars of the core symbol
[11:48 AM] Sven Nilsen: an alien might not see the difference at first
[11:49 AM] Sven Nilsen: "ah, so kharma is something that is not assigned to a god, now I get it"
[11:52 AM] Sven Nilsen: in India women wear a dot on their forehead, while in USA they wear a cross hanging in a necklace
[11:53 AM] Sven Nilsen: btw, Don Norman compared websites and products, not religions or cultures
[11:53 AM] Sven Nilsen: I'm just applying his idea to a new domain
[11:57 AM] h0p3: Should we peel apart personhood from intelligence+intentionality? Do you think the pursuit of harmony and undecidable higher order will be found in a hypothetical alien or even AGI/ASI?
[11:57 AM] Sven Nilsen: it might be possible that two ASIs might "fall in love" in a platonic sense
[11:58 AM] Sven Nilsen: it is because ASIs are very expensive to simulate
[11:58 AM] Sven Nilsen: so, interacting with each other through game playing provides mutual cooperative benefits
[11:58 AM] h0p3: Do you think that is the pursuit of beauty?
[11:58 AM] Sven Nilsen: the games ensures that the ASIs doesn't harm each other
[11:59 AM] Sven Nilsen: beauty is often a side effect, a trace that occurs in optimal systems
[11:59 AM] Sven Nilsen: so, looking for beauty often leads to optimal systems
[12:00 PM] Sven Nilsen: understanding beauty is instrumental to ASIs
[12:00 PM] h0p3: Do you think there is a Telos to all things?
[12:01 PM] Sven Nilsen: it's the first time I've heard to Telos, but I looked it up
[12:01 PM] Sven Nilsen: I think that Telos is mistaken
[12:01 PM] Sven Nilsen: there is a path to all things
[12:02 PM] Sven Nilsen: a path has an end-point, but the end-point is not always important
[12:02 PM] Sven Nilsen: sometimes the path in between is more important
[12:03 PM] h0p3: Can that journey or process function as a telos, perhaps of a different kind or order?
[12:03 PM] Sven Nilsen: yes, that's just homotopy Telos
[12:03 PM] Sven Nilsen: in general, stuff that is associated with points have their homotopy analogue
[12:04 PM] Sven Nilsen: the "undecidable higher order" is closely related to homotopy
[12:04 PM] Sven Nilsen: homotopy is the geometric realisation of higher order
[12:04 PM] Sven Nilsen: a point is the geometric realisation of undecidable
[12:05 PM] Sven Nilsen: to the extent some thing has a Telos, to that extent it is undecidable
[12:05 PM] h0p3: That is quite a claim. Thank you.
[12:06 PM] Sven: :blush:
[12:07 PM] Sven Nilsen: I also thought about the golden rule
[12:08 PM] Sven Nilsen: https://advancedresearch.github.io/blog/2017-05-29-golden-rationality
[12:09 PM] Sven Nilsen: the golden rule is about symmetry of utility functions
[12:09 PM] h0p3: I missed this one!
[12:09 PM] h0p3: Thank you.
[12:10 PM] Sven Nilsen: in a game, you can have a symmetry that is seemingly violating the golden rule,
but because it is just a game, it works a golden rule at the meta level
[12:10 PM] Sven Nilsen: e.g. competitive games are not "do to others what you want others to do you"
[12:11 PM] Sven Nilsen: however, it is similar
[12:11 PM] Sven Nilsen: "follow the rules of the game if you want others to follow the rules"
[12:11 PM] h0p3: Indeed. Recognizing we are not an exception to the moral law appears to be at the core.
[12:12 PM] Sven Nilsen: the golden rule is at the infinite meta level of games
[12:12 PM] Sven Nilsen: the meta level which there is no higher meta level
[12:13 PM] h0p3: I love you, Sven. :slight_smile:
[12:13 PM] Sven Nilsen: it's the rule that you have to introduce to keep the fun playing all these games
[12:14 PM] Sven Nilsen: @h0p3 I hope you'll stay a bit longer, enjoying talking to you

[12:22 PM] h0p3: You are a skilled philosopher, Sir Nilsen. Thank you for taking the time to answer my many absurd questions so thoughtfully, humbly, and honestly. I'm indebted to you. `/bow`.
