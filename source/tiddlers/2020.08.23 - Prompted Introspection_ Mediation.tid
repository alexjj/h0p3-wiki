title: 2020.08.23 - Prompted Introspection: Mediation

!! What kinds of videos do you like to watch?

I've modified the question from [[2019.11.30 - Prompted Introspection: Kind of Program]]. While I speak of TV, that term has been ambiguous and incomplete for over a decade for me in practice. [[vidyas]] is a fine example. While I don't crawl The Youtubes like some folks, I have spent my fair share of time on it (and other sites that host their own video and animated image content). I will dispense with the usual philosophical problematics and consider how effectively I have wasted my time with this drug. Yum.

I feel I've enjoyed a wide range of video, though video meant for commoners.<<ref "i">> Lately, I've been enjoying Tiktok. I'll be happy to condemn its use, but I am obligated to go where people are in some cases. Before [[Afterschool Teaching]], I couldn't even stomach it. It's what my public kids use though, and insofar as the medium is the message (however it is shaped and used beyond the users), I sense not just FOMO in [[The Great Human Conversation]], but even a lack of empathy without having engaged it as openly as I can muster. I'm a sucker for trash and treasure on Tiktok like everyone else. Parasociality is not conceptually inauthentic, immoral, or problematic, though surely this problem arises too often on that network. There's something to be said for having windows, performances, and ritual bonding, even if mediated through agents and tooling I despise. I'm [[grateful]]. It's Humanizing for me.
