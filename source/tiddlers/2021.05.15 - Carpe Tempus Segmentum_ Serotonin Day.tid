title: 2021.05.15 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Serotonin Day

[[TTTOTW]] and a pear. Fireman Time! LolVod + leftover chili and chips. Son was up in the kitchen at 3am. He said he was alright. =/. Very unlike him. [[TTTOTW]].

Late into the morning speaking with [[dziggetai]] in VC. `/salute`. Sleep by 7:30, woke at 2. Offspring on task! (And with good atittudes, like they were having fun getting their shit done...awesome). [[TTTOTW]].

Broski chilled with me a bit. ⁸Δ⁸. Talked about his successful #adulting today. He's doing what it takes to secure residence in the state. I hit a bowl of 10x Lady Salvia in the gravity accordian bong bukket; took 3 attempts to burn it all.<<ref "m">> It cools down beautifully, and you can hit it without coughing (I was actually able to hold it, which is more necessary for this substance). Distinct close-eyed, much closer to DMT-style machines, and only traces open-eyed (though could simply be an HPPD trigger). There's a distinct feeling inside my skull though (and that open something, I can't put my finger on it, in my [[phenomenology]]), and now I have a marker-filter-feeling for when I'm on the substance (shrooms has one too).<<ref "s">>

//Skintime// and Assisted Fireman Time! Wife reminded me that we need to take le saturn to get checked. I smell bad too. Need shower, retard.

Bad news: my wife IDed the absurdly fast growing plant next to our house (that we also see on our walk), and it's Japanese knotweed. We might end up destroying our [[Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden]] to answer it, as it's an actual danger to the foundation of the house. Hard to answer it too. Aside: it's quite clear that Google is serving by IP. My wife's results are showing.<<ref "j">>

Simultaneous matches of [[magic]] with my offspring. +2, +1 Gobbos vs son's multi-Timewalk 4xMox Sapphire MUC,<<ref "muc">> but it was just plain beatdown (nothing trixy). 0, -1 Delver vs Clampfinity, neither were close (double PoP pwn in g2 t4). Missing a Piledriver =/. I'm feeling like we should rebuild the cube completely; why not proxy exactly what we want? My daughter is interested in Commander (what her friends are most likely to play), but not interested in constructing a deck. Aight. Their netzoomer speak is splendiferous. 

[[Family Gathering]] was odd, it was an outing (sans [[5c0ut]] who was dog-tired). We don't fucking "go out" (that's for losers, ofc). Offspring received their first shots. We did our best to avoid the media (news crews, pigs, and pretty faces),<<ref "t">> and we talked about the structures around us. My son's handwriting has improved, but his speed is not there. Ice cream was served, free frisbee (we should sometime), and we left the offspring to handle acquiring their loot while hit the liquor store for ours. Then we hit W-Entity, offspring did their own thing, and we picked up odds and ends. My daughter said it was "serotonin day," a really good one. 

//Skintime// + //The Office//, pizza + salad, and more //Skintime// + //The Office//. 

[[TTTOTW]].
