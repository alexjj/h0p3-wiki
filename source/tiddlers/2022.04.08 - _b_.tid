The Spectacular Event can sometimes be like magnets introduced to a pile of metal shavings in which polarized people snap to attention, ready to serve an invisible force, with each individual firmly believing they are acting alone and not in emergent concert.

<br>

Traumatized control-freak perfectionist carrying the mountains meant to be climbed, in need of constant reassurance. Random panics over what seems insignificant to the normie, and loud noises gonna make ya flinch. Paranoically stuck in high alert, full shields up defensive mode, overthinking every conversation over the years, obsessively searching for what's wrong, and chronically apologizing. Either no boundaries or only boundaries, as whatever is revealed will surely only be used against them. Weary of Trojan horse gifts or favors, there's always a hidden cost or motive. A desperate people-pleaser, listening and loving people while believing (if not knowing) there's not a chance the other would ever even attempt to reciprocate. Avoiding conflict and just fading into the background rather than stirring negative feelings. An expert in hiding one's existence, presence, or feelings on command with an ability to predict who's coming and what they are want, think, and feel with too few clues. Cold, detached, closed off, emotional numbness in the face of bad things: seen enough shit that you aren't fazed or won't allow yourself to be openly hurt again. Commits to anyone who shows even the barest minimum of human empathy, but helplessly convinced attachments only ever lead to suffering. Happy memories of their molestation, groomed for future abusers, drawn to all they've ever known.

With a Weak Pareto, if we can make someone better off and no one worse off, we should (though, close inspection of the costs of anything in physics should demonstrate this rule to be nearly vacuous). Further, we should value the welfare of every generation equally, as best we can. We cannot prove the existence of an ethical system which satisfies both conditions without using the axiom of choice. If we use only the real numbers, then we can't construct an ethical system which obeys both assumptions, however, we can find such a system if we use the hyperreal numbers. Though you don't need to use discounting if you're dealing with streams of utility with infinite value; instead you can assign and compare utilities with the hyperreal numbers (and surreals may be even more elegant and expressive).

//Difference and Repetition//, differentiation and integration, selection and mutation: operations of evolutionary processes and the precision of [[change]] give rise to another Hermenuetic Circle/Spiral as a peculiar line of inquiry, quests of epistemic desire that can mutate their own mutability by asking questions about their own questions.

Bayesian updates only bring you closer to the truth if the true model is in the space of those you are updating, and, of course, probabilistic justification can lead to one becoming ever more convinced of a false model (and shockingly, it may even possibly be true, into [[The Dialetheia]] itself). Epistemic justification cannot be validated, satisfied, completed, or non-positivistically evaluated for further justification by internalism or strictly empirical externalism. Slaves to the problem of representation.
