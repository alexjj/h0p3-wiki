!! How has your health been this week?

* 1uxb0x
** Relaxed-not great not awful on just about every part I know of, except stress-I didn't have any above-minor stressful moments.
* j3d1h
** decent. need to remember iron.
* k0sh3k
** Good, for the most part. Vacation is nice.
* h0p3
** Sleepless nights, plenty of rumination, splooshy poops, but overall good. Well-rested even.
* ASK
** I slept so much, almost as much as a normal person would. It made me feel like crap and I do not recommend it. I overworked myself a bit (a lot, as usual) and my body felt, and feels like I got hit by a truck. I want a hot tub. I am glad to have a garden . I remember that I dreamed. That means my brain is healing well. Overall, definite improvement.

!! What was interesting to you last week?

* One of [[5c0ut]]'s bosses was a dick. [[5c0ut]]'s not giving up though, and he knows he can do the job.
* [[k0sh3k]] tried out adderall. Cool drug bro.
** It seemed to work. I'm gonna talk to my doctor about it.
*** errybody get high
* Apparently, we should sell the SUV.
* Trip to [[JRE]]'s was successful. Nephews are cute (per [[Madman's Photo Slideshow]]), and finally got to hold my brother [[JRE]].
* //A Canticle for Leibowitz//.
* AC in car may be dying. `/sigh`. 
* Cheezecayke!
* Finally got some spicy food, thank God.
* Loved spending time with JRE and Rb; just chilling is the best thing ever.
* Diving Into Divinity is good!
* My week spent with family was great! I got to play a few new games which I liked-one stood out especially, which was neat because it reminded me and others of dos2 (the game.) I'm finally going to try doing TOTALLY LEGAL LEGIT ACQUISITION of stuff. Meeting our cousins was great! They liked hanging around me-especially the younger one. Their sleep schedule did not, however, go well with ours (go to sleep at 1, wake up at 6 for us.) My aunt was interesting to be with-I helped her with the kids. She accurately predicted we'd eat the poptarts up, though I probably ate over half :>. I also got to see my uncle at work, though I was a bit rude and stayed in the car for a bit of it. I enjoyed all of the junk food. My gut a little less.
** You sure did like those Poptarts.
* Marty's Barn
* Got to see a place I wasn't supposed to see. I broke the law, and I am very cool.
* Coming back was wonderful. I missed my family who stayed.
* 2-3 year old boys have a lot of energy. Suck the oxygen out of the room. I don't know how parents do it, even though I've somehow managed to do it before.
* This week was pretty good. We visited JRE's and got to meet the kids (they were adorable). He also gave me a new PC! I might try to set up some cheap/free fullbody tracking with it, if I can figure that out. I might also pick up Elden Ring, since it's got a good balance of my skill level and my required frustration. My friends weren't doing great for most of the week, but they're feeling a little better now. I got to rp with Telly for the first time in a while, too.
* I put my area in order. It is a wip. Twill be awesome.

!! Outside of our immediate family, who did we have significant social interactions with? 

* Uncle, Aunt, and Cousins.
* [[Root Users]], [[Rb]], [[Q]], [[Bn]], Marty, Marty's Renter, [[The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum]]
* G~~r~~eek Group
** r Group? Weird.
* Telly, Alfred, Asa, Astrophel
* A kind lady who seems to like to be mysterious.

!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family (including ourselves)?

* 1uxb0x
** I do good with kids, apparently.
*** You were empathetic, sir.
** You were great about spending some time with the boys and helping Rb outside with them.
** Although I'm sad you didn't get to stay with JRE and Rb and the boys longer, I do think you did a great job of thinking through the possibilities and making a wise decision.
** I appreciate that you hear me out in a thoughtful and kind manner, even when it's painful, boring, redundant, or seemingly pointless. Thank you.
** thank you for doing your best to be efficient when we work together.
** you are kind beyond what is required. You frequently do more than you have to. Thank you. 
* j3d1h
** when i do take notes, i think they're very concise and useful.
** Thank you for getting me a little guide book for torrenting
** I'm really glad you liked Canticle - and I enjoyed the conversations during the story about what was happening. I liked, too, with the shows we watched, how you were able to point out and analyze the tropes. You're very good at literary interpretation!
** It is both my honor and my pleasure to engage in [[philosophical analysis]] with you. You're a damned fine [[wrestling]] partner. You helped me clarify some unfun places in socializing, more than you know. Thank you.
** You have a good eye for bad jokes! Please keep it up, it makes the world a little better! 
* k0sh3k
** I did a good job this time of treating my vacation as a vacation and ignoring work.
*** Though, I think it's also wonderful that you maintained your commitment with your Greek group.
**** Yeah, but that's fun. :)
** Thank you for pushing us to go outside with the kids.
** Thank you for driving so much and for making it easy on all of us on the ride. It went smoothly despite all the hiccups. 
** you picked dang good food for your party.
** I am glad that you are home. The house seemed sad without you. 
* h0p3
** I did a fine job navigating a number of social difficulties this week, imho.
** Thank you for pushing me to hang out with JRE.
** Thank you for arranging a very chill vacation for us! And also for helping me find all the bits for cheezecayke, cheesecake, and mini-cupcakes. :) It was a very special fun day!
** thank you (and k0sh3k) for allowing us to pick up treats on the trip. it makes the whole thing more bearable :]
** you bring the oxygen back into a room.
** Thank you for chatting with me while you were gone. It kept me (relatively) sane. 
* ASK
** Thank you for taking care of the cats and the plants while we were away - and for sending updates on how they were doing!
** I missed you :P
** I missed you too. It was a very long week without you. Thank you for walking with me and chatting with me. Though no substitute, I needed the connection. I love you.
** The downstairs is looking amazing. Your hardwork is paying off.
** You did a good job self-regulating and maintaining contact. It was a successful week.
** i love talking communism with you.
** You survived a week somewhat alone. You didn't do too badly, mostly. sort of. Okay, ya fucked up kiddo, but good save.
