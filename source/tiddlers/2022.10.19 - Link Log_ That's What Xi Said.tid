*** All over the Tiktoks too. ASML customer support gone, American employees stopped working instead of losing their citizenship by executive decree, and right before Xi's coronation too: the Chinese semiconductor industry is perhaps being torpedoed during a global economic crisis in a way that can't be rebuilt in any competitive fashion. Will this spell the destruction of TSMC (and Taiwan) to make sure no one else can have it either? Even the EE folks in embedded are still struggling to find older, larger chips.

*** Despite this turning point, and even given an obsession with autarky, it still seems so costly for them to actually go to war. I'm not convinced Xi is that desperate, yet (despite over 900 Final Warnings to save face about). These moves against them are a big deal though. It may be 10 years before we see a huge shift in working age people retiring, where another known tipping point clock seems to be ticking. Further, US chip manufacturing decoupling might possibly occur in that timeframe too, which is too late. Conversely, it appears that the US is losing allies as fast as China is gaining them. 
**** Make no mistake: even if China became a model democratic nation that also acquiesced to all of the USMIC's demands overnight, it would still be treated as an enemy (like the post-USSR).

*** Another recent ugly attempt to defund helping the poor, sweep under the rug the reasons for higher rates of child neglect cases so nobody stumbles across a link to widespread poverty and threadbare social services.
