title: 2022.03.24 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Beautiful Blur

Woke at 3. Great sleep. Insane eschatological dreams. [[TTTOTW]]. 

A wild [[MeKLiN]] appears...

My sympticon awoke. //Skintime// + //Jackass Forever// skipped through dumb shit (most of the movie). [[TTTOTW]].

She's up. Hugs'n'bugs. Gloomy open. Not a morning person, never will be. My farts did not cheer her up either (I don't understand). [[TTTOTW]]. Went to see her before she left. It appears Judaic polytheism pre-second temple (in which the culture was heavily redefined) with Yahweh at the top of the heap is a non-trivial theory, particularly given the archeological evidence. [[TTTOTW]].

Shopping @ Aldi with my sympaticon. Divide and conquer. Long lashes on cashier to beat us down. The backseat of the beast is all clean and shit. Made it extra pleasant. Thank you.

Delivered the goods home.

Shopping @ W-Entity with my sympaticon. Planning for the next decade. Small things to round us out. We ran out of hand soap.

5 people lacking [[k0sh3k]] in the kitchen arguing about religion and moar. Such losers. Much winners.

Dialectics with [[5c0ut]]. Made a real budget. Gonna be doing 1-on-1s every two weeks for accountability and planning. An hour later, someone landed an executive chef position, `/high-5`.

The 5 came down to [[The Den]]. [[ASK]] napped, [[j3d1h]] made and surfed [[art]], The Men (as it were) played [[Diablo II]], like men do (only achieved 40% gayness, according to my calculations). I look hawt on that sorc. Firemage gear for [[5c0ut]]. [[1uxb0x]] and I smashed A5 and NM den. Full respec for [[1uxb0x]], and he seemed to understand it quickly.<<ref "i">> He can tank now. I should probably start planning as well.

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. Talked about our days. She is now running a pilot for student reserves that will be presented to the high council in a couple years? Difficult time concentrating today. //Inform the Men!// Meditation.

//Skintime// with my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]]. 

//The Walk// with my sympaticon, just the U. Cold and wet AF. We carried about 8 small dead tree trunks back for the [[garden]] and to start our firewood pile. Also, we got a rock that is like so fucking unique and special and rare and that's why it's valuable and [[beautiful]] and, like, amazing. It does represent a lot to me though, [[ITS]]. Thinking about the shed, compost bin, a nook for sleeping, and an inspection of that tree (we could down it ourselves, and the maple only has maybe 20 years).

We're planning a trip to a very famous library recommended to us years ago this weekend. I am glad I will have music to survive the trip. Last time, [[JRE]] called me up in the middle of the art museum. Maybe I'll get [[lucky]] again. =).

[[Family Gathering]] was dope. People talked. I listened. Pizza leftovers, water, and butter cookies. Drug dealer episode of //House//. [[TTTOTW]].

Put mi amor to bed. Put my sympaticon to couch + //Community//. Sleep by 9:30?
