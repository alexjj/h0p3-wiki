title: 2020.12.18 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: ü§´

* Read+Write
* Luhsahgnuh + water
* Fireman Time!
* Sleep by 6:30
* Woke at 12:30
** Rough dreams again. Just ruminated. My curl-up is expensive.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* [[MTG]], Daughter's Affinity vs. Infect +1, an excellent match. Mamba regen pressures on her double MoE board as she double clamped her way (too slowly, but she started getting there) to land an alpha-strike we were both hunting for. Lots of rules questions and combat math. It's not our usual. The more interesting part of the game was how defensive both players had to be.
** Hard to go +2-3 simply because there are too many hands that just win without interaction in that space.
* Pingpong, in which we managed to get worse overnight
* Prepared dinner
* The Attic
** My arms are sore from all the hammering. There were a lot of nails from the roofers that would impale anyone who fell or ran into the wall (which does happen in pingpong). We made it safe. Needed young eyes to spot 'em. 
** Measured out the areas of the floor that lack actual flooring. Gonna try to find a cheap option. 
** Measured out insulation. Planning a secret (shhhh, ü§´). 
*** I am disappointed in my offspring's mental math skills. It's killing me. They can learn and wield abstractions and some proofs so quickly, but their arithmetic is awful. It's unbelievable. I beg them. They aint gonna listen me though. Who does? lmao.
** Everyone got a hammer and a flashlight (it's dark even with three lights) to go over the hundreds of nails on the floor, also a safety problem (and we can't sand it down as is). This place wasn't used for anything other than storage. We're going try to make it a real living space though.
* //Skintime// -> Assisted Fireman Time!
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Ribs, wedges, apples, zucchini, and a beer
** [[MTG]], Son's Vintage MUC 0, +1, +2 vs Modern Titty Burn: hard to pay attention when I have custom mountains as hawt as these. Predictable story, except he's mulling hard because of virtual card disadvantage qua board control, and eventually he squeaks by with a counter on the last piece. Wish->Whelk was strong (though it didn't alter the game beyond just countering)...good move. 
*** He needs silverbullets.
* VC with [[DeathOfRobinhood]]
** I done got booped.
** He's kicking ass at work (I'm jelly). Moved from his flourishing project (one he cultivated) to do creative director work on a new one (that's the position he's been gunnin' for). Open to going wherever fits. It's a remoteable job, so who knows where he'll end up (still, anything on the level of PBS probably can't be surpassed).
*** I don't work in his industry (which sounds like pure hell to me), so what do I know? From my perspective, he's very intentional, doubts himself too much (I appreciate his conservatism, humility, skepticism too). I understand he doesn't like some of his disorganization (though this is super common among the humanities and creatives), and he considers himself a lone freelancer (and he's definitely an introvert), but from what I can see: he's really good with people (I know he's on his way to being a virtuoso animator too, but maybe people turns out to be one of his dark horse abilities). He leads well, and he commits his ideas in his own way. I can see why he is trusted with more. 
*** Wrestling with another who has a different conception of [[The Good]]. He's got his method. It's not propaganda, confrontational, preachy, or seeking to show there is a distinct right or wrong set of perspectives in every context (permissibility and empathy and ...I'm lacking a word). You know me, ofc.
*** Thinking about how to weave local talent perspectives into the work. It's a fancy Canadian cultural work.
** Apologized. I'm more nervous than he is (which I'm glad). Everything is good. Talked about the future year, financial forecasting, the joy of talking, and a fear that I consider basically impossible (I had to hold myself back from laughing because I know it's a real feeling, and it's my honor to be his friend)...//I would {[[stake|Axioms]]} my life on it, and I know he will too.// (though I understand one does not have maximum control over feelings).
*** Selah's vocation is maybe on hold for a bit, but it will be okay. A suitable person has appeared to relieve some of the obligation.
** Autist bro is not a teenager, he's an old fart like me. 
** His friend can read my [[‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±]] do determine if he wants to initiate further. One who does not read my words to some [[dok]] probably won't care for my spoken words either.
** CV19 seems not too disruptive up there. Didn't seem too worried about economics/politics, so that's probably good.
** His mother is doing well, upswing, eating enough and speaking with folks.
*** Fek. I forgot to ask about his in-laws, dad especially.
** Interesting is a non-committal word.
** Continues to demonstrate the superiority of Canada. 
** Talked about how we're doing. I spoke too much, as usual. I need to listen more. That needs to be where I go in my conversations. I'm talking too much. 
** I think my friend is feeling pulled in many directions and somewhat doubtful. Despite the world, I think the snowball is rolling hard in his favor.
* Bugged my wife. My farts continue to damage our relationship. 
** Excited about [[AIR]] living with us. 
** I was sent away, a firm "i'm trying to read, good night, go to bed." Instant boner, [[Miss Direction]]. Defiantly, the worm popped out of the hole in my blue camo onesy (need to sew it up) for troll-style points. We don't have curtains, but I know the neighbors won't mind. This is my cultural way: they wouldn't deprive me of my retardations, would they?
