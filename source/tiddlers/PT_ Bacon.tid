; 1561-1626: Francis Bacon

* The scientific method consists of data collection, hypothesis generation, experiment confirmation, and prediction.
* Negative instances are as important as positive ones in guiding us to the right conclusions.
* Our senses, feelings, and ideologies can be obstacles in our search for reliable knowledge.
* Words are but images of matter, to fall in love with them is to fall in love with a picture.
