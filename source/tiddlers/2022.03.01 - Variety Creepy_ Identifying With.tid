title: 2022.03.01 - Variety Creepy: Identifying With

"""
[08:25:51] [[Variety Creepy]]: Hey
[08:25:59] [[Variety Creepy]]: Wanna teach your kids emotional endurance? Make them watch How I Met Your Mother.
[08:26:13] [[Variety Creepy]]: Best sitcom ever and it's amazing, and sad at the same time.
[10:20:52] [[Variety Creepy]]: Do you like Eminem's songs?
[10:21:09] [[Variety Creepy]]: I've noticed only Lose Yourself on your songs list.
[12:11:04] [[h0p3]]: Good morning, sir. I'm just gettin' up.
[12:11:25] [[h0p3]]: What makes //How I Met Your Mother// a show for learning emotional endurance?
[12:11:46] [[h0p3]]: (I think I agree. Like most shows, only the early seasons really seemed to be worthy.)
[12:12:49] [[h0p3]]: Eminem was hot shit when I was a teenager. I only paid attention to his earlier work. I've not kept up with the man. He's a genius.
[12:15:15] [[h0p3]]: I'm in great need of media recommendations, including music. So, I'm grateful that you are lookin' out for me here.
[12:16:55] [[Variety Creepy]]: The main character, Ted Mosby, always wants to find 'The One' whom he would marry. He spends years trying to find one and fails miserably all the time. He falls in love with so many different people and each one of them end badly. He breaks up with the perfect girl because they couldn't agree on the whether to have kids or not. He gets left at the alter. One of his best friend ends up dating the girl he loved. When he reaches the highest point of his career, it was also the day his friend proposes to the love of his life and he had to ensure that they end up engaged. He never finds true happiness until the end of the show, and even then, loses his wife to a disease.
[12:17:02] [[Variety Creepy]]: I feel so bad for him
[12:17:16] [[Variety Creepy]]: I hope that I haven't spoilt it for you.
[12:18:56] [[Variety Creepy]]: > [22:42:48] [[h0p3]]: Eminem was hot shit when I was a teenager. I only paid attention to his earlier work. I've not kept up with the man. He's a genius.
I always keep forgetting that you were a teen in the early 2000s. I always picture it in the 90s. How big was Eminem at that time? I know he was the world's most famous, but still, I'm curious.
[12:19:27] [[Variety Creepy]]: His earlier works are the best ones. The rest of them are good, but comparatively, nope.
[12:20:30] [[h0p3]]: I thought Ted was an evil moron, as with everyone else on the show. I think it was capitalism's attempt to soothe and entertain masses who had no interest in even learning about (let alone experiencing) real intimacy or commitment.
[12:20:50] [[h0p3]]: Definitely a "what not to do" kind of show. 
[12:21:28] [[h0p3]]: You haven't spoiled it. I've seen the show.
[12:22:33] [[Variety Creepy]]: Nahm dude. There is a lot of things opposite to capitalism, like when Marshall becomes an environmental lawyer. He gives up a well paying job for saving the planet.
[12:22:52] [[Variety Creepy]]: Ted definitely wasn't evil. 
[12:23:07] [[h0p3]]: Well, I can appreciate that most don't feel that way.
[12:23:24] [[Variety Creepy]]: Barney was kind of evil, but nah, he wasn't that bad.
[12:23:44] [[Variety Creepy]]: > Well, I can appreciate that most don't feel that way.
Well, they are entitled to their opinions.
[12:23:54] [[h0p3]]: Another difficult topic. =)
[12:24:18] [[Variety Creepy]]: It's just that I can relate a lot to Ted.
[12:24:23] [[h0p3]]: I'm fortunate to be able to watch shows multiple times over the decades. It provides key perspective.
[12:24:40] [[h0p3]]: We are all meant to fit his greyness, the everyman. 
[12:25:56] [[h0p3]]: Eminem was huge. All over MTV (a dying channel), friends blasting him in their cars (very cool, ofc). Not everyone cared for the genre, but he even made in-roads with that crowd too. Instant legend. Who couldn't appreciate that narcissistic attitude?
[12:27:00] [[Variety Creepy]]: He wants to find The One. I want to find The One. He's a hopeless romantic. I'm a hopeless romantic. He goes out of his way for his friends. I would do the same. He never finds true happiness, I never find true happiness. 
[12:28:41] [[h0p3]]: It's important to engage in the practice of [[Identifying With: Fictional Characters]].
[12:29:33] [[h0p3]]: I've found it to be an expensive process.
[12:29:41] [[Variety Creepy]]: We no longer get to see acting like a dick making someone popular anymore. It's sad :(
His music is pretty good. He's still the best selling artist of the 21st century.
[12:30:30] [[h0p3]]: I think lots of people get popular acting like a dick. Kanye is a great example in the same vein, but there are many arts to consider.
[12:36:03] [[Variety Creepy]]: But most of them are shortlived
[12:36:34] [[h0p3]]: Fame & Fortune, it does appear to be the primary motivation of so many figures.
[12:37:29] [[Variety Creepy]]: Yeah.. I want a fortune, but not fame. 
[12:37:56] [[Variety Creepy]]: Also, that's a really long list of characters whom you identify with.
[12:38:07] [[h0p3]]: Tried to keep it as short as I could.
[12:38:20] [[h0p3]]: =D
[12:38:30] [[h0p3]]: What will you do with your fortune?
[12:38:34] [[Variety Creepy]]: üòÇüòÇ
[12:38:40] [[h0p3]]: Will it be in virtue of the pursuit of the aesthetic?
[12:43:33] [[Variety Creepy]]: Having money would be nice. I had a shitty childhood because I got robbed out of many inheritances. It ruined my childhood. I just want a fortune of my own money, big enough that my future children would not have to go through the same troubles I went through. Even though we're a lot better now, I'm still scared about money, being low on cash, etc. I carry 2 wallets, each with sufficient money for me to back home 20 times from college, just so that if I were ever in need, I wouldn't have to ask anyone. 
[12:44:43] [[h0p3]]: I know that feeling.
[12:45:11] [[h0p3]]: I'm surprised to hear that lack of inheritance ruined your childhood.
[12:45:41] [[h0p3]]: Most people who don't feel they earned their money (though they are generally wrong about this as well) don't feel nearly as happy with it. 
[12:46:00] [[h0p3]]: There's something to be said for having made your own way, though, ofc, we all need help.
[12:46:24] [[h0p3]]: That being scared of lacking material can echo, even through our genes.
[12:47:44] [[Variety Creepy]]: If I weren't robbed of any inheritances, my parents' net worth would probably have been more than 1 billion rupees, which is kinda like 15 million dollars.
[12:48:09] [[h0p3]]: Instead, it is 1/15th of that sum, right? Still seems like quite an inheritance. 
[12:49:19] [[Variety Creepy]]: That's not inheritance. That is what my parents have made from the scratch. 
[12:49:28] [[Variety Creepy]]: We got zero inheritance.
[12:49:48] [[Variety Creepy]]: And I honestly don't care about the money.
[12:49:49] [[h0p3]]: From scratch, lawd. That is impressive.
[12:50:02] [[h0p3]]: Oh, what will you do with your fortune?
[12:51:06] [[Variety Creepy]]: It's more about the emotional scarring, the arguments happening in the house, cutting off contact with family members, etc.
[12:51:16] [[h0p3]]: Aye. That is awful.
[12:51:32] [[h0p3]]: Where we learn what we mean to each other.
[12:53:39] [[Variety Creepy]]: If I make a fortune, I would make trust funds for the kids (only accessible if I die before they become adults). Buy a nice house, a moderately expensive car like a BMW or something. Invest the rest.
[12:54:10] [[h0p3]]: Dreams
[12:54:17] [[Variety Creepy]]: Yeah...
[12:55:32] [[Variety Creepy]]: What would you do if you made a fortune?
[12:57:29] [[h0p3]]: A question for the ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±. =)
[12:57:41] [[h0p3]]: [[Prompted Introspection]] covers it well enough.
[12:57:52] [[Variety Creepy]]: Alright, I will look into it.
[13:01:14] [[Variety Creepy]]: Before you get the wrong idea or misunderstand, I just think of fortune as happy childhood because when I look back at it, that's what I'm reminded of. My parents bickering all the time because of what happened (especially as it happened from both sides of the family). It's not about money for me. I'm almost certain that if my parents had argued behind closed doors or after we were asleep, I would have had a different answer.
[13:01:54] [[h0p3]]: That is not clear to me. I appreciate that you mean something else by fortune though!
[13:02:35] [[h0p3]]: If your parental units are dark-triadic, I would bet that if the inheritance and bickering about it weren't the problem, something else would have been.
[13:03:20] [[h0p3]]: Happy childhood is a complicated matter. I suggest that flourishing is a very rich concept that isn't reducible to pleasure.
[13:04:04] [[h0p3]]: I agree that having good parents (and even community) is crucial for flourishing as a child.
[13:05:05] [[Variety Creepy]]: Well, I know that due to genetics and seeing my parents argue, I'm highly likely to end up like them. I've heard a lot of, "You argue like your dad!", "You are very much like your mum" already. I can see their traits in me. I don't want to end up like them, so I'm trying to remove all the root causes of arguments and stuff like that.
[13:05:28] [[Variety Creepy]]: I know it's a futile effort, but at least, it's something.
[13:05:41] [[h0p3]]: That's an expensive thing to hear from one's parental units. 
[13:05:54] [[h0p3]]: They may not have been honest or sufficiently careful with their words. 
[13:06:08] [[h0p3]]: I think you often argue quite well.
[13:06:37] [[h0p3]]: And, I respect how you work to break the cycle.
[13:06:43] [[h0p3]]: That is so hard to do. 
[13:07:10] [[h0p3]]: It is fortunate that you are not your parents and that you still have time and material to shape yourself.
[13:07:43] [[Variety Creepy]]: Yes, I do argue. I also want peace of mind, so I try to make sure that I argue as less as possible. 
[13:07:58] [[Variety Creepy]]: It really is hard work.
[13:08:02] [[h0p3]]: It is not clear to me that peace of mind is achieved that way. 
[13:08:29] [[Variety Creepy]]: We can't, but at least a quiet house helps.
[13:08:57] [[Variety Creepy]]: I want to change the topic. I don't feel comfortable talking about it. Is that fine>
[13:08:59] [[Variety Creepy]]: ?*
[13:09:34] [[h0p3]]: That's fine. 
[13:10:38] [[Variety Creepy]]: I'm sitting here in my room and I can hear prayers and devotional songs being sung one kilometer away
[13:10:44] [[h0p3]]: Wow
[13:10:49] [[Variety Creepy]]: It's happening in a temple.
[13:10:49] [[h0p3]]: Is it good?
[13:11:01] [[h0p3]]: Send me a clip of it, if you can.
[13:11:19] [[h0p3]]: I'll trade you a picture of my battlestation.
[13:11:21] [[Variety Creepy]]: It's faint, so I would my laptop would detect it.
[13:11:34] [[Variety Creepy]]: doubt*
[13:12:11] [[Variety Creepy]]: A passing car is more audible than that.
[13:13:21] [[Variety Creepy]]: It's not good for me. I'm not a religious guy. That song was probably written like 100 years ago or is probably a poem written by saints centuries ago
[13:13:43] [[h0p3]]: Oh, well, maybe some headphones or speakers will help.
[13:13:49] [[Variety Creepy]]: My own mother tongue has evolved so much that I don't understand a word from it.
[13:13:54] [[h0p3]]: Fascinating.
[13:14:13] [[Variety Creepy]]: How can headphones and speakers help?
[13:14:28] [[h0p3]]: So you can listen to something else, perhaps.
[13:14:33] [[h0p3]]: Drown it out.
[13:15:16] [[Variety Creepy]]: Oh... yeah, I could do it, but nah. This will go on all night. Better get used to it now or else I'd have to suffer when I sleep.
[13:15:36] [[h0p3]]: How has your holiday been?
[13:17:55] [[Variety Creepy]]: It is supposed to be a day of fasting(today), stay up all night singing prayers to God and then eat tomorrow. But in my family, we don't do that much. We eat non-rice food(as rice is our staple food, we don't eat it), don't stay up all night. Eat nice food tomorrow.
[13:18:20] [[h0p3]]: `/nod`
[13:19:39] [[Variety Creepy]]: Apparently, all those people gathered at the temples also sing and dance and do stuff like that. There are also many religious heads who do concert-like shows in their ashrams.
[13:22:47] [[Variety Creepy]]: Some people even smoke pot for the God celebrated today. 
[13:22:57] [[h0p3]]: Dope =)
[13:23:02] [[Variety Creepy]]: It's rare and is banned by the government.
[13:23:07] [[h0p3]]: That is unfortunate
[13:23:49] [[Variety Creepy]]: I don't share your feeling on this matter.
[13:24:00] [[h0p3]]: I didn't at your age either.
[13:24:13] [[Variety Creepy]]: Cool
[13:24:31] [[Variety Creepy]]: A lot of people are on the roads today
[13:24:45] [[h0p3]]: I bet it's super busy.
[13:24:51] [[h0p3]]: I'm not one who enjoys driving in the city.
[13:26:28] [[Variety Creepy]]: Near temples, yes. I live in a residential area and I can hear 2-5 vehicles going in front of my house every minute.
[13:26:45] [[h0p3]]: That's pretty decent.
[13:26:52] [[Variety Creepy]]: This definitely isn't a good day for driving.
[13:33:33] [[Variety Creepy]]: My previous house was near two mosques. If you already did not know, they pray 5 times a day and at each time, a person goes on top of the minarets with a speaker and call for Allah. It's in Arabic, so I don't understand what they actually say. The first prayer is at 4:30 am. It's nice to wake up to the sounds of prayers being made, whatever the religion it may be.
[13:34:05] [[h0p3]]: Can fill one with a sense of awe. 
[13:36:54] [[Variety Creepy]]: Yeah, sometimes I would have already woken up and would be showering. It's nice.
[13:39:46] [[Variety Creepy]]: Summer is gonna start in a couple of weeks
[13:40:04] [[Variety Creepy]]: The weather has already warmed up a lot.
[13:40:12] [[Variety Creepy]]: How are things in New Jersey?
[13:40:17] [[h0p3]]: What's a comfortable temperature range for you?
[13:40:58] [[h0p3]]: Connecticut is still pretty cold. Like -1C atm.
[13:41:04] [[h0p3]]: Snow everywhere. 
[13:41:17] [[Variety Creepy]]: I feel really cold below 15 degrees Celsius and hot if it is above 30 degrees Celsius.
[13:41:33] [[Variety Creepy]]: Whoa... It's snowing even in March? Wow.
[13:42:10] [[Variety Creepy]]: Bangalore was 17 degrees last night and 32 in the morning
[13:42:16] [[h0p3]]: got damn
[13:42:33] [[Variety Creepy]]: It's 21 degrees right now.
[13:42:43] [[h0p3]]: That's an excellent temp.
[13:43:38] [[Variety Creepy]]: Haha, I would trade anything for Bangalore's weather whenever I'm outside the city!
[13:48:48] [[Variety Creepy]]: Okay, it's nearly 20 minutes past midnight. I'm off to bed. Have a great day!
[13:49:01] [[h0p3]]: Sleep well, sir.
