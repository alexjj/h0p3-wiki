*** Not a fan of its fans, but that is often the case for this tooling.
*** [[Outopos]] attempt. I'm excited. 
*** Cannot speak to their b-word. Whole experience is gamified. Slick as snot. Yeah, it does feel like a sketch honeypot riced into oblivion. That might just be un[[grateful]]ness and cynicism.
*** At the very least, I appreciate the art. 
**** Fonts aint right, and I'm not taking this out of VM. Aint FOSS, so you don't get my upvote.
**** Someone poured blood, sweat, and tears into this one though. 
*** It claims to solve what I consider to be a lot of the primary problems up front. DNS and Zawinskis included. If they can make a sick F2F moderation model, Hypercore, and FOSS it within 2 years, that'd be nice.

*** Message left. `/wave`
