In the US, selective judicial review serves to fill the evolving gaps in precedent that fail to uphold the interests of the wealthy.

Eliminate false [[hope]] and unjustified [[bias]] by choosing to be optimistic about fighting for the best possible future through wise resentment and cynicism, especially of oneself.

Beware passkey schemes that are beholden to proprietary client-side software to correctly identify site origins passed onto the physical authenticator. We may become further locked into vendors, browsers, and OSes that prevent authorized identity migration. In practice, passwordless authentication mechanisms are a trojan horse, giving more ground to oligopolies that own our identities and create more friction in switching ecosystems. Keychain automation (even simply via one's phone) owned and controlled by big players is only playing with fire. 2FA that prevents user-controlled hardware and software is DOA. Who owns the means of production?

Set aside boiling oceans and the plateaus of personal computing, given both the growing ambiguity between RAM and persistent storage, as well as the necessity of securing distributed zetta computing (and the possible necessity of hyperconverged [[shared]] programming for [[Outopos]] and [[TOP]], where every computer's RAM might be any computer's RAM) because of other limits we've hit, 128-bit pointers with a memory-tagging tuple of (address, bounds, permissions), where every pointer is bounds-checked, seems worthy. UUIDs as well as multiple pointers in ZFS and IPv6 may also point toward 128-bit pointers. Perhaps even 256-bit computing isn't absolutely out of the question if security and metadata are fundamental, but I have no idea what this departure from current architectures and political agreements would entail. Justified_nation_state_actor+ FLOSS RISC {[[Dream]]}s, yo.

Why, but, of course, let the current prisoners fight in the war, and imprison the deserters. Rotate who counts as a criminal.
