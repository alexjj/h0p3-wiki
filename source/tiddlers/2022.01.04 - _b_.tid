I'm a computer user in the sense that I'm an addict. finna re-up.

<br>

I learn stupid amounts about [[computing]] by just picking up software and playing with it like an idiot. Something to be said for the method of the retard.

<br>

I am tired of explaining how things will go wrong to those I predict aren't going to be motivated by the truth.

<br>

Perhaps one of the interesting game-theoretic concerns of [[anonymous]] giving of our materials, including our models, [[PSM]]ing in particular, is that essentialist, dogmatic enforcement of "not [[PSM]]ing what is not worth [[PSM]]ing" at least tends to force compromises of the selfish. The World is a classroom, and all participants have obligations to participate wisely in classrooms. Unfortunately, even [[silence]] can be clearly defective.

I have a hard time taking feminists seriously who don't acknowledge how much a role females play in defining or shaping masculinity, let alone identifying that the fundamental [[power]] imbalance is driven by a more secular, psychopathic problem: using others as mere means. If you can't reach the CI as your inflection point with me in discussions of normativity, then I'm going to call you a fraud; that's unjustifiably [[toxic]] feminism^^tm^^. I find most just as confused as most Christians and most any other movement. As usual, I'm [[grateful]] and [[lucky]] to encounter exceptions who have prioritized in[[justice]] [[irwartfrr]].
