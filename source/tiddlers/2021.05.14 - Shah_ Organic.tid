May 14 2:50pm
How about you?
May 14 2:50pm
Im going to finish staining the patio like the parts that need two coat. Floors getting redone so can't fully paint the patio due to the construction people having to use it to get to the kitchen.
May 14 3:07pm
Ohhh, neat.

Your family's house is gorgeous, btw.

May 14 3:09pm
How do you know
May 14 3:09pm
You showed me pictures of the puppers.
May 14 3:09pm
I assumed that was your house.
May 14 3:09pm
Perhaps that wasn't a wise assumption.
May 14 3:09pm

May 14 3:11pm
She seems like a very busy woman.
May 14 3:11pm
Idk how to feel. She is also taking the puppers.
May 14 3:11pm
Change can be expensive. Nice to have a place to live though.
May 14 3:12pm
Eh who she is with is taking care of her. Shes not working as much anymore cuz of college. She cant do college and work.
May 14 3:12pm

May 14 3:12pm
Wait hold are you actually a stalker type
May 14 3:21pm
I definitely look into who people are. They are always free to leave me, and I leave them alone.

(that link will have to be CnPed)
May 14 3:23pm
Huh. So i assumed you looked into who I am already.
May 14 3:23pm
Don't know how thats possible.
May 14 3:23pm
I haven't, actually.
May 14 3:23pm
I'm letting our relationship grow organically.
May 14 3:24pm
Oh nice!
May 14 3:24pm
I'm trying to give you the chance to see who I am without the usual pressure that I apply to people.
May 14 3:24pm
I am putting my skin all the way in the game with you though.
May 14 3:24pm
I speak with a very wide variety of people.
May 14 3:25pm
Dont know what that terminology means in this case.
May 14 3:28pm
sk away, and I'll answer as best I can.
May 14 3:28pm
Sometimes I pack a lot into a single word. I know that can be painful.
May 14 3:29pm
What do you mean by putting my skin all the way in the game
May 14 3:29pm
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_in_the_game_(phrase)
May 14 3:29pm
I mean to tell you that I make myself quite vulnerable to you, asymmetrically even. You can know me without me knowing you.
May 14 3:30pm
Imagine you had a bookshelf of highly interlinked and structured diaries of your thoughts and feelings. I'm handing mine to you up front.
May 14 3:31pm
I aim to make it easy to build Intimacy (https://philosopher.life/#Fostering%20Intimacy) with me.
May 14 3:32pm
Oh! Nice. Well ima start off by letting you know I partake in the marijuana activties but im planning to quit this year.
May 14 3:33pm
It comes and goes for me. I'm a fan, of course.
May 14 3:33pm
It can be a demotivating substance, lowers IQ (temporarily) by 5 points, and can exacerbate underlying schizo-affective disorders (runs in my family).

May 14 3:34pm
My IQ is terrible.
May 14 3:34pm
I be alright.
May 14 3:34pm
Why are you quittin?
May 14 3:34pm
Money and just dont want to be smoking it as much as i do now. I depend on it to feel alright.
May 14 3:35pm
I shouldnt be dependent on a substance for my emotions
May 14 3:35pm
Dependency != Addiction, but I admire your desire.
May 14 3:36pm
I know how difficult it is to be price-efficient with consumption.
May 14 3:36pm
Eh, i know a guy who gives it to me cheaper cuz im a regular. And his stuff actually gets me high. So ive sticked with him since. I have another guy but his isnt great..its lower than my guy but cuz his shjt isnt as good.
May 14 3:37pm
My mother gifted me dispensary weed, i have yet to try that.
May 14 3:37pm
Two cheapest options are making your own edibles (about a dollar a hit): https://philosopher.life/#Recipe%3A%20Cannabutter
May 14 3:38pm
And not using cannabis directly, but instead Delta-8 distillate: https://philosopher.life/#Product%20Review%3A%20%CE%94%E2%81%B8
May 14 3:39pm
I use low doses though.
May 14 3:39pm
Convection vaporizers are reasonable enough, but still not in the same league.
May 14 3:40pm
Oh my god i can make cannabis butter...my mom will be gone in july
May 14 3:40pm
HAHA!!!
May 14 3:40pm
Party hard! =)

May 14 3:41pm
Edibles dont really hit me unless its homemade.
May 14 3:41pm
Know someones mom who makes lovely edible brownies.. took one before work before, NEVER AGAIN. I underestimated the potency.
May 14 3:42pm
Luckily i was training someone that day, so my job was easy.
