title: 2022.12.08 - yvyfyf: AIssisted Schizogibberish Interrogations

//Qua [[2022.11.30 - yvyfyf: Explanation]]; text-davinci-003, .7, 1000, 1, 2, 2, 1; eliminating lines from the bottom-up (left as an exercise to the reader, ofc), this is what our third interlocutor happened to predict (I was [[grateful]] to see that it had plenty of arguments to provide on my side). May it serve as an intuition pump for you. I'm looking forward to your positive arguments where you put your own skin in the game.//

* I think it's a matter of complexity. The more complex something is, the harder it becomes to precisely represent and predict its behavior with finite computing power. We may be able to approximate a Theory of Everything (ToE) but achieving exact precision would require infinite computation because we can't possibly conceive all possible states that could exist in reality without having some kind of complete understanding about how everything works on an infinitely small scale.
* The concept of a Theory of Everything would include the understanding and incorporation of all conceivable physical laws, forces, interactions etc. It is likely that even if we could devise equations to describe those things it may not be possible for us (or any finite being) to calculate the results in every case due to their complexity. Therefore I think an infinite computation power might be required in order for such a theory or model to exist as anything less than approximate or incomplete.
* I mean that it is not only physical objects which must be taken into account, but all of the abstract concepts and ideas as well. A theory of everything would need to encompass every possible idea or concept in order for it to truly explain "everything". This requires an infinite amount of computation because there are potentially an infinite number of possibilities which could exist within a single system.
* In order to truly understand all concepts, we would need infinite computation. This is because our ability to comprehend and explain a concept relies on the context in which it exists. With an infinite amount of data points available for analysis, we could theoretically develop a comprehensive understanding of any given concept or idea that existed within this vast system. In other words, when attempting to formulating a theory of everything you must include not only the physical laws but also their associated ideas as well; thus requiring an infinitely large dataset from which knowledge can be derived accurately and completely without limitation or bias.
** In order to accurately describe a concept, we would need an infinite amount of computation in order to fully explore all the possible aspects and implications. This is different than merely applying physical laws since it involves understanding how those same concepts interact with each other within various contexts.
** To answer your question, I think a theory of everything requires infinite computation because it would need to encompass all concepts and phenomena in the universe. This includes not only physical objects such as planets or atoms, but also abstract ideas such as morality and beauty. These things are much more difficult to quantify than simple equations like F=ma since they involve subjective interpretation that varies from person-to-person which makes them hard (if not impossible) to accurately represent with mathematics alone.
* Because of the infinitely complex relationships between concepts and their various implications. It requires a consideration of all possible scenarios, which is impossible to achieve without infinite computation.
** I think it would require an infinite number of computations to understand the entire concept, as there are an infinite amount of interpretations and angles from which one could approach a single concept.
** I think it is because trying to measure and quantify every concept would require infinite computation. We can try, but ultimately we will have limits in our understanding of the complexity that exists within all concepts.
** I think it requires an understanding of the infinite possibilities that could exist in any given concept. To truly understand something, we must be able to comprehend all variations and permutations within our own minds. This necessitates a deep level of analysis which can only come from having access to countless iterations or calculations before arriving at a conclusion about what is true for each particular case.
* No, I don't think it does. f = ma is a mathematical equation that describes the behavior of physical objects without necessarily describing every single one. A theory of all concepts would require more than just mathematics and equations to explain them in detail; there needs to be some kind of understanding or explanation for why those concepts are as they are.
** The equation f = ma does not need to include all physical objects, but a theory of everything would have to account for them. I think it could be possible that some concepts are more fundamental than others and can explain the rest without necessarily listing out every single concept in exhaustive detail.
**  No, the equation f = ma does not need to include a list of all physical objects because it's an abstract expression of some fundamental relationship between forces and acceleration. A theory of everything would likely be more complex than that since it needs to account for concepts which can't necessarily be boiled down into such simple equations.
** No, it doesn't necessarily mean the equation is incomplete; there could be something else that needs to be accounted for. However, a theory of all concepts would need to include an explanation and description of each concept in order to truly capture its full scope.
* Because there may be some concepts that defy universal explanation.
** Complexity, context dependence and incompleteness of certain elements may limit the applicability.
** Well, some concepts may be too complex or obscure for a general statement to accurately describe them.
*** I think some concepts may be too complex to fit into a general formulation. They would need their own individual explanations and definitions, which could require infinite computation in order to accurately describe them all.
* I'm undecided, yes. But I think that a theory of everything could be formulated without infinite computation if we can agree on what counts as "everything".
* The objection is that there are certain concepts, such as Dialetheia (i.e., true contradictions), where it may be impossible to make a statement which holds for all cases and doesn't require infinite computation.
* The Dialetheia is a concept which suggests that there are certain paradoxical statements that can be true and false at the same time. This could complicate matters when attempting to formulate such a theory, as it would require us to account for these seemingly paradoxical statements.
** The Dialetheia is the idea that some propositions can be both true and false at the same time. This suggests that a theory of all concepts might have to deal with paradoxical statements, which may require an infinite amount of computation in order to resolve.
** The Dialetheia is a problem that suggests some statements may be both true and false, meaning they are impossible to fully describe in any one theory. This could pose an obstacle for creating a comprehensive statement about all concepts which would not require infinite computation.
** Dialetheia is the philosophical idea that some statements can be both true and false at the same time. It's a hard problem because it means we cannot use conventional logic to make sense of reality, as there are truths which don't fit into our logical system.
** Dialetheia is the idea that certain statements can be both true and false at once. It's a difficult problem to solve, as it requires us to think in terms of two contradicting truths existing simultaneously â€“ something which goes against our intuition about reality.
