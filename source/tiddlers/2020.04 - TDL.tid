* She has taken the deal, and I can feel it even in here. =(
** Thank god I can get myself off better than ever.
*** I think my brother [[JRE]] is correct on this matter. 
* I've not done a great job on [[Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση]].
** Our presentations have been excellent though. Raw seminar.
* I'm grateful that we had brats. 
** Planning a risk. Was delicious, and now we have evidence.
* [[title.Title]] maymays are [[/b/]]ish.
* We're all trying to mount the horse together.
* I can tell that [[TTP]]s continue to overtake some of the duties here. 
** It's still {[[dream]]}-work in here. I'm really bad at this work. Welp. Gotta fuckin' try. Gotta learn how to do it well enough that my offspring have something worth mimicking too.
