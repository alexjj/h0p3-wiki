title: 2020.09.27 - Prompted Introspection: Make A Joyful Noise

!! Write about a souvenir you have bought or received.

I have a clear favorite. The best [[ocarina|2018.01.20 - Prompted Introspection Log: Musical Instruments]]. I bought this mug (technical term for me at the time) at a Grand Canyon souvenir shop. It was not a half-assed instrument compared to most trinkets, and it was gorgeous. It sounded really good too. I wish I didn't lose that blasted thing. Why did I get it? At the time, there was an important game in our household that had something to do with an Ocarina. I'm pretty sure this Zelda kid was trying to rescue a princess for the sake of his boneflute. I don't remember much about the game (not my thing). However, I like noise-makers.
