title: 2020.12.24 - Prompted Introspection: Drink It In

!! If you were invited to an all-nude party, where all the participants are required to be naked the whole time, would you go?

It depends (surprise!). Who is going to be at the party and why? I'm not the sort of person who goes to parties, and most people aren't the sort who would want me at their party either.<<ref "w">> I don't really belong, and I'd be more curious by having been invited to a party I wanted to attend regardless of nudity (that would be something extra special). I think my favorite parties are small gatherings of mi familia. Let's be real, including my family: nobody wants to see my tiny penis, my moobs, my back titties, my fur, my insanely long pubic hair, let alone my ugly face.<<ref "t">> My [[naked]]ness serves many purposes, but it's not the delicious sort generally (well, not delicious for anyone but me, lmao). At best, in terms of pleasant sociability, I am a source of comedic relief. 

All else being equal, if I didn't hate the people there (difficult, I realize) and there were attractive females, I'd go. Shamelessly drink it in.
