[14:28:11] h0p3: I appreciate that. Thank you.
[14:28:17] h0p3: Hard to fit my requirements.
[14:28:17] Galaxian: it's free if you stream from your computer
[14:28:38] Galaxian: if you use servers, not sure of the price, but it cost
[14:29:25] h0p3: I'm looking for a webtorrent (over webRTC) option that cleanly embeds into my ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±.
[14:29:38] Galaxian: you can use other softwares, but it's harder to set it up and i don't know how to do
[14:29:45] h0p3: https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent
[14:32:14] Galaxian: interesting

[03:46:05] Galaxian: i don't go out a lot either
[03:46:16] h0p3: We neurodiverse folks.
[03:46:27] h0p3: I would argue I am generally sociall defeated. =D.
