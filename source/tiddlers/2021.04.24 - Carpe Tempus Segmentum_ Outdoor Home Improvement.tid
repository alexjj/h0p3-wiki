Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]] Tuna and //The Eric Andre Show// (I don't know why, but the puke on the show isn't a problem for eating). 

Took a nap. [[Shah]] woke me up from Signal. Chatter. [[TTTOTW]]. Did I just make a friend? Cool. I wasn't sure that was possible anymore. `/squint`. I couldn't be arsed to drive to NY, but maybe I should. There are plenty of geeks to meet (though who would have the time for us?). Unless they decide to take up my advice of hacking their way (as only minors could) into that one universityplacemabobthatweliveherefor(cmonloserswtf?), I suppose it wouldn't hurt to at least have some folks to sling cards with. Meh. I aint pushin hard. I'm an insane person who lives in his basement. Let's keep it that way.

//Skintime//. Woke offspring. We all made breakfast together. We had fun in the kitchen. Softboiled eggs, mandarins, bagel, and coffee. Offspring and I drafted the entire cube, and then as an additional experiment, we tried trading again. My son was much more into it than my daughter. My wife ran her bookclub, then she had an impromptu extended family gathering on FB (I die inside every time: c'mon people!).

[[TTTOTW]]. Assignments. 

She came to get me. My bed. //Skintime// and there was too much humor for a long time. I'm a good clown. Eventually, however, we became serious, as one must. Literally Inform the Men! She's making it up to me. An entire week: I almost died. Literally. Like, you totally have no idea. Meditation. Shower of the gods!

[[TTTOTW]].

Shopping @ Home Depot. Checked out insulation, definitely have to do delivery. Still more to research to feel comfortable about it (I'm not happy that we have R-19, and we're right at the line for getting help from the state). Picked up some foam to fix some problems though. Hoses+equipment for the garden. Grabbed some seeds and incubators. Some concrete for the cracks, and another drain-unclogger for the offspring to use. Jigsaw collection, including those fit for our metal door (also may have the insulation necessary to deal with the gap we'll have to install the catdoor on it). We picked up primer and that gorgeous red paint she's wanted on her door for decades. We now have keys made for the house (not that they'll be used, but you never know). I have a real utility broom now (it's badass). Helped an old lady with her computer illiteracy (I'm fucking scared), and a feller, Miguel (and another homie) [[smalltalk]]ed me. Easy to drop a lot of money into that store. Reminds me of B&N, but I don't buy books anymore (that's for losers).

My intruder! Fuck yes. Everything is going well. I feel a lot better. 

Offspring mowed (their second time ever), and that electric mower is nifty. The cool adults (not me) worked on the raspberry and blackberry bushes, planting new berry bushes, all that garden jazz. I redid the concrete around the house, as there were cracks. 

//Skintime// and teased. Tomorrow! Wife spoke with our neighbors to the right (looking out from our house to the street). She knows the history of this place. Hard not to like my wife, and I'm glad they are the two to make first contact. I'd have said something stupid (as we all know). 

[[Family Gathering]]. A curry-like chili (imho) with dirty rice and water for me. Solid. Lots of excitement in the air tonight. Gettin' shit done around the house, new things for everyone, broski's moving to a better position, all kinda {[[dream]]}ing, yanno? 

Played a match with my son. I simply have too much firepower and universal control, though he almost went infinite with Pulse/Elixir/LoA/Forbid/etc. We don't do shit for 4 turns, but then I drop bombs for the rest of the game. Lots of wiggle room in how I built my deck, and I can't say I know I've gone the correct direction.

[[TTTOTW]], then fell asleep before midnight. Wat.
