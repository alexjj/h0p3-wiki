title: 2021.01.02 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Reactive Hiki

* Try To Take Over The World
* //House of Cards//
* Sleep by 7
* Woke at 1:30
* //Skintime//->Assisted Fireman Time!
* Try To Take Over The World
* Fireman Time!
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Offspring on tasks
* //The Walk//
** Keep the reactive hiki sane. We both needed the exercise. 
** There are many dogs in our neighborhood. I've yet to see a cat; presumably all indoors. 
** Higher rates of conservatives than I'd have guessed. That is a discomforting thought long-term. My wife will speak for both of us.
* Made dinner with offspring; accountability went poorly.
* Called [[JRE]] Back
** Signal has too much feedback for speaker. 
** They just got back from a walk too. Quinn doesn't care for the wagon.
** Gonna be an influential month for my brother: test, new meds, picking work back up, party, and daycare...on top of the zillion other things. 
*** A cleaner beneficiary of the safety net (fewer tatters).
** Δ⁸ discussion, oh and ⁸Δ⁸ (reminder*).
** Enjoying //Cyberpunk 2077//, especially the story, trying not to read about minmaxing/ludology of the game. Felt it was quite dark.  
*** Spoke a bit about Witcher 3. 
**** Ludological optimization and ugly females in [[vidya]] [[games]]. 
* Try To Take Over The World
* //Skintime// until she couldn't hold her book up any longer.
* Nap/Delirium
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Chili, peaches, cake, and water
** [[MTG]]: 
*** Offspring played their usual, probably a turn disadvantaged for my daughter. She continues to improve with the many decisions in her deck. My son is getting better at bluffing. I heard sound reasons in their stories.
*** Wife's Thesh vs Infect +1: Rift bolt suspend is too late, T3 combo unanswered. 
*** Wife's Thresh vs D&T: Thalia was a complete lockout, scooped. In reverse, counters on both vials with 1-land vs. 2 delvers, scooped.

sudo pacman -S arandr --noconfirm

Thus far, it is the simplest way I've found for the vertical monitor. Sidebar on wiki should collapse in one of the toggles. 

Don't like the way the edges catch moving from vertical to horizontal. That should be scalable. 

I need to go back through [[.i3/config]] to make it clean on reboot too.
