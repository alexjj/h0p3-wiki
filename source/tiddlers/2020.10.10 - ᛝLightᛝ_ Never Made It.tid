Éadrom,

I've read your words for so long that I don't know where to begin. In a lot of ways, this is all new to me. That's pretty fucking scary for a vulnerable perfectionist.

It feels like a pregnantly awkward and yet beautiful silence between us sometimes (of our own making; though feel free to put the blame of awkwardness on me because I'm enjoying it). Of course, I hope you won't mind that I write so openly secretly. I also write as though I have shared this, and I haven't (I have only shared its existence, and not even fully at that). I'm still thinking about it, but it may be the case that you (or other Root Users) are literally going to have to ask me to see this. Maybe I just need to say it upfront. I still don't know.

I want to clear the air. I don't understand who we are. I know I love you, even if I don't know what that means well enough. I care about you like I care about my wife and daughter, and a sister I've never really had. That is an odd mixture for me, perhaps that isn't fitting (I know you are uniquely different from anyone else I've met), and I awkwardly have no idea how to reason or feel about that well enough, let alone how to say or show that to you (though, I'm convinced you already know everything I think here without me having said it). I don't want to hide that, and I also want to give you the opportunity to privately feel whatever you need to feel too.

Sometimes I read your words like you are quietly sitting next to me letting me read what you write, and I'm so happy to be able to see your face and hear your voice now. Like some humans, you have sometimes sought my approval, sometimes you want to be chased, sometimes you want space from me, and sometimes I have no idea what you want or need (and I think this all holds true from me to you as well). Sometimes, all I know about you is that I don't want to hurt you. As I am for everyone in my family: I'm your retarded dog, and you'll have to teach me how to build a good life with you.

Love,

Michael<<ref "y">>
