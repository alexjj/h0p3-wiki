title: 2020.12.17 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Spank It

* Folks were still up. I got all my XOXOs (plus, icy hands for my wife). 
* We found 3 more boxes of food from the dry ark. I knew we were missing some.
** My offspring did not try their best, but organizing the pantry at this point requires practice. 
** Finished off all the other cooking instruments, but I have left tupperware/glass storage to my offspring. That is their world. 
* They still aren't getting the kitchen right, but it's closer. Finishing the job for them. I'm tired of fighting.
* Laundry
* Attempted sleep by 5, but it didn't happen until 8?
* Woke at 11:30
** Bad dreams, ideation too. =/
* Read
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Shower
* Offspring sent to shovel snow and dig the cars out. Interesting to see they had fun with it.
* Talking with my wife. Been a chill day for her. I'm hoping that it will settle into something simple and she'll maintain the ability to work from home a bit more. It will only take a few years for her to cement herself; she naturally becomes indispensable because she actually cares about her work (it's vocation). Dream days would be 4 hours of real work with research after that, I think.
* Inform the Men!
* Meditation
* Made lunch for folks
** They liked the pickled artichokes this time around. Neat.
* [[MTG]]: while we ate together.
** Son's MUC vs Soul Sisters, +3, +2: Proclamation ruled the games. Forcing Serra through before 6 Islands (only lost because he's running 22 Islands and didn't change up). Incorrect shackles usage hurt him in the other.
*** Talked about the math behind that land count. It can be difficult to feel the difference between one card without hundreds of games in some cases (and "feel" is used very loosely there). 
** Daughter's Affinity vs Soul Sisters, +1, +1: we're calling Ajani Pridemate "Johnny" now, though I never played one. It's a control deck comprised of creatures. Lots to talk about there. Suture Priest makes the clamp route unpalatable, and proclamation allowed for 6cc edicts until alphastrike.
* Son wanted to finish the snow job. Cool (literally).
** He feels accomplished when he gets it done, as he says. Real shit, I hear that.
* Daughter and I finished the ping-pong table. 
** Cheapest I've ever seen, but it'll do.
** There's less space for it in the attic (despite it being a huge attic) than I thought.
* Pingpong
** in ur face, u suck
** They've never played. My daughter did much better than I thought she would too. My prediction was wrong there.
** Scared of the smashes, but they need to know where we are headed. Eventually, they won't be afraid of it and instead start positioning in advance.
*** Watching the opponent's body aint easy for them yet. Mostly just trying to see the ball.
** I'm hoping it will be quite the tool for my son. He's already hating it a bit though; it's a reminder of his autistic limits. I hear that. Maybe in a year it will be different. I [[hope]] so. It's a chance to feel comfortable in his skin, and he needs it if he really wants to work with his hands.
** To say I'm rusty is an understatement. Some of my instincts came back quick enough, but I think it will be like Tribes: I'll never be good again. Still, good enough to get the job done here.
** We giggled a lot, and my daughter is a god-tier memer sometimes. She's been raised on the absolute worst diet imaginable. 
** We desperately need to fix the attic edges. Ball retrieval is heinous. 
*** I need to make it safe too. Too many nails (already having to be careful about the ceiling as is). 
* Called [[JRE]] Back
** Speech therapy continues, and they will be injecting more sign language. May it be a bridge.
** Matthew is feeling the pull of TV now, screaming for it. Elmo makes me scream too.
** Brother didn't seem to recommend his motorized gaming chair much, so I won't go that direction.
** Hard to get off on these meds, feeling depressed too, still gonna wait it out for full effect.
*** Still prefers speed, obviously, especially for the possibility of weight loss. I hear that.
** Original oculus hasn't shown up for us yet, he was surprised. His new one is dope, no screen door effect, and he's going to jailbreak it.
*** FB watching his penis.
** Matthew finally got some tubes in his ears, and they have to be careful about it.
** Renee the Babysitter and her father who lacked a finger.
** Potrack (the rare picture from me, by request).
** Thinking that a generator for the heater might be worthwhile. He recommends it.
*** I'd like to see his opinion in general walking through the house.
** Thanked him again for my kleins. 
** Made in USA bullying from his union, fair wage requirements, and then a tangent onto trade agreement theory and scaling wages.
*** JWaters didn't even bid on government contracts that had scaling (up to union wages, ~$50/h after benefits) because it causes problems (obviously, lol). There's been some legal policy changes that killed scaling recently. 
*** Started to dig into black markets and why I'm still convinced taxation is the only route that works here. He had to go, but maybe we'll talk about it later.
* Moar pingpong
** I'm trying to show them what it means to practice [[FTSO]] improving yet again. The world is filled with games, [[love]]s. [[gfwiwcgws]]. Seems like a [[SO]] instrumentality.
*** Pure grinds of 2/3 matches on rotation. 
** Wallball. haven't shown them how to use the table to practice solo yet (but, it's not the sort that really should be handled much).
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Lasagna. It was exceptional. Serving sizes are never appropriate. 
** [[MTG]]
*** Son's MUC vs Pox +1, 0, 0: FoW on Rit, then top Rit->CoW, Strip, GG. Strip, strip, eventually CoW, Pox, hardlock. Rit->Pit, deep dive into our decks but attrition for Rack took it (despite ACall, Time Walk, etc.).
