title: 2021.07.28 - Prompted Introspection: Spiritual Experience

!! Have you ever had (what you consider to be) a spiritual experience? If so, what was it like and what effects did it have on you?

This is an expensive topic for me. I've had many, [[WINTCIS]] regarding whatever [[gfwiwcgws]] we wish to nail down here. I've spoken of this before. I'll state the hard part first: perception of anything at all requires [[The Good]], and there is no intentionality without spirituality (however thin, misused, misunderstood, etc.). Obviously, as [[awe]] demonstrates, not all spiritual experiences correspond to something objective and external to us. Experience "of" [[W5H]]? 

[[Music]] clearly has that effect on me. Drugs can do it. Holding a person I [[love]]. I can read a [[letter]] and experience it. This was before HPPD and my schizo ways too. Spiritual experiences admit of [[dok]], it seems. It is not clear to me that we escape experiencing the divine in any mode as Dasein, but I'll agree our awareness of it varies considerably, let alone our willingness to admit or recognize such things.

I really don't fit in with most people who consider themselves spiritual, religious, mystical, etc. But, I defend their place ferociously (often without their approval). I've tried to shed it. I can't, and I see why.
