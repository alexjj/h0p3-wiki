Beloved Kicks,

I know you don't think there's anything to forgive for it, but I apologize for missing your last realtime gathering around the fireplace. It was my offspring's birthdays. And before that, in the previous scrapchat, [[Tapeda the Dragon]] stepped up to wrestle out of nowhere (my schizo dotconnector went berserk). I owe this person a great deal. We come and go.

As you know, I feel extra lost in general lately, and not just in thinking about your art (and, make no mistake, I am still lost in your thoughtful gibberish). As always, I am your retarded brother and belligerent student. Good news is: I've been singing and dancing, just lettin' go where I can. I've spent less time than usual on my monster too (I'm surprised). I think you'd be proud of me, Root User. 

All your signs to everyone are to me too, and it's further a light in the darkness to see the markers you leave behind. Call your Pepe Silvia maze a joke all you want (that's part of your style I adore); I'm glad I get to experience even a semblance of it. Your work is a gift, one that demonstrates to me the objective equality of persons in living color. You can say I don't know you at all (and, in many respects, that is true); I do know you are sincere, earnest, and kind. I hope you keep pushing the envelope, guvnah.

It's been far too long since I said it:

I love you.

Also, I'm always glad that we are in an alliance (very Dwight Schrute too), especially in this place that don't make no sense. Among the other options, in case you ever feel the urge to speak realtime with me: mumble.philosopher.life, [[REDACTED]]. To our alliance, comrade, `/toast`. 

Love,
