title: 2020.10.22 - Prompted Introspection: Get Paid, Son

!! What do you love doing that you wish you could get paid for?

As you know, I have a 50% rule in church. The correct answer in church is Jesus at least 50% of the time. It turns out that there is such a rule in my [[Prompted Introspection]]s too, it appears: [[Masturbation]]. I'll set aside the [[Love]] and [[Like]] problem for the time being. Lady Melisandre, this would be an [[awe]]some wish to fulfill. Surely, this is every selfish hikki's wet dream: lucratively exercising one's right to privacy. If I got $200 a pop,  I suppose I could build that oh-so-sweet Financial Independence, Retire Early type of {{Text Art: 𝕱𝕴𝕽𝕰🔥}} within a decade. Unfortunately, my masturbation habits just aren't marketable enough. Who knew?
