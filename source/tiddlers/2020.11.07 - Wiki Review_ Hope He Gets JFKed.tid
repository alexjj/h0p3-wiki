title: 2020.11.07 - Wiki Review: Hope He Gets JFKed

* [[Who Is This Anonymous?]]
** Look at this person, doing it way before it was cool. I'm jelly.
* [[2020.11.06 - Wiki Review: Cope]]
** I can only [[hope]] that younger generations are not going to fall for the Biden trap. He's a capitalist, through and through. It's too easy to make this mistake. I was going to feel bristly no matter what. This one is more insidious; it's too easy to lose {[[Focus]]} given the storycrafting.
