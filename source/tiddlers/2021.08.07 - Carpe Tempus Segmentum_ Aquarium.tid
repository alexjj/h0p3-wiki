[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! Cleaning. Attempted sleep by 2, but raced for a long time. No idea what time I fell asleep.

Woke at 10. Antsy. I've been hiki long enough that traveling makes me anxious, especially if I'm not convinced it's necessary. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. [[Morning Routine]]. Hugs'n'bugs. Tried not to interrupt my wife's bookclub, which is really her opportunity to continue her relationship with Mary over videochat (I'm walking around in my underwear, ofc...maybe she got a free show).

Both of my cards failed at the gas station, god damn chip error. I was flustered enough to have forgotten my own zip code. Not a good start for traveling. I'm, like...meh, maybe this isn't even worth it. Ordered a new one, and cleaned the other (since that might be the problem, but I doubt it). The trip was pleasant, but parking was horrendous at this tourist trap. Absolutely packed; it was Six Flags, King's Island, Universal Studios, Cedar Point, Disney levels packed with the same atmosphere. How can we convince you to part with a thousand dollars because this is a special occasion?<<ref "th">>

I'm glad everyone is older. There's no hand-holding at any level. We got to pet the fucking stringrays!<<ref "s">> Sea lion show is for patriotic dog people who enjoy praise and worship music, temporarily embarrassed princesses, and Bozo the Clown divorce papers breakdown episodes (I was entertained). I hope the sea lions adore it (cute AF, and it is a privilege to watch them swim). They were wielded by their owners.<<ref "p">> The girls at each station are evangelists, squeeling and preaching the neoliberalized gospel, so plz clap along. Muscular beluga whales, and despite plenty of space, two strange species gathered together at the wall, wailing, playing, and inspecting. Sea lions outside were pinballs bouncing, an occasional zoomie. Human babies everywhere add to the cuteness, and watching hot mammaries watch other mammals is my treat. That is the best penguin exhibit I've witnessed (probably seen a dozen in my life). The lone turtle king of the lily field...nm found the army, and something that isn't algae (though I know not what) so thick the frogs were crawling on top of it. The sharks did not want to be touched, but I enjoyed the menagerie of ancient fish with artificially extended lives (many were clearly blind). The jelly fish section is the star of the fucking show!<<ref "j">> Octopus exhibit (covered in large starfish) could have been, but they are NOT happy.<<ref "w">> We hit the giant crabs, and I realized that I am hungry. Eels were like bobbit worms, but uber cute (with that dash of shyness  I adore). One word, two syllables: ~~demarcation~~ Mudkip. Creepy gars starring us down, but the paddlefish are so goofy that we can't escalate our staredown. I wish I had some shrooms or LSD for the coral and bioluminescent exhibits (some of them were already on the edge of making me question if they were real). Saw paintings made by various animals. They are pretty bad at it. 

Neckrubs for her. She still tight.

He asked me about what we can do to house and feed everyone on the planet right now, the basics. We rabbitholed until the girls came out of the bathroom. Also, the boys were in consistent agreement today. We 'mired, we saw enough, and we were ready to go. My son is so polite he would never admit that he's ready to go, so I need to make sure I'm asking more often. We kept running into each other, two autists apologizing before they knew what happened, then both were doing the `/nod`, oh, yes, it's absurdly crowded in here, no worries, gotchufam. I'll let you know if we catch delta.

On the way back, found a picnic-style diner on the side of the road (the owner sized me up immediately and clearly understood I'm retarded and treated me as such). The food was sick. My daughter had calamari (been a long time for her), my son a gyro, my wife crab cakes, and I had fish'n'chips (beer batter, very large fish [no idea what kind, but it was excellent]).<<ref "i">> I found a decent spot in the grassy forest area.

Zonked out in the car. No idea what time we got home. Slept hard. Knocked right out. Woke at 10:30.

[[TTTOTW]]. For the first time in my life, I looked at the pizza before her tits. I'm preparing for the end of the world now, but I do want to watch her eat it. 

Talked with [[5c0ut]]. Showed me an interesting cake, and he talked about the nursing program near us, highly ranked. A co-worker of his had been a nurse for 35 years, so he's been pickin' her brain. Took a shit. [[TTTOTW]].

<<footnotes "j" "Some weren't technically jellyfish, but were made of jelly. Some of them lit up like elegant, tiny RGB LEDs. The small ones were the most transparent and the cutest (I want one, but I would probably accidentally kill it). One tank contained moon jellyfish that was so alien it actually looked like it belonged in the Alien franchise. Another contained jellyfish that could live quite deep underwater, and the tank was pitch black (for a second, I was worried it wasn't real, as though it were just an extremely high resolution screen). I've never been so close to this kind of jellyfish before; my family had to drag me away from it.">>
