* Supporting a political apparatus that gives you freedom to live your delusion does not require me to participate in your self-image, especially when it comes into conflict with my self-image.

* people are like a house of cards and im afraid of adding more cards to them
* i dont know if i want to fight you or fuck you, but I know i cant fly away. I seek the fitting middle grounds, whatever fourth f is necessary, of course. That measurement is not mine alone to make. Animals accepting each [[others]]' instincts aint easy to do. Primality is not a word I will ever understand well enough. We do not escape the matter of [[faith]] in intention, in trust, in probably both like and love. I am happy to just be there.

* The wiki, like any modeling tool, is a thought factory to some irreducible (though I need not say complete) [[dok]].
* Honestly, feedback-strangelooped //honesty//, even in imagination, is exponentially valuable in [[The Great Human Conversation]].  
* Creating Context, Art, Science, Moral

* I hate who you want to be or who you are willing to be, and that's why I hate part of who you are.
* Atomize then Anatomize
* What questions would you ask to get the most information about who a person truly is?
* People who aren't or don't have much of a self must distract themselves from that terrifying fact.
* inexperienced consumers of innumerable dependencies
