*** One of my favorite things to do when I was your age was to just try new software all the time. You know this. I have learned so much about the world through something as silly as that (like readin' books I guess). A good programmer will surely understand the discrete, physical process and up the stack, but don't forget to master the highest abstractions: those end up being the practical ones most of the time. It's low-hanging fruit, even for a retard like me.

*** `/rant on` Even setting aside the problem of theodicy (and work to be a generous interlocutor), I slit almost plenty of self-proclaimed Christian's throat who stands toe-to-toe with me for this one (I have since I was your age). I demand they take Jesus' words seriously (and recontextualized) if they want me to take theirs seriously. Humbly and critically look deep inside the people around you. 3% (and that's the exeedingly charitable percentage). Don't forget it. You must be able to say that most people really are evil without losing [[hope]]. It's very expensive in a number of respects. You will be lucky to meet even a 100 Real^^tm^^ Christans in your lifetime ([[The Good]] ones, ya know). It is a dying tradition in the US. Still, most of what counts as society is a set of vampiric lies you must play along with to some [[dok]] to survive; all else being equal, it is a deception that is justified defection in [[Gradual]]ized [[T42T]]. As a matter of hedged humility and prudence, practice tolerance in service to the [[others]], but do not confuse realpolitik action with the truth. Though many will attempt to deny it, everyone has a god they serve. What will your mission be? [[gfwiwcgws]]/ `/rant off`

*** There's something to be said for having taught children. As usual, I have no fucking clue what counts as [[art]]. I don't think you should go this route, btw (though you could nail this particular schtick [just have to know people, right?]). I like your work more.
