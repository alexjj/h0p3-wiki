You both like Philosophy.
Stranger: hello
You: Hello!
You: What brings you here today?
Stranger: looking for more learning opportunites
You: Hell yeah
Stranger: about the world
Stranger: hellyes!
You: <3
Stranger: what is love to you
You: That is probably the best answer I've heard so far today. Most are "bored" or "horny"
You: Excellent question!
Stranger: oh i see!!
You: And, I have a very specific answer.
Stranger: if you can explain love in words
You: https://philosopher.life/#Love
Stranger: that would be so fantastic
You: I have done my best.
Stranger: cool site
You: Gracias.
Stranger: do you have any questions for me?
You: What are you looking to learn about? Are you [[aim]]ing to learn formally and for credentials?
You: I [[hope]] to equip you, wrestle with you, do whatever I can to [[help]].
Stranger: are you a bot
Stranger: sir
You: I am not.
You: Do you need proof?
Stranger: what is 2+4
You: 6
Stranger: that is my proof
Stranger: correct..
Stranger: intresting...
You: Sec, getting one more proof for you.
Stranger: i see
You: As, anyone could masquerade as though they owned my ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱
Stranger: i would love to learn about stocks
Stranger: you know bitcoin?
You: I know some about these spaces.
You: Those are very different to my eyes.
Stranger: or stoicism
Stranger: why do you speak so formal?
Stranger: may i ask such questions.
You: I am autistic. And, you may ask me any question. I will do my best to answer it as charitably as I know how.
Stranger: why are you on omegle
You: Oh, to [[Find The Other]], nomad.
You: When I speak with [[anonymous]] people, they take their masks off, show their true colors, I get to see what they really think and feel. It is important that I practice wrestling with them.
Stranger: how old are you sir
You: Last proof, just synced up: https://philosopher.life/#%40%3A%20FTO%20Proofs
Stranger: may i ask for your name
You: I am 36. My name is h0p3.
You: I have been accused of being a [[bot|Aispondence]] and worse many times.
You: It comes with the territory of my vocation and disposition.
You: As to bitcoin and stocks, I'm a novice about many sections of these things. I was one of the original bitcoin miners (back when I lived in Thailand), but I was doubtful then it was worth anything (and I remain doubtful that it is today...though I am happy to speak of cryptocurrencies that might be of use).
Stranger: i love to hear your experiences in thailand
You: My friend, [[BCS]] <---that's a link you can search up in the wiki, has some expertise in political leftist perspectives on cryptocurrency too (worth a glance at least).
Stranger: what is the value of a human life
You: I moved when my son, [[1uxb0x]] was born, back in 2008, stayed for a couple years, teaching, started an orphanage to get kids out of the sex slavery.
You: Humans are not necessarily persons. A fetus is human, but that doesn't make it sapient, and it doesn't entail the rights of personhood. The value of personhood is best understood in terms of Saint Aristotle's NE's human telos and Saint Kant's Kingdom of Ends.
Stranger: can you put that into simple terms?
You: Our dignity, our intrinsic value, arises from our autonomy, our ability to choose to do what is [[right]] for the sake of it being right.
You: Which part?
You: I will have hard time reducing 11 years of post-secondary education fast enough.
Stranger: i see
Stranger: are you friends with elon musk
You: No. I know a man who Daddy Elon follows, his name is [[gwern]]. I am no fan of Elon.
You: I consider the man incredibly evil.
Stranger: evil? in what ways?
You: He exploits people, uses them as mere means.
Stranger: i truly believe he is caple of incredable things
You: He is genius.
You: That doesn't make him moral.
You: Hitler did incredible things.
Stranger: how so
You: What does it mean to do something incredible?
You: To my eyes, this is a positivist's term, nearly. It's value neutral in some respects. Some people are capable of doing incredibly evil things.
Stranger: may i ask you a question?
You: Hitler accomplished absurdly difficult tasks. Changed the world as we know it.
You: Sure, of course.
Stranger: hmm
Stranger: is what the majority of people decide always right or can it be wrong>
You: Prima facie, the majority can be wrong. Appeals to the majority are a fallacy. It is not deductively the case that just because a majority of agents believe or vote or pick one thing that it is morally justified.
You: However, there is a complication here when we attempt to define what consists in [[Justice]].
Stranger: what was one of the most difficult choices you made in your lifetime>
You: Leaving academia was a hard one.
You: I invested quite a bit of my life into it.
Stranger: what did you study?
You: Philosophy
You: Analytic, but I was lucky enough to study with some Continental professors as well.
Stranger: i have another question to ask you
Stranger: is there a moral obligation to help the less fortunate
You: Ask away, and feel free to ask me to ask questions too*
Stranger: if so, how much should you help
You: We have radical moral obligations to the global poor.
Stranger: or how much should our country help its own poor citizens versus the poor citizens of other countries?
You: I don't think we own ourselves all the way down, and, in times of crisis, as we face in capitalism atm, we do not have a right to simply do just anything. Revolution is our only [[hope]]. We owe this not only to the living, but even future generations as well.
You: Saint Rawls' is well worth your time, my friend!
Stranger: if revolution is our only hope, what possible solutions are there in the future for us?
You: Behind the [[Veil of Ignorance]], we do not know our [[moral luck]], our morally arbitrary characteristics of where we would be born, and in this sense, [[justice]] is blind. We must be cosmopolitans that work to help people internationally.
You: I do not predict our success, my friend.
You: I believe that rebuilding the internet with the correct protocols (and, with nation-state level investment, these tools are possible to build), would allow the workers/users/people to own the means of political production, to have real-time electronic voting worldwide, censorship resistant, with all the properties required to bind us together. It's a pipe {[[dream]]}, but the only shot we have from what I can see.
You: Some people in the blockchain space see parts of this problem (but, note, of course, that a distributed ledger is wildly different...if you care for this, Ethereum is probably the leading major blockchain to consider...though it is a far cry from what we require).
You: A revolution that does not produce a criterion of authority qua distributed voting mechanisms enforced by cryptography will fall to fiat and other transnational powers.
Stranger: insane
You: Yeah. I know. =(.
You: I am retarded.
Stranger: what do you wonder about everyday?
You: Oh, well, you can see for yourself. I have Geschwind Syndrome, and I write every day.
Stranger: can you go on a tangent about a concept you couldn't understand?
You: https://philosopher.life/#New
Stranger: or your personal life?
You: https://philosopher.life/#%24%3A%2Fcore%2Fui%2FSideBar%2FRecent
You: I may be the most well-documented human alive. My personal life is right there.
You: I don't know what it means to go on a tangent about what I don't understand well enough. This reminds me of problems of speaking of the ineffable. One interesting parallel is what I find in Saints Kant, Wittgenstein, and Hegel in how they try to speak of that which they warn us not to speak about.
You: It is a fundamental problem in philosophy. What are we to do and say, wisely and humbly, of the noumena?
You: (note, these philosophers spent enormous amounts of time breaking their own rule, lol)
Stranger: will this chat end up on that website?
You: Of course.
Stranger: possibily>
Stranger: which university did you attend?
You: Berea College, LSU, Tulane
You: Took some classes at some others. Also have a professional/technical diploma for Pipefitting.
You: How about you?
Stranger: are you married?
You: Where are you going to school?
Stranger: stanford university
You: Yes. [[k0sh3k]], for 16 years.
You: Damn!
You: Noice.
You: What are you studying?
Stranger: noice?!!!
Stranger: guess
You: No idea.
Stranger: psychology
Stranger: !!
You: I am jelly. You have an amazing opportunity there.
Stranger: did you get married at age 20?
You: 19
Stranger: sooo highschool sweetheart?
You: I graduated college at 19
Stranger: ?!
You: Met her there, argued in our religion seminars with her.
You: She's brilliant (works at Yale)
Stranger: can i know her name>?
You: I'm sorry. I cannot.
Stranger: okayyy moving on
You: `/salute`
You: Tell me about how school is going for ya
Stranger: what are some books you love
Stranger: school? well its tough
You: Well, yeah, lol. Has it been transformative? Met any people that have rocked your world?
Stranger: certainly
Stranger: butttt give me some book recommendations!
You: Do you intend to use it as a networking platform? Many people I've met see it from that angle.
You: I am a huge fan of [[Dune]].
You: My son is reading it. It's a special book to me.
Stranger: oh hes into sci fi
You: Rawls' //A Theory of Justice// is worth your time, given your questions (though you need to find a serious scholar to understand some parts of it...most of what he says can be discarded).
You: Yeah. I'd say so. We've been covering the //Foundation// series (Asimov) in my hiki basement this past week.
Stranger: why are you up so late?
You: It's part of my vocation, I think. I'm a nightowl, though my waking hours vary considerably.
You: I'm on the hunt for answers, just like you. =).
You: Huge fan of [[The Matrix]] btw.
You: [[Adam Nemecek]] and [[SNilsen]] have done a fine job of convincing me that researching online is often more important than what we'd find in most books (which isn't to say I don't value books).
You: It's your turn to answer my question. =)
Stranger: ok!
Stranger: what is it?
You: Above. Do you see your education at Stanford as a networking opportunity? Is it primarily that for you?
You: How has it been transformative for you?
You: Why do you wish to learn?
You: What is your purpose in life (carbon-based life form! :P)?
You: Where do you come from? It is very hard climb to where you find yourself.
You: What are your parents like? Do you have siblings?
Stranger: well, i came to omegle at this hour to have a solid conversation about life. my job as a student is to try to read, write, and think more closely or with a critical eye.
You: For the sake of what?
Stranger: curiosity?
You: To sate that desire.
You: Quite a treadmill.
Stranger: well to answer one of your questions
Stranger: i am an orphan
Stranger: i was left on the streets of shanghai at an age i cannot remember
Stranger: im lying
Stranger: im an only child
Stranger: my childhood was like any other
Stranger: but at least i was a gifted child XD
Stranger: thats why i got my ass to stanford if ya know what i mean ehehehe
You: Do you see your life as being concerned with the pursuit of the aesthetic, new experiences, and so forth?
Stranger: meow
You: lol
Stranger: well yes
You: I'd like to recommend my [[Root User]], Sir [[kickscondor]]. https://kickscondor.com/
You: They have a good eye and a good heart.
Stranger: what was your childhood like?
Stranger: what should i search for in that website
You: I think [[intimacy]] at this point requires you tell me your story. I promise you'll have plenty of time to explore my ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱.
You: You've dodged my questions.
Stranger: do you know how to get into the dark web
You: My childhood was complex. I cannot narrow it down fast. I am the son of two pastors.
You: Yes, I can assist you reaching parts of the dark web.
You: I think The Tor Browser is an excellent starting place for someone who is new. Make sure you turn javascript off.
Stranger: well then
Stranger: do think having autism was a set back in your life?
You: In some respects, yes.
You: You might find https://astralcodexten.substack.com/ worth your time. I have plenty of disagreements with this human, but they do a fine job of interrogating the notion of autism.
You: I think having grown up in poverty and being brainwashed were much greater setbacks. I have a difficult time interpreting people, and I have to bend over backwards to model them.
You: I ask you to be honest with me at all times.
Stranger: sir
Stranger: it was pleasant to have this conversation with you tonight
Stranger: but i have to say goodbye
Stranger: :)
You: Indeed. Thank you for your time.
Stranger: we might meet again in the future
You: `/salute`. Anytime. [[Contact h0p3]].
Stranger: good bye!
Stranger has disconnected.

Forgot, here's [[Stoicism-fu]] and [[Redpilled Stoicism]] for ya. I think you should question passive investment. Otherwise, I've left you with plenty to think about. Do your best to be wise, human.

You: Yup. Sometimes they hit me really bad too. I've been pretty lucky lately.
You: You take anything for it?

You: You have any animals that live with you?

I suppose we should focus on their allergies, and don't do anything weird like using aliases or scary syntax. Don't remind me that we're [[anonymous]] either because that creeps me out.

You: Yeah. =/.
Stranger: Employment means exploiting these days
You: I see. Yes. I agree to that claim.
You: Do have any particular examples in mind?
Stranger: Ya i just applied for an internship and they weren't sending me the offer letter and were demanding dta entry work
Stranger: *data
You: Ugh.
You: Sounds like a scam.
Stranger: Now that's a professional service and i can't just give away my service for free
Stranger: So anyway
Stranger: It didn't work out
You: I get that.
You: Sorry.
Stranger: It's fine
You: What do you do for money when covid isn't demolishing the social fabric?
You: (or, please, feel free to change the topic, I'm happy to speak about whatever is more interesting to you)
Stranger: That's what i worry about most of the day because i have tinnitus and I'm into music
You: That is not a good combination. Lol.
Stranger: I know that's why I can't apply for jobs in the same field till my aural problem is treated
You: I just recently finished updating my [[Music: Library]]. https://philosopher.life/#Music%3A%20Library (this won't load quickly, nor is it quite fitting for a phone, imho)
You: Oof
You: And, I assume that it's difficult to find treatment at the moment, with covid probably requiring so many medical infrastructure resources.
You: (it's been that way here in the states, at least)
Stranger: I'm also interested in Retail and have tried freelancing and earningoney online from youtube, spotify, etc but nothing seems to work
Stranger: *money
You: So many people competing in these spaces.
Stranger: Oh I'm very non competetive
You: As a matter of principle or sentiment, or why is that?
You: (sometimes I have to set aside my competitiveness because it's simply not constructive enough)
Stranger: I just never liked competing when i know my self worth and no exams can dictate that you know
You: That is a complex problem. Capitalism aims to commodify everything. Our value in the market is no indicator of our dignity or objective moral worth.
You: You face significant high stakes testing?
Stranger: It just doesn't matter to me because i know my self worth
Stranger: The stakes are manipulated anyway
You: I agree.
You: It's an interesting phrase to me, as many people I've met who say "I know my worth" are speaking about their market value. But, I don't think that's what you mean.
Stranger: I rather sit at home, practice playing musical instruments than working some shit job
You: Livin' the {[[dream]]}, my friend.
You: What instruments do you enjoy playing?
Stranger: No just self worth which can't be measured
You: Do you play by ear at all?
Stranger: Ya by ear and by theory
You: I agree there are significant problems in trying to quantify such a thing. You would agree we can at least speak of it meaningfully though, right?
Stranger: I chose the classical guitar as my principle instrument
You: Hell yeah.
You: You got any particular pieces of guitar music that blow your mind?
You: I'm always on the hunt.
You: I'm a huge fan of these https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGTxqhSN8bE and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXqPYte8tvc
Stranger: You can check out Francesco tarrega
You: Listening now
You: It's magic, my friend.
You: How much do you end up practicing each day?
You: Do you split your day into two practice sessions?
Stranger: Cool, i just checked the first link
Stranger: I'm not practicing at all because of this
You: I bet your family is insanely lucky to hear you play.
You: You must bring joy to them all.
Stranger: I didn't like the second link
Stranger: Eh
Stranger: They are interested in shit music i don't appreciate so i don't care usually what they think about my playing
You: Oh.
You: I used to play piano semi-seriously.
You: But, I don't play any instruments anymore. I just listen.
You: I'm a simple man, lol.
You: Even if you don't care what they think about your playing, I bet there are times where they are moved by it.
Stranger: Like the Indian idol
Stranger: Full of shit
You: I've never seen it. If it anything like American Idol, I am sure it is terrible.
You: Another one for you, my friend: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8oi5RuEZro
Stranger: Yes it's like American idol
You: (not guitar*)
You: Music makes me cry and dance often. I spend a lot of time trying to put words to things. Sometimes music is the only thing that does it well.
Stranger: Woah
Stranger: How are you searching this music
Stranger: It is cool
You: I am [[grateful]] that I can provide anything that would suit your virtuous ear.
You: I use my [[computer]] like you wish to play your guitar.
Stranger: I use mine too but it has issues
Stranger: My network has been pretty restricted
You: Ah. What kind of restrictions?
Stranger: But what you shared is soulful
You: <3
Stranger: Like the network has become limited
You: A hard problem to solve. What's your bandwidth throughput like (download and upload) on average?
Stranger: I have saved them so i can watch and listen later
Stranger: Except the 2nd link
You: If you look above, I have linked you to my collection (only 500 songs, most you will hate, but some you may find worthy).
Stranger: I don't have wifi, i use my brothers
Stranger: :(
You: I am glad that you are able to use his. My site is a single html file. You can download it once and browse it entirely offline (highly functional). Just in case you might find it interesting.
Stranger: But how is it a collection or playlist
You: I am engaged in the process of finding 10GB of music I would take with me to a desert island. The music I would want to listen to eternally.
You: I study the concepts of [[The Good]] and [[The Beautiful]] and [[The Right]]. [[Music]] is a [[power]]ful example and demonstrator to me.
Stranger: I thought you were going to cringe me by saying the good, the bad and the ugly
You: Hehe.
Stranger: As long as i am away from cringe, i am good
You: Well, unfortunately, there is quite a bit of cringe not just in my [[Music: Library]], but in my work and my life in general. Sometimes I have to kill not the cringe, but the part of me that cringes.
Stranger: Oh that must suck
You: A friend of mine (a [[Root User]]) tells me he is on a quest to find 𝕱𝕴𝕽𝕰🔥 in the world. It's something I think about often.
Stranger has disconnected.

I wish you [[luck]], my friend. I [[hope]] you'll at least have some music to listen to. If you want more recommendations, I'm happy to make suggestions (I think I've got a lock on what you [[like]] now).

Stranger: You?
You: Standard answer. hehe. Othertimes, I hear "Horny" or "IDK."
You: I come to speak with strangers, to face [[The Other]].
You: I meet lots of interesting folk here.
Stranger: Why are there two sets of brackets around “the other”?
You: (and, I've finally figured out what that "kicked" bot does on Omegle...so feeling good about that)
You: Ah, that's a [[good]] question.
Stranger: What does that bot do?
You: This is my personal site (it's crazier than you might initially think): https://philosopher.life. And, that [[Foobar]] is the syntax for internal [[link]]ing within the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱.
You: The bot seems to bind together everyone into a group chat. The bot acts as a conduit.
You: Here's a record of the chat I just left with it: http://logs.omegle.com/068127fb0865a766
Stranger: I knew that it was some sort of bot/group chat hybrid.
Stranger: I just don’t know precisely how it works.
You: I never stuck around long enough to figure it out. I was surprised when it felt like it was passing the turing test at time with me.
You: Aint no [[GPT-3|Aispondence]] bot.
Stranger: He directly replied to what I said before.
Stranger: And accused me of being a bot when I started spamming.
You: Lawd.
You: Lol.
You: I'm sure it causes headaches for many.
Stranger: I spammed “kicked” and various greetings for a solid 10 minutes.
You: Devious
Stranger: My theory is that “kicked” is when someone leaves the group chat.
You: Yes.
You: That makes good sense.
You: A clue for us, maybe. But, it's an annoying one.
You: Unfortunately, there's no way not to be impersonated. Keeps it [[anonymous]] more like a chan board, but real-time.
Stranger: Well, I visited your website.
You: Make sure to shower afterward. If you need to vomit, I understand. XD.
Stranger: Nah.
Stranger: You’re either consciously spouting nonsense to create an illusion of profundity, or you’re mentally ill.
You: I have heard these claims before.
Stranger: Neither of these possibilities makes me want to vomit.
You: I think it's difficult to know what you're looking at in just a few minutes.
Stranger: It’s difficult to know what one is looking at even after a few hours, because it’s utter nonsense.
You: Again, it would be difficult for you to have a justification at this point.
You: I appreciate that you feel that way though.
Stranger: It uses flowery language and vague generalizations to create an illusion of profundity.
You: Hrm. Where are you looking?
You: It's much, much larger than you realize (look at the source). Most of it isn't what you'll find on [[Root]]. That language is flowery (though, it's not non-sense).
Stranger: I recommend you read “Fashionable Nonsense.” What you’re doing isn’t all that original. French continental “philosophers” have been doing it for years.
You: Oh, I can appreciate that.
You: I can't say I'm a huge fan of Continental philosophy, but I do my best to understand.
Stranger: You should be a big fan. They use your approach.
You: And, yet again, you simply haven't seen enough to know what it is. I'm glad you don't think it's original. I agree that most of what I have to say has been said before.
Stranger: Your style obviously has nothing to do with analytical philosophy.
You: Lmao.
You: I am a trained analytic philosopher. Plenty of my papers in there.
You: You simply haven't explored much.
Stranger: It’s just embellished crap.
Stranger: You know what? I’m going to straight up say that you’re lying.
You: Most of it isn't even directly engaged in standard philosophy.
You: =/.
Stranger: I am going to say that you’re not a graduate-trained analytical philosopher.
Stranger: And I say that with full confidence.
You: Well, there's not much I can do. I've explained why the leap you've made isn't justified here.
Stranger: I would bet a lot on that, actually. You’re bullshitting me for some reason.
You: Most of it is a journal.
Stranger: I’d try your luck with somebody else. I’m knowledgeable enough to see your website for what it really is.
Stranger has disconnected.

We got a live one here! The bored narcissist failed the [[Ring of Gyges]] test, flying into a rage. XD. I am talented at getting underneath people's skins, not even on purpose here. I know how much analytic philosophers despise anything outside their style (and some of their arguments have merit). I appreciate kneejerk cynicism, obviously. Haters judging a book by its cover. They could have asked for more evidence or even questioned me about standard analytic arguments instead. I'm very impressed by people who know so much. They admit to trolling with the kicked bot, and then they troll me. Bounced. Well, if you read this, I'm happy to speak with you again (I don't suggest leaving any trail to yourself).
