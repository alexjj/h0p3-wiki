Thank you. That's very high praise. You've been digging deep into your own method. Fabulous! I'd like to add that understanding how to do as much of the process by hand as you can goes a very long way, much further than most would assume (though not you, obviously). I think it's an underrated approach to this problem in the community (though the zettlers and handwritten journalers tend to be exceptions), as it's too easy to get caught up in toolporn. I'm hoping we'll get to see yours in action, and I'd be happy to [[@]] with ya from our sites. Please let me know if I can be of use to you, sir.

Thanks! I will definitely check this out once again. Your site and the whole idea is spectacular.

`/wave` =) I'd like to encourage you to check out the sidebar, my friend. That's what really makes the machine work for me.
