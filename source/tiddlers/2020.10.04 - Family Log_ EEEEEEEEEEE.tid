!! Write a paragraph summarizing each person's week:

*** I had fun playing games for the ~2 days I could, the rest were meh. My computer terminal keeps me company. I'm still interested in trains, so I'll look into them more, for now, I can say they're important. I should probably look into the history of trains. I felt more tired at the end of the school week, in both my and my sisters senses.
** j3d1h
*** It sounds like your week went pretty well. Your school is getting even better, in my opinion! You don't have a ton of notes, but you have the essentials, and that's great for now. Your writing on trains in particular is really cool, and I'm happy you like it as much as you do! Your character- and world-building are both improving, I think. I'm excited to see you use your characters more!

*** I'm glad you had some free time this week, and it seems like you had fun playing games. I also appreciated your doing the kitchen towels this week. I don't know why your wiki was so wonky this week, but I did like the work you did. Lots of people have been fascinated by Egypt as one of the oldest civilizations in the world; what do you think? I'm glad you thought to tie together what the rainforests do for the world and how human action has threatened it. I think you should look into who "our" representatives and senators are; who are the people that represent us in the nation? Train wheels are cool - why do you think they make them as cones, rather than making them semi-independent the way car wheels work? While I'm glad to see your school work, I do wish you'd written about your week otherwise, too!

*** [[1uxb0x]] seemed to be in good spirits this week (overall happiness level seemed solid), although his work wasn't great. He still hasn't fixed his wiki. He didn't do his chores well. He's making progress in his mother's work though. Walks were constructive. He clearly enjoyed his Friday with his devices. His limbs are hairier. It's funny when he chastises his dad for being so immature. He's gone back to nano for his notetaking. It was my honor to watch the debate with him; it's interesting to actually respect the opinion of a 12yo manboy, and to want to know what he thinks so that I may reflect on what I think with more perspective.

** 1uxb0x
*** I forgot to send this to anyone, and I'm not writing it again, fuck this shit.
** j3d1h
*** This week wasn't horrific, just utterly predictable. I definitely enjoyed the school I got down, and the stuff I didn't was still pretty good. I have plenty of motivation and ideas to draw. Divarium has been less of a pain, and I'm slowly trying to come up with my own ideas. (It's not an authenticity problem, it's an "I just want to make something I like" problem.) I think I'll try to calm down and write more, both for school and myself.
** k0sh3k
*** I really liked your drawing of Delinquent this week; it was very 80s, which seems appropriate. Your character Asha sounds very cool! I'm glad you had the chance to talk to your friends; you're right - friends need to be able to occasionally talk about uncomfortable subjects and to disagree and hash out differences, although it's also important to be able to recognize when your friend is unhappy and sometimes it's necessary to give them space. It's a skill to know when to push and when to let go. Your work in economics and creative writing was really good; your creative writing was very poetic, and lovely. I hope you'll get over whatever block is keeping you from writing in your wiki about your other subjects, too.

*** [[j3d1h]] seemed anhedonic, coasting, doing the bare minimum not to get in deep trouble, and she's been lost in her head (I know that feel). She seems to have taken over washing the dishes during her kitchen work. She makes the best garlic bread I've ever eaten, and, she's right: it goes with chili (that bread probably goes with everything though). She's been thinking about her friend's relationships. Her week has been blurry, and that is now multiple people who have mentioned this to me this week (myself included). Maybe it is hypernormalization. Walks have been great. She has showered more. She's got these raptor hands while she types, like she's dangling claws over a palmed egg.

*** I'm sorry that I didn't have my New correct, it was working fine earlier this morning. Must suck that your back hurt. I'm happy that we're pretty likely to get a house! I liked your RCL for this week.
** j3d1h
*** I'm sorry the week was so bad for you. Work has been stressful, and so has everything else. I'm glad we're likely to get the Spring house - it's a very nice house! - but I'm mostly glad that you can seriously relax about all this, soon enough. Thank you for taking us to get flu shots (and I'm sorry we were late). I hope you can make it through this week with less stress and more time to chill.
** k0sh3k
***I'm struggling with some anxiety about the house and what needs to happen now. It still feels surreal that we are working towards getting a house! I moved a lot of books this week, and my back felt every one of them. Book club was weird - only I and MJ showed up, but we had a great time talking about our books, politics, libraries, the pandemic, and pretty much everything for a couple hours. 
** h0p3
*** [[k0sh3k]] has had a lot of aches this week. Anxiety but not depression. Huge decisions this week. Lawd. It appears her grind has felt more normal grindy. Some parts of her job she's never had the chance to do are popping up. She maintains an absurd pace, and I'm glad she takes breaks. Naps in laps were dope (Chairman Meow agrees). Sating her greedy husband, bookclub, very hot showers, steak, maybe a home, the tubes, and [[Family Gathering]]s made for a great week.

** 1uxb0x
*** Thank you for the maymays. I think we had a better week than last week, although now you think I've been lying. I'm really good at stacking mistakes, it always feels like they hit at the worst times, and you almost always reveal them!
** j3d1h
*** I think the week wasn't terrible for you, overall. It's good you were even //able// to laugh at the debate. Your conversations and friends are as interesting/confusing as always. [[Deh Ga Buh, Gi Duh Bo, Megiddo]] is hard to read - I can't find much useful context looking it up, either - but seems valuable, I guess. It looks like you're trying to take a paragraph form in CTS now, so good luck with that!
** k0sh3k
*** Walking and talking with Sphygmus seemed like a great time and a good idea; I hope you do that with your friends more often. I very much like your plan "to invent a toilet that erases the memory that you are even a creature that poops." This is a great idea. //The Lost Skeleton of Cadavera// is objectively an awesome movie; my kids have good taste, so of course they liked it. I hate that we've missed so much date-time; after we get the house bought, I hope we can settle into regular date-times again and find a cool new place to eat, although I'm going to miss poke. Maybe Portuguese food will be even better?
** h0p3
*** [[h0p3]] did [[h0p3]] things like a [[h0p3]] does, this week. Intense feeling week. The world spins faster, and he continues to have no idea what to do well enough. He's been thinkin', but that don't mean much. If ignoring the world, it was a dope week for him. He had some good conversations, some chill time walking and sitting in the couch with fam, and plenty of the usual drugs. Sleep has been bonkers, and he's privileged to give up caring about it. He's been curling up and his experiences have been blurry. Life is good in many critical spots though.
