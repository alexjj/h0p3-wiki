title: 2020.06.25 - Prompted Introspection: Kindergarten

!! Describe one of your teachers.

I've modified the question from [[2019.05.19 - Prompted Introspection: Mosely]]. Clearly, I attempt to describe my teachers in a variety of places on this wiki, and that's even limited to the standard concept of a formal teacher. Despite my attitude and arguments about the state of education and the lack of the pursuit of the truth in my species, I am so grateful to have had teachers. I wish I learned to be my own teacher better, although I tend to be open to learning from anyone (though I set significant constraints on the process), so this could be fairly generic (perhaps even a bit crazy if we are willing to think of inanimate objects as teaching). I'm going to try to stick to the standard concept for now.

Unfortunately, I only remember bits and pieces, not even a face or name in this, just impressions of my kindergarten teacher (I should work my way up). It's hard to remember something three decades ago, back when I was 5. She was gentle. She handled my puke well. She made the classroom fun and inviting. I suppose pleasant spoon-feeding is a fine start for young children; although, obviously, I think school should be a place of incredibly hard work eventually. It was daycare, and I enjoyed being in the midst of lots of people.

I've always been eager to please my teachers, seeking their approval. Being autistic and the BPD/NPD with my donors has warped this process. Too often, my teachers were my parents. I don't know how to thank them for that, and I doubt even half of them would remember me (even though I stick out like a sore thumb). Even if I reach out to them, they won't be able to hear my thanks effectively; it's another incommensurable gap. I feel like I have to rely upon them to just know they merit my thanks even if I can't articulate it.
