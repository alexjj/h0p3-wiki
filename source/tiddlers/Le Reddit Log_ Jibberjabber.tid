My time is worthless, thus Linux is free for [me](https://philosopher.life).

* Imho, you really want an extra computer for this process. You'll want to be able to research on one machine while building the other Linux machine. If you cannot get another large computer (I'm not talking about a phone, no matter how skilled you are on a phone), then you should learn Linux in a virtual machine. Virtual Box is a reasonable starting place.
* Take notes, including saving links, snippets of code, and your thoughts. I suggest Tiddlywiki or plaintext files.
* This should be your first distro: https://manjaro.org/download/. Spend time trying out Plasma, XFCE, and i3. Spend a week with each. Seriously, force yourself to live inside those spaces.
* Go install Arch Linux for the first time, and take the time to understand at least the basics of what you are putting together. Give yourself at least a week just to install it, maybe a month. Take your time. Consider this a Linux From Scratch the EZ way.
* Spend the next few years understanding more about how your computer works. Try things out, including other distros. Read constantly. Keep taking notes.

Currently, I'm trying to invest in migrating from Arch Linux to NixOS. I still feel like a noob, even after 20 years. I think I am a noob. So, take my advice with a grain of salt.

> If your claim is that VPN providers often aren't sufficiently honest, you are correct. Your arguments, however, are flawed.

> 1. Not necessarily true, as it depends on the vulnerability and your attacker. You still wouldn't want a motivated attacker targeting you in particular to be constantly scanning your edge router daily, looking for a vulnerability to eventually present itself.
> 2. Your claim that someone can "ping every ipv4 in an hour" doesn't buy you what you seem to be implying. You'd be surprised what kinds of entities will message your ISP for engaging in this behavior, and it will blacklist IPs. Pinging doesn't identify you in particular, and moreover, it's not an actual scan. In my experience, finding every machine that has port 22 open takes far more than an hour. Deep scanning takes much longer. Trying to brute force takes even more resources, and Zmap is not well-suited to just any kind of attack.
> 3. Some people actually do go straight from their modem to their machine, but most don't these days. More importantly, one device behind that router(s) can endanger them all. Multiple devices do not add security, nor does it necessarily improve your anonymity in all cases. Insecure devices on your network only increase your attack surface, including if they pierce your NAT to run a vulnerable service. 
> 4. Many ISPs assign one IP address, usually rotated on MAC change. 

> You aren't taking surveillance seriously enough. I do not claim that paying for a TUN/TAP forward proxy VPN is the best answer in most cases (far from it), but I think you've some more thinking to do on this topic (as do we all!). If you want to talk about the matter in-depth, [HMU](https://philosopher.life/#Contact%20h0p3) homie.

Why YSK: A lot of VPN Providers scare potential customers that "when your IP gets leaked, you can get hacked, so hide yours". This is not true for a number of reasons.

#If your local network is vulnerable, it will already have been compromised by the time you read this.

#It takes about an hour for a malicious party to scan every public IPv4 Address, which is what "your IP" is. Note that IPv4 Addresses "only" range from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255, not counting several blocks of reserved IPs that will be skipped.

#Your public IP is not your computer, or your phone, it is at worst your home router, and at best a device managed by your apartment complex. In any case, behind "your IP" are multiple devices, which all have built in security measures to protect against most "hacks".

#Because we only have a limited number of IPv4 addresses, your ISP will swap your public IPv4 Address daily, in some cases weekly.

Ultimately Camus’s views are a privileged viewpoint.

Most people are too poor or not free and end up spending the majority of their productive years fulfilling someone else’s passions never having the chance to discover their own.

> I'm a huge fan of [[chameleon]]'s Tiddlywiki (I am her most loyal reader), which is currently undergoing [[reconstruction]]. I like to think of any particular page as being a window, some being more pruned than others. One can stay within pruned, curated, or refined areas of a wiki without exploring the more wild patches. As to the wild parts, I think proper use of search is critical, though most people aren't going to put in the work, in my experience. Also, there are chronologies and streams in her garden, but it doesn't have to be navigated that way.

They've been around a while, but I don't think there's much "theory" about them. They're just personal notebooks where notes are linked by hyperlinks. Digital Zettelkasten is a special kind of PW, which does have some theory behind it.

I suppose I relate to trying to start a zettelkasten, but then just finding I was writing notes for things that weren't really "zettel" ideas (lots of notes on cooking, quotations, notes on my classes (I'm a teacher), etc). And thn realising that's okay and I don't have to follow luhmann's method. If I just want notes with hyperlinks and search, that's fine.

The other thing you might want to look into is "digital garden", which is like a public personal wiki. They're something of an alternative to a personal blog, where your thoughts are presented through linked notes rather than in traditional blog chronological order (there's therefore less pressure to update them on a regular basis or to make every post a self-contained article). The impliciation of "garden" I think is that they can be as "wild" or "pruned" as you like, in terms of how polished and filtered the notes are. You could check out /r/digitalgardens though it's not very active. They're quite fun to browse. A fairly "pruned" one might be https://joelhooks.com/, while more "wild" might be https://wiki.waifu.haus/#Root or its inspiration, https://philosopher.life (I think both of them run on the software tiddlywiki). There are loads more though if you search the phrase.

It was usually a person + a piece of reading that changed me or led me down a path. [Fiction](https://philosopher.life/#Books%3A%20Curated%20Library) has had the highest legibility to impact for me. Unfortunately, and this is in no small part due to my lack of intelligence, the highest impact materials have required encountering many teachers and interpretations. The Bible has been exceptionally instructive in my life, but I am the son of two clergy who focused on the topic considerably during my formative years. Lastly, reading the writing of people I know has been influential to me; though I can't say other people would always benefit from those exact works, I suggest the practice is something they would find radicalizing and a living word in many cases.

Gradual is a method for preventing a large swath of parasitic strategies.

Male Nurse, LPN while in the Army and I had no say where I worked at. So, after working in L&D and postpartum for years...

I've seen and often had to touched so many breasts, vaginas and even anuses on a daily basis that I have lost much of my youthful excitement from seeing a woman's body. Especially, breasts... I initially used to be so afraid to do anything with that and would run to my fellow female nurses when my patients would ask for help with breastfeeding. After a couple of weeks I had a nurse tell me I had to get over it, learn to be comfortable with touching them and treating them for what they are for right now.

So, I dived into learning how to teach breastfeeding. I was so good that the Lactation Nurses told me I the best nurse in the hospital, begged me to take additional classes (which I did do) and to become a Lactation Nurse (which I didn't do). I appreciate the experience but, beasts are all business now. Even my current fiancee occasionally complains on my lack of enthusiasm to her boobs.

She does love my breast massages though but, I'm just doing what I would do to help promote the release of milk to anyone else...🤷🏾‍♂️

As you hay have noticed, the censorship is growing. It's only a matter of time before this subreddit will be banned.

I am writing this representing a group of people building a decentralized Reddit. One one would be able to censor anything because it is distributed between different servers and therefore no party has authority to censor another party.

If you would like to help us by spreading the word or some other means, send me a DM or a comment here.

UPDATE

We are looking for frontend developers. Ideally you need to have experience with Typescript, React, Next.js, HTML and CSS. You don't need to know everything as you can learn everything as you go. Send me a DM if you want to help.

Indexing has driven risk out of stock markets via diversification. Computer analysis has tightened up the EMH. Risk parity has tied stocks to bonds in a rational investment framework. Put these factors together and the main driver of stock prices becomes interest rates.

Essentially, indexes don’t require the same risk premium as individual stocks, but individual stocks are still priced with that premium. Maybe that isn’t a complete answer to you question, but I believe that it’s part of it.

I'm trying to find a way to create a closed network of digital gardens for members of our religious order. I think I have an analogy for how I want this to work (see below) I’m still not sure how to manage it from a technology perspective. Here’s my analogy: there is a large plot of land inside the monastery grounds (private, only the monks have access). As each member in formation progresses to the Novitiate (where a self-directed study is a requirement) they are given an allotment for their garden (to build their own digital garden). They are free to roam around the community gardens, checking out what others are growing and even tasting their produce to see what they want to grow (reading what we have already studied, books read, papers written, etc..). The more experienced digital gardeners share tools (tech support), seeds (ideas to explore), and advice on how to develop their gardens (guidance on developing a course of study) and we all come together regularly to share the bounty of our harvest (Zoom meetings where members make presentations on what they’ve been studying)

We’d need a way to comment on each other’s gardens and maybe link to them from our own. Most of us are non-techy people so it would have to be simple... like Notion or at least let everyone build on whatever platform they feel comfortable with (Google Docs, a blog, Notion, etc...) and they are all linked in a central location.

>This is me: https://philosopher.life/. I spend a lot of time speaking to people on the internet. We can think about the problem together if you wish. I'm doing my best to give you context.

Here's a relatable anecdote: I was in a comments section discussing the story structure of Marvel Movies. In a comment I offhandedly mentioned that Hollywood essentially invented the idea of the happy ending (which is a contestable belief but also not wildly absurd). A guy replies to my comment, disregards most of what I wrote to focus on that sentence, and using multiple expletives and some undercooked logic tells me I'm wrong and asks me what I was thinking. Now, if he was interested in a genuine debate, I'd have been happy to have one, he might even have won. However it's quickly clear his understanding of the subject matter is fundamental at best, and he pays my responses little mind. He responds to me as if my replies are logic puzzles to be solved, like he's trying to revoke my opinion through ontological thinking and sheer force of will - it becomes clear the only purpose of the comment was to angrily insult me and I abandon the conversation. This type of exchange is a very common experience on Reddit. My question, is why?

What exactly is the human motivation for this type of interaction? Is it an opportunity to boost the ego? Does the offending party expect others will agree? Is the passion the result of a perceived injustice? Is it just the release of unrelated frustration in the first mildly acceptable location? It's a phenomenon as old as the internet itself but what exactly is it?

It's not really trolling - at least not in the "class clown" sense that I understand trolling - we're several comments deep on a relatively obscure subreddit, there's no audience, and I'm not personally offended or reactive to his insults. I don't understand the payoff in these types of situations. It feels like he was very sincerely offended by my opinion, yet the subject matter carries little-to-no emotional weight and his knowledge of the subject is very minimal so that doesn't really make sense either.

Is it a result of "hot take culture", which is quick to reward contrarian thinking even if uninformed? I don't believe so because this type of interaction almost never happens in real life. I can't recall a single example of a friend, or even stranger, passionately and angrily disagreeing to an academic idea they themselves have no background in.

The exchange has the structure and passion of a political argument, yet the subject is so banal and irrelevant that the passion behind the argument is confusing. It's hard to imagine the emotion response is actually the result of the comment's content.

Does anyone have insight? I understand this is a bit futile, but it's bizarrely common behavior that I rarely see discussed.

>In a way, my work is perhaps an exemplar of what you don't want (https://philosopher.life). Here is my advice: have two separate systems with no major automation between them.

>Yes, it's convenient to push from Public to Private, but please don't go the other way if you can help it. Even if you only did Public->Private, I think your private information should be something that you'd be willing to accidentally have slip into the public sphere (mistakes and bugs happen, and because you are even asking your excellent questions, you should assume you've only generated a soft and fallible privacy). If you are going to take the additional risk of trying to unify your system, everything must be Private by default, and you should have to purposely tag an object as Public (much like having to confirm that you really do want to run that line of sudoed code in your terminal).

>Any private information that you would want to make public should be done by hand entirely. That's what I do, and I talk (by default) about the things most would never say outloud. All this said, my paranoia runs even deeper; I accept that I may be hacked, and so there is some information that I won't keep on my machines at all. Pay the extra price for your privacy; earn your peace of mind.

For example, I have ADD. I'm pretty open about it. But if someone weren't and wanted to write about their research into their condition in private, how would they manage that in their digital garden?

I imagine that they would mark those notes private in some way, or not publish them. But then they might have some anxiety about accidentally revealing something, and this might have an intellectual chilling effect on their own note practice and research.

In the static site tool I'm building I can mark notes private in the Markdown frontmatter, but my notes are not private by default.

This is a topic I think about often: https://philosopher.life/

It depends on which versions of Rawls and Jesus you have in mind. I'm not a Christian, but I happen to think that Rawls was very lucky to have learned from Saint Jesus (as we all are).

A Heterodox Rawlsian, yes (most Rawlsians I've met lack the fitting political leftism of Saint Jesus, and certainly Rawls was a failure as a human being by comparison). The Golden Rule is at the heart of the Categorical Imperative (about not making an exception of ourselves), and The Original Position is an algorithmic attempt to construct a game-theoretically sound account of the CI distributed across all perspectives available to us (though Rawls does not say it this way). Saint Jesus had one higher principle, and yet even this can be understood in Straussian interpretations of Rawls. What is The Good? Jesus is clearly influenced by Platonism. Non-merely-legal-positivistic Justice requires the collective attempt to decentralize the power of interpreting, discovering, or defining The Good. There are interpretations of Jesus and Rawls that are more than just compatible, but also point to the same essences of normativity and practical wisdom.

Probably an unpopular opinion, but I view this as a success. The true test of a decentralized system is if Nazis and CP can exist on it. If there's some authority that can arbitrarily remove participants, then it's not truly decentralized and there will always be an ongoing moderation power struggle.

So now p2p systems have to shift their thinking: instead of a community banning a person, people will have to ban each other in a p2p sense: I wish to no longer see messages/posts from this particular person. And I view this as desirable. I can't count how many times I've had interesting discussions with people who ended up getting banned from a community for wrongthink or wrongspeak (or I got banned and was unable to continue discussions). P2p breaks this out into person-to-person relationships, which is how it should be.

So, yeah, if you do it right you'll have nazis. And if you do it right, there's no way not to have nazis. But give people good moderation tools and the nazis can be silenced. Also, the more I think about it, the more I realize we really need a comprehensive identity system that ties your physical personhood to an electronic identity, which would make personal moderation much more effective, and could allow trust-based delegated moderation: the ability to honor the blocklists of people I trust.

I'm starting to work on this identity system: https://github.com/stamp-protocol

Thanks. I browsed your site, it's very interesting!

I can see some of the appeal/features of TiddlyWiki, I have a few questions.

- I tend to rework my wiki into 'condensed' information, 'weeding out' superfluous texts and making it more accessible to my future self. How is your experience with that in Tiddlywiki?

- If I understand correctly, you would open multiple TiddlyWiki files for different subjects. Is there some automatic interlinking/directory plugin available?

- The design feels overly packed to me (that's just my personal taste). I like the sleek, spacious layout of something like bear. I'd love to have something that looks like a beautiful TeX rendering ;) - Are there options/examples to get to let's say something like this: https://i.imgur.com/7vOYw4A.png

I am privileged to avoid plenty of the exploitation of capitalists, and as an autistic schizo, I also lack executive functioning that neurotypicals possess. I suggest that routinization in our limbic system is key to allowing us to filter out parts of the world to focus on other things,  and optimizing our processes can be valuable depending on what ends we take up. I suggest one ought attempt to wrestle with morning routines even under utopian communist conditions.

The poor have so much uncertainty in their lives that planning and routinization is not always available or rational in their shoes. This is simply another advantage that capitalists maintain in empathizing with their egos long-term.

I'm an ex-academic researcher. I work on this problem, so feel free to reach out to me. A Straussian interpretation of both will demonstrate not only their compatibility but their need for each other. Though Saint Rawls fails to live up to his own theory (at best, he's a nationalist reactionary who really didn't give a shit about the global poor), he provides a sketch of the mechanism by which to compute an iteratively improved semblance of the Categorical Imperative. It is the grounds for a liquid democracy by which citizens would own the means and ends of power production. Saint Marx fails to offer a foundational moral justification, and here Rawls provides us a reason and method for computing justice for the proletariat. Neither Marx nor Rawls could have understood the practical computing applications and implications (and flaws) of their theories. The Original Position as the legal positivist's criterion of a government can be technically built on Marxist grounds. It is the only way to fairly decentralize power in political dialectics.

>>Let me know if you need any help. I speak with people over my wiki quite a bit.

I don't see the practical appeal of them though (but, I can imagine higher performance computing and VR enabling some fascinating exploration).

[I maintain a public Tiddlywiki](https://philosopher.life), and it handles [Markdown](https://philosopher.life/#Atropos%20Protocol%20Spec%20-%202.0%3A%20Layer%200) well enough for me. I am happy with TW markup for now though (and I've been using it for years). It's a flexible tool.

I work very hard to make my wiki publicly accessible. It's an important problem I speak about at length in the [Readme](https://philosopher.life/#:Readme). 

The default use of Tiddlywiki is privately on your own machine. It's completely self-hosted (and it's also like a [Quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)). You own it, and it even has wiki-wide and tiddler-specific encryption baked in for you to use. It's special in that the basic object is just a single self-compiling HTML file. You control it.

Hi. I don't know if you are interested in what madman has to say. We'll find out. Here's how you do it: 

You build a [radically decentralized platform](https://philosopher.life/#The%20Philosopher%20King) that allows [Humans](https://philosopher.life/#Find%20The%20Others) to pick out who will moderate for them given p2p trust (and proxies built on these) in order to pick out what is [salient](https://philosopher.life/#The%20Good). Build infrastructures in which each person owns their data, including how they shape it ([reminds me of correspondence I have with a manager at FB](https://philosopher.life/#2018.11.29%20-%20JYU%3A%20James%2C%20Y%20U%20No%20Work%20%40%20FB%20Anymore%3F)). When we can actually see each other in largely self-generated contexts, when we speak with our own voices, and when [the workers own the means of production](https://philosopher.life/#Socialism) wherein [capitalism](https://philosopher.life/#Neoliberalism) can't continually squeeze us and exploit how information is constructed, processed, and viewed, we're most likely to have wisdom in general picked out and disseminated.

Yes. It comes with excellent tooling for structuring and restructuring your data. There are plenty of plugins for finding what is salient and connections. It's also easy to search it with any CLI tooling you have available (though I never need to do this).

TW is hackable.

There are rudimentary spreadsheet addons. You could also use TW5-Bob to make an overlay onto an underlying CLI spreadsheet tool. TW can handle images well.

Single-html can still work nicely with files external to it, including images (you could embed, but I don't recommend in most cases). I develop mine with TW5-Bob (based on the nodejs portion of the official TW ecosystem), and it keeps each tiddler in a separate file (it can also separate the tiddler metadata from the contents nicely too). I access that server from other devices on my own network when necessary.

So far, I am satisfied with the manner in which TW scales and fits my infrastructure. I believe it would perform very well even with several hundreds of pages. My wiki is ~60 novels in length, and I still find it very usable.

My own wiki is a confusing, incomprehensible spaghetti of information. I probably have no room to talk here. For all I know, I am part of the problem, lol.

I agree there is some kind of irony in how TW doesn't document itself in TW well-enough. Some version of self-hosting is one of those key paradigms to consider in this space. I am still convinced, however, that TW is a fitting place for organizing and displaying that interactable and searchable information (and even aiding in the evolution of that object). Part of the problem may be that TW (and its community) are still evolving; it's hard to nail down something which isn't set in stone.

I can find examples of TW doing one small task cleanly. It's hard to find good examples of public wikis (of any kind, not just TW) that do it all cleanly though (I would be grateful for any counterexamples). There's also this difference between the arguably arcane and messy programmatic internals of TW (to be expected from FOSS volunteers, even in a community as wonderful as TWs), building the surrounding infrastructures (a larger set of technical problems), and the semantic representation + best practices of using what you are building (which isn't a simple problem in epistemology). I don't know anyone who can do it all extremely well, and that may be required to building a solid course (which may require multiple kinds of literacy).

Brain amplifiers and transformers (and all the other almost paradoxical metaphors I want to use here) are exceptionally hard problems. Emacs might be the only better answer in some contexts (and only if you are wizard with computers, which I am not). I'm growing convinced that I won't find an elegant one-size-fits-all solution.

To my eyes, TW doesn't have enough skilled powerusers cooperating to build something closer to what you asking for. The userbase has not hit that threshold. I don't know if it will. For now, I'm a flawed person stuck using flawed tools with flawed documentation. I'm glad I get to own my wiki; it's often an expensive process.

Unfortunately, the barrier to entry is high and problems like discoverability, safe multi-user environments, and search still aren't easily solved. I don't have any specific alternative I adore either. There's no living platform that meets my preferred requirements.

I'm also interested in tooling that runs well on shitty devices and profoundly [censored, shaped, and inspected] networks, targeting what most of the world has access to. 

>>As has been noted many times in the community, TW lacks an effective course of learning too. It's fragmented in a way that gives no intuitive learning curve (though it is far simpler than anything else like it). I can't build such a thing because I can barely use TW myself.

>Was your implication that you're a TiddlyWiki developer or that you are planning to build a new community?

I'm not convinced that most people will be employed in such a way that they can pay to reasonably live (let alone lead meaningful, flourishing human lives), a price which I predict will continue to rise. I believe the situation is far more dire than unemployment claims can demonstrate. I too hope our crisis will change minds. That is not my prediction, and given how the democratic primaries have been handled (another piece of evidence on a giant heap), my hope is not in current voting processes available to us (though, I consider voting to be the only method to have a morally justified functioning government, and that is what I'm fighting for).

>>I appreciate how level-headed you are for someone your age. I adore computers (though I am not as skilled as you are with them). If you ever want a madman for a friend (I'm like wild-card Charlie from IASIP :P), a crazy penpal even, hit me up. Some of my correspondence lasts for hundreds of pages. It would be my honor to get to know you.

>Honestly, I think that most Americans have become so disillusioned with politics that very few of these things can meaningfully sway them either way.

>The problem with American politics is that for almost two hundred years these people have had a choice between a rock and a hard place, you can only take that for so long before you start realizing that one man will knock out out cold and steal your money while the other will pickpicket it quietly and blame it on someone else. As a result, most Americans - even very politically minded ones - have become apathetic to politics in general, instead choosing to focus on their individual issues. The only remaining people who are left to vote are the die-hards, the bleeding hearts, the ones with too much time and the ones whose hope haven’t been snuffed out yet.

>In America today, we need a major issue to give people hope again that their vote actually matters. My hope is that this virus will do the trick, but honestly I have no idea.

Do you think the unemployment numbers in the US are accurate and good-faith measurements? Do those numbers inform the possible-voting public in a fitting way?

>>>>Thank you for testing! I'm sad that live mapping performance becomes unwieldy. I'll have to think about how I'd want to make predetermined maps. It's cool as hell to see visualizations of it too.

>>> Just tested it and it worked fine! Here's a picture of how the whole screen looked. With this view, the live view updated almost instantaneously. However, if you choose to look at the graph view showing all tiddlers within two nodes distance, it did take a little longer to load the map.

>>> Note that, apart from live view which updates as you move between tiddlers, you can also arrange predetermined graphs. For example, in your case u/4eak, you might want to create a map that introduces new visitors to the wiki. These predetermined maps will load very quickly, regardless of their size.

>>> As to whether it is the right tool for your specific case, that is probably up to you. The bidirectional links worked neatly, the localised live view map works well, and setting up predetermined maps might be nice for certain topics.

>>That is the largest example I have available.

I participate everyday in a group of people who use Tiddlywiki heavily. At least in part, it functions as a social network. We speak from our wikis. It doesn't fit well into the rationalist community (though there are connections). It's not for drive-by readers though (my own wiki is over 30MB of plaintext); it's expensive to engage in the process of reading and writing with each other.

>>>> Also, in case you want to know who you are speaking with, [[this is me|https://philosopher.life/]].

>>> I am against censorship--but am not an absolutist about it. For example, I don't believe people like Alex Jones have the first amendment right to PROFIT off of inciting violence and creating conspiracy theories about murdered school children. I don't have an issue with him being kicked off YouTube and other platforms (he has the right to spew his hate and violence on his own platform). But to me that's where it ends. I don't support YouTube and Facebook and Twitter suppression and demonetization that we have been seeing--nor the widespread f**kery of Google with their ranking schemes. To me, tech companies need to be regulated because they are public utilities....and they need to be regulated by public entities that DO NOT have any financial dealings/donations from them.

>> Do you think Alex Jones has any moral rights to a domain name, a stable IP address, an unNATed internet connection (with no blocked ports), or to have his information packets forwarded (with no difference in priority) by middle internet routers regardless of his profound evil? Do your enemies have a morally justified political right to own a platform which is widely and publically accessible even by people who are not computer savvy, and insofar as an individual cannot own the infrastructure, what (if anything) does society owe him to support his platform?

>> What kinds of regulations do you have in mind? If these are public utilities, should they be privately owned at all? What do you think about the distinction between a publisher and a platform?

> He's not going to answer this as the AMA is over, but you hit the nail on the head.

> Free speech, means all speech. You may not like what the other person says, but they have the right to say it. Authoritarians believe in the opposite.

> The "hate speech" label is increasingly being used in a calculated manner to suppress and censor various types of speech and discussion even for simple disagreements or political views considered "wrong think."

> You see this occurring more and more every day.

> Alex Jones was a trial balloon to test public acceptance/resistance to de-platforming and mass censorship of a public figure. Since this event, you now see Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, and other platforms increasing censorship of all users. i.e. First they came for Alex Jones, but I did not stand up, now they come for me...

It is the centralization of political power in the material dialectic. Owning even the technological means of production is a necessary way out. Unfortunately, it's expensive, there are inefficiencies in decentralization which most people are unwilling to pay for, and the internet on a global scale is something which appears to be controlled by particular nation-states and multi-national corporations which have no desire to empower individuals.

Sometimes you are going to have to kill the sociopath trying to kill you and others. Even The Golden Rule requires turning against your enemy at some point. The root cause of capitalism is egoism, including apathy and an unwillingness to recognize that violence is sometimes the only answer. My real enemy is the capitalist and everyone who enables them. That old lady is far more responsible than you've implied.

I hear ya. Many people find me cynical (I see evil in almost everyone I encounter). I see some of that in your posting history too, so I think we have that in common.

I can agree many are non-trivially responsible to some degree or kind for their circumstances. Generalizing is quite difficult, as you point out. I appreciate that you actually want to care and are willing to think about our moral responsibilities. You are correct: there are leechers, freeriders, sociopaths, and people who deserve their homelessness to some significant extent, but I think looking over the entirety of many of their lives will often show they aren't entirely responsible. Even the victimizers are usually victims at the same time, and I think you've overstated the opportunities available to them. Morally justified upward mobility barely exists for most people; status crystallization or falling is the norm.

You and I have different experiences in this sphere. I have worked with folks of all ages, including homeless children and impoverished persons outside of the US for years. I've seen their faces and heard their stories in many cities and countrysides. The vast majority of homeless people on this planet, including first world nations, are more blameless than your argument implies. I can appreciate being jaded here, but it's worth looking at again and again. If you are interested, I'm willing to engage in a much more significant public conversation with you.

Gah, this would never have happened in ancient Greece. Knowledge is not a bias in the right way, at the right time, for the right reasons. Don't be so close-minded. All possible logically valid inferences and memeplexes are equally salient, and ad hominem attacks are conceptually wrong in both argumentation and selecting authorities. Tribalism is always immoral, and thus discriminating philosophers are the worst kind of scum.

Into infinite regress, fittingly responding to the paradox of tolerance with The Golden Rule and wrestling [[The Other]] with integrity is one of the hard self-defining problems in philosophy.

Of course, it is my honor to [[help]].

I'm sorry you are feeling lost. That's not your fault. It's not designed to be disorienting; it's as organized as I know how to make it. I do not know how to solve that vertigo. To be clear, I am lost too. It is the best tool I have found.

It's really big, currently ~60 (100k-word) novels. It's also heavily fragmented (currently into over 10,000 pieces). Imagine having 10k submitted posts in your sub: https://www.reddit.com/r/Lonewolfeslayer/ on every topic in your life. How would you organize and relate them? It is not an easy problem.

My family and I write in [our wikis](https://philosopher.life/) daily, and it helps with homeschooling quite a bit. Our [family time](https://philosopher.life/#Family%20Time) includes walking as a family and one-on-one time, but our wikis are self-shaped social media, organizational, and personal knowledge base tools for telling the stories of our lives together. 

The barrier to entry into modern capitalism is so fucking high, I'm forced to require my offspring to mechanize, automate, and become adept with leet tools if they are going to have the competitive advantage necessary to survive. It is very hard to be moral in a world in which one's competitors are not trying to be moral. We also build infrastructures and conventions in preparation for us to be able to live meaningful remote lives together because we simply can't see far enough into the future. These survival habits have to begin very early.

The centralization of power (in this case) is only going to be effectively defeated through P2P filtration.

This model has been tried elsewhere, but Reddit has the network effect.

It's good to see this question here. I usually find this kind of learning+productivity porn question in /r/TheMotte and /r/slatestarcodex, and I'm happy to see it in a Leftist sub.

I use Tiddlywiki. I cannot recommend it highly enough. My entire family uses it in place of social media. It's also how my children take their notes and reason about projects for homeschooling. It's extremely hackable, it's a second-brain, and it enables many kinds of autonomy. I didn't discover this tool until after 11 years of post-secondary education, and I'm pretty pissed off about it (it's not quite that old). Better late than never.

I've been using my wiki for almost 3 years now. It's ~30MB of almost pure text in a single file (that's how I prefer to serve it), or ~60 novels in length.

I am free tech support to anyone in this sub who wants to set it up. It would be my privilege to help you own your identity, your data, and how you shape yourself with FOSS power tools. May you own the memes of production.

Yes! It abstracts away a lot of the programming while still giving you access to work under the hood if you want (you may one day decide that is something that you want to do).

You do not need to know how to engineer standard software to build your own wiki. You will need to learn the markup language and play with settings, but if you can do markup on Reddit, you can do it on the wiki. I suggest using Firefox with the saving extension or the Bob executable (both are excellent options). There are many learning curves to using a wiki, and only some of them are technical. I think you will do great, and if you get stuck: you can always ask me or anyone on the forums.
<<<

<<<
The Firefox method is the simplest, and in my experience, it is also the most performant (though I hold a minority view on this one). I used it for years, even with multiple devices (I use Resilio Sync to synchronize files across my devices). My wife still uses it too, but the rest of my family has moved onto Bob. Do not forget to install the savetrail plugin (it has saved my ass so many times), and I also highly recommend you take a nightly snapshot of your wiki (you may want to rollback or reason about the evolution of your wiki).
