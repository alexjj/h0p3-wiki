I am sure your busy, just wanted to let you know I got the money. Paid all all my bills off that I needed to( what I owed to gage). Paid what I owed for the rent and will be ready to sign the lease over.  Going to buying my ticket, I  am deciding if I want to take a flight instead  of the greyhound
Jan 20 6:24pm
$80 price difference
Jan 20 6:24pm
Awesome! =)

Sweet,Thank you.
Jan 20 7:57pm

Failed to send last night: I'm excited to be immediate, in-person family with you. I am a very lucky person to be able to live with those I love the most. It's my pleasure and my honor to be your brother, and it means more than I know how to say that you trust us and love us.
Jan 21 7:02am
It won't be till after the 25th. I am trying to fly out on the 26th.  Mikayla, Lindsey, gage and a few others are doing a small family  goodbye dinner.
Jan 21 12:07pm
This made me cry happy tears. The funny thing to this is I just said something very similar  to [[JRE]]. I feel like I did a poor job of it, but [[JRE]] showed a lot of trust and faith in me, and I am so grateful to him and for everything  he has done and the sacrifices he has made to help me get through the the darkest parts of my life and has helped me get the help and love that I needed.  
I love you both so much and am so excited, happy, sad and scared but mostly  the first two. Lol. 
I also used the word honoured with Mikayla  the other day. She gives me hope for the world.  she gives me an ear when I need to talk  to. She helps me to have more  empathy for others and reminds me to love myself, to know I am not less than dirt, that what my mind will sometimes  say to me is not right and that I am worthy of love .
Jan 21 12:56pm
You awake?
Jan 21 8:48pm

Jan 26 3:35pm
what's up?
Jan 26 3:35pm
The apartment  management  said they just now received  Nike(person replacing me on the lease).  I know this is not true gage and I both saw the multiple emails and phone calls to them by Nick.  I just called them and they said they got it but they are very busy today and will do there best to get to it in the next day or so!!! WTF!!
Jan 26 3:37pm
That sucks.
Jan 26 3:38pm
What are the consequences?
Jan 26 3:38pm
How fucking hard is it for me to go down with just gage and I and sign me off the lease.
Jan 26 3:38pm
I feel like they are pussy footing around. 

And the consequences  is it just takes longer.
Jan 26 3:39pm
Yeah, they probably are giving you the run around.
Jan 26 3:40pm
=/
Jan 26 3:40pm
That sucks, dude.
Jan 26 3:40pm
Sorry.
Jan 26 3:40pm
Fuck it. I was invited to a bonfire tonight sonim gonna go and enjoy the rest of my day. 

People wasting my time. Assholes. 
Also I didn't smoke yet so I'm gonna  go do that now  because its not like I waited all fucking day to do so because I wanted to make sure I was sober and not high so I can make sure I understand  what I will be signing... fuck people
Jan 26 3:45pm

I might not eat to be honest.  My stomach is feeling crappie from the flights and a lack of sleep. Lol I haven't slept for almost 48 hours. My anxiety  has been through the roof.
Jan 28 3:27pm
