It's good to see you, sir. I'm curious about what brought you back to typing on Reddit [[recent]]ly. If you are interested, do you have a place on one of your sites that would be fitting for me to check for responses? What do you think about that claim that caught your eye, "No piece of information is superior to any other. [[Power]] lies in having them all on file and then finding the connections. There are always connections; you have only to want to find them."?

The experts and gurus I trust believe [[the future of TW|https://boffosocko.com/2020/03/22/23-2019-06-25-twggf-the-future-of-large-tiddlywikis-h0p3/]] is bright; they have not appeared nearly as concerned as I have been. I take it my pessimistic worry is likely unworthy because I am not sufficiently competent with this tool. Poorly, I'm trying to commit myself further to idiomatic TW usage. I suspect you could acquire mastery of it and see why they are likely correct (even if I don't see why).
