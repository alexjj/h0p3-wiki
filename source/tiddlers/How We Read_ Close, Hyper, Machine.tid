title: How We Read: Close, Hyper, Machine

//Haha...Just saw your wiki update come up. Made me smile.//

https://www.ade.mla.org/content/download/7915/225678

My god, this is a well-chosen document for me (and us). Yes, ma'am. Thank you. `/salute`. I'm afraid I won't be able to do it justice. You stuck a quarter in me, [[Root User]]. I keep encountering this argument. Deja vu. 

What I've written is too long and unfinished, and I don't ask you to read it unless you are truly bored (it's not nearly as well prepared as the article you handed me). It might not be relevant enough for you. I don't know. I'm glad you had me think about it though.

I have an adversarial approach (condescension is how I earn a beautiful ass kicking...I learn through the school of hardknocks too often), even when I'm largely in agreement and even admiration. You get my unrefined first-pass gut instinct rambling gibberish, as usual. XD.

The crucial questions are these: how to convert the increased digital reading into
increased reading ability and how to make effective bridges between digital reading
and the literacy traditionally associated with print.
<<<

Yeah, we are probably conditioned to read differently on a screen, though it's not clear that it necessarily must be so. I'm less likely to focus on a single object within a turing machine that has other candy to taste. e-Reader natives might not see a serious difference, I don't know (but maybe we shouldn't call that digital reading). Locking ourselves out of temptation is not a great answer.

Surely there are other crucial questions to consider. The ability to find what is salient on an optimal path [[infinigress]]es (and faces the halting problem). Hyperreading's strength of breadth is not easy to measure either. I can construct exams for [[Deep Reading]] regurgitation, analysis, and synthesis, but I'm not sure how to test for reference and exploration skills. What counts as relevant information for our context? I don't trust any academics to pick that out wisely enough, and that's the real issue at stake, even in reading. 

What ought one do with the postmodern flood of information? It begins to flatten everything. The amount of information required to be a functioning citizen today is wildly higher than 100 years ago. It might be the case that younger generations are actually far more aware of reality and more competent than older generations in the broader scheme of things (especially if younger generation face higher pressures). 

All this said, even IQs may be falling in the developed world. Perhaps the problem extends much further than reading.

<<<
Students read incessantly in digital media and write in it as well, but only infrequently are they encouraged to do so in literature classes or in environments that encourage the transfer
of print reading abilities to digital and vice versa. The two tracks, print and digital, run side by side, but messages from either track do not leap across to the other side.
<<<

A lot of digital reading skills are embedded in the interface and in one's search-fu (and even those skills are constantly in flux in an evolving landscape). It's a different beast. It's fair to say they are different kinds of text in many cases. Show and define for me expert digital authorship (it's not so easy). This craft is brand-spanking new. We don't have generations of academics who have honed the topic either (in fact, the digital illiteracy of the academics I know scares the fuck out of me). We've had thousands of years to attempt to congeal codex conventions. Shouldn't one predict this asymmetry? Will time heal this wound?

<<<
This expansion into diverse textual realms meant that literature was no longer the de facto center of the field. Faced with the loss of this traditional center, literary scholars found a replacement in close reading, the one thing virtually all literary scholars know how to do well and agree is important. 
<<<

I'm worried I can't satisfactorily define //close reading//. That may easily be my own incompetence. 

It's also harder and harder to build a canon of memes and references that we share in common, and, in a way, the interwebs is racing for that (cross-culturally, globally too). That is fundamental to literacy of all kinds. Skilled contemporary close reading surely is going to have to include hyperreading skills necessarily "get" references (and counterpoints) to plug'n'play in order to interpret.

<<<
Literary scholars generally think they know what is meant by close reading, but, looked at more closely, it proves not so easy to define or exemplify. 
<<<

Speak of the devil. Also, I love this "closely" about "closeliness" concern. What is close-perceiving? Is that autistic in some respect? 

<<<
close reading is our contemporary term for a heterogeneous and largely unorganized set of practices and assumptions

That is a sexy word. y u m. 

<<<
a dichotomy between the close reading recognizable to most literary scholars—detailed and precise attention to rhetoric, style, language choice, and so forth through a word-by-word examination of a text’s linguistic techniques—to the digital world of fast reading and sporadic sampling
<<<

So few words from so few people are worth our close, sustained attention, or so it seems. I daresay plenty don't believe in the value of taking anything that seriously. Of what use is it to us these pomo egoistic days? Why be that charitable? What fruit do I want my attention to bear, and why not just go for the endless low-hanging variety? What is productive for me in capitalism? Who the fuck has time to read so closely any more, especially when just keeping up with the present is an impossible task. Other narratives push our pleasure buttons more price-efficiently too. 

Perhaps there may still be unobvious sampling methods going on in even what one might call close-reading. We hunt for what sticks out. 

<<<
the text is an alibi for ideological formations that are subtextual. The heroic task of the critic is to wrench a text’s ideology into the light
<<<

I agree that extremely close reading and writing are engaged in this process of uncovering the subconscious processes in us. We can't afford to lose this skill. At least at face value, hyperreading, which includes having access to what dozens (or even thousands) of other rated commenters are saying real-time about some objects, provides immediate context and uncovering. As an epic freerider: the context (including something as stupid as the domain name) does a lot of work for me, and my job begins to turn into one of verification and curation (though, I don't think this subtext interpretation task ever ends). 

I'm willing to accept gnostic approaches (though not unmitigated ones) to texts. I think extremely short texts on the interwebs, like tweets, do receive significant scrutiny (and paranoid clue-seeking) often enough. QAnon cults are a great example too. Sustained close-reading of long-form text might be down, but the ability to leverage others' work in this task is up.

Reminds me of this kid who never read any of the books or primary sources (and, I think most primary sources are fucking abominations). He just googled that shit and he knew when he didn't know enough, and he knew when he knew enough. 

<<<
incompatibilities between what a text says and what it does
<<<

I am, again, hawt for teacher.

<<<
Literary studies has been slow to address these possibilities, however, because it continues to view close reading of print texts as the field’s essence. As long as this belief holds sway, digital reading will at best be seen as peripheral to our concerns, pushed to the margins as not “really” reading or at least not compelling or interesting reading.
<<<

One funeral at a time...

Those fucking plebs!!! How dare they encroach!? Please, someone show me how to connect to the printer, and who is this 4chan?

I've heard some say this gap is incommensurable (even if only for incentivization problems). I'm not so convinced (but, hey, I'm not going to be an academic). There are already fields in which the cutting edge scholarship is exclusively to be found in online dumpsters.

While I remain impressed by the specialized work of many academics, I'm terrified when I see their generalist skills/knowledge. Close-reading often has a kind of myopic parallel problem in it too. It's kinda shocking to me how many times I run into 25yos whose opinions about what matters in the world I hold in higher regard than most 50yos too. It gives me [[hope]].

<<<
if the distance is too great between what one wants someone else to learn and
where instruction begins, the teaching will not be effective. Imagine, for example, trying to explain Hamlet to a three-year-old (an endless string of “Why?” would no doubt result, the all-purpose response of young children to the mysterious workings of the adult world)
<<<

I find most people are egregiously mistaken about what is feasible, let alone what is possible.

This is exactly what we are supposed to be doing with 3yos. Growing comfortable learning while only understanding 20% is a key skill too, and appreciating reiteration and how it grows our models becomes even clearer to the student here. You will sometimes strike oil and gold with these risks. There's something exceptionally rewarding about this kind of wandering. And, I think it significantly helps us become better predictors/anticipators of future arguments or pathing. Anecdote Trigger Warning: I've seen a 7yo whoopin' ass of plenty adults in philosophy classes, and sometimes only in virtue of knowing which questions to ask. [[ridtyawtr]]. I say we suck Feynman's dick (Saint Aristotle's too) and shoot for the fucking stars here.

<<<
 for learning to occur, the distance between instruction and available skills must

In order to cross a bridge, you need be able cross a bridge. Deep. I am glad we crossed this bridge.

<<<
Bauerlein instances many responses from young people as they encounter difficult print texts to the effect the works are “boring” or not worth the trouble. How can we convey to such students the deep engagement we feel with challenging literary texts? 
<<<

Oh, well, I worked not to give as much of a fuck about their feelings here (though I strongly prefer positive feelings). ''You will try!'' My son speaks and reads through sheer force. As I lose authority though, that doesn't work so well. Have I implanted curiosity and first-hand, lived experience of the value of (and obligation for) deep engagement? Probably. At some point it's just not up to me though.

What's a better predictor of whether or not a child will enjoy reading than having been read to as a child? Having parents who consistently read. Monkey see, monkey do, maybe. Or, the problem of as I say, not as I do. Does the household tend to value it? Assuming you even want to connect with me (I am an asshole), are you going to be able to connect with me at the dinner table if don't engage in this behavior? Are you going to get in trouble for not trying? Are the highlights of our days based on facing these challenges together?

Okay, brand new, never before offered critique: it's the fucking Boomers. That's my favorite scapegoat. I'm not going to hear any other option now. They did this.

Who has time to be a fucking parent? Why should we think our ~~schools~~ daycare prison systems should work?

<<<
hyperreading...reader-directed, screen-based, computer-assisted reading...search queries...filtering...skimming, hyperlinking, “pecking” (pulling out a few items from a longer text), and fragmenting...juxtaposing, as when several open windows allow one to read across several texts, and scanning...to identify items of interest. 
<<<

Those are more crucial to hyperreading than deepreading. Setting aside the digitization, those have never been exclusive to hyperreading. Every single one of those skills is crucial to deep reading even a codex. I submit that [[Straussian]] interpretations (which are as close as one can get to a text, in my experience) may even rely upon these skills even more than the usual close reading. Hrm. 

What I take to be most productive or valuable about the process changes, however, when I have computer-assisted perception of [[The Great Human Conversation]]. 

I, of course, always think our wikis are, like, jus da bes. I think this is one of the most exciting parts of the our wikis. It's not that we can't do what we do on paper to a significant degree, but the convenience affords us a great deal. Unlike the codex (or even a standard linear blog), our objects were designed with hyperreading as first-class modes. We celebrate and leverage ergodicity. It's not a parlor trick or merely fine art that one eisegetically close-reads; it's functionally different. The objects mold around both the author and the reader who can rely upon higher complexity and layering in the communications channel (and there's probably something emergent there). 

I can't [[share]] who I am fast enough in person (no one has the energy for that either). I don't know what someone does or doesn't know well enough. In a way, reader-directed exploration unburdens me as an author and it [[ltf]] (or increases it, if one is prone to add very important abbreviations). Even this text you've picked out for me to read and think about might be in virtue of our [[hyperconversation]] (perhaps even what was said just a few lines above the link). 

Hyperreading encourages associative, schizophrenic abuses of our pattern recognition. Hyperreading might maximize our autonomy (and hence our responsibility) in interpretation in many respects too.

Yet, looking through our logs, it's detail-oriented. It is the rhetoric, the small things, the footnotes, the hidden crevices and reading between the lines, the moth languages, the emoji, the playing with colors and effects, as well as the raw nitty-gritty of what we're thinking that is show-cased. 

What I'm saying is, our wikis are amazing, big-brained piles, and Hayles would surely agree.

a physical device invented in the Renaissance to cope
with the information explosion when the number of books increased exponentially
with the advent of print. Resembling a five-foot-high Ferris wheel, the book wheel
held several books on different shelves and could be spun around to make different
texts accessible, in a predigital print version of hyperreading
<<<

Recently saw one of these terrible devices in a meme. Further, this "cope" word seems to be a meme on fire. Hyperreading is coping. I'm drowning in memes.

<<<
Yet hyperreading may not
sit easily alongside close reading. Recent studies indicate that hyperreading not only
requires different reading strategies than close reading but also may be involved with
changes in brain architecture that makes close reading more difficult to achieve
<<<

Yeah, yeah, sounds about right. But, ouch, this one kicks me in the nuts (and [[kicks]] has mentioned this before, ofc). Looking the other direction: hyperwriting and closewriting (or deepwriting), these are things, right? The wiki tempts me not to engage in deepwriting. The "it's good enough"<<footnote "l" "Random aside: can a version of the Lockean proviso fit here?">>. It can be wandered and searched. I don't know what I need right now, but I have enough breadcrumbs to likely find it if I really wanted to find it. Do I actively encourage myself to deepwrite from my hyperwriting? Not so much. Yeah, it definitely encourages more hyperwriting, lol, and that's not nothing. I've kinda stopped gardening. It feels like it's taking everything I have to just cope, and I'm perhaps foolishly hoping I'll just blindly stumble upon what I need. I don't have the balance I want.

Part of the problem is that the scope of our work is practically an entire universe from our perspectives. If I'm being arguably too charitable with myself, just even hyperwriting about it is difficult enough that we might call it sufficient. I feel like I should know better. Who doesn't want to lower the bar for themselves? lol. That's part of what I've been doing as I'm curling up. <3. (^^Hey, you, `/poke` I'm [[sharing]] with you. (ofc, [[WINTCIS]])^^)

<<<
 hyperreading leads to
changes in brain function that make sustained concentration more difficult
<<<

Or, hyperreading tends to beget more hyperreading (just as hyperwriting tends to beget more hyperwriting). 

Of course, I will take every word this author writes absolutely personally, like an decent narcissist. I hyperread for many hours each day, and it takes plenty of sustained concentration. Concentration on what? On my next dopamine hit? Sure. There is so much candy to be had. Distraction from what, god damnit!? [[gfwiwcgws]]. 

You know I'm an insane person. I'm hunting for an answer to capitalism qua [[The Right]]. I am a delusional guerilla neckbeard keyboard warrior. It's not a problem that one person can answer, but it's the kind of problem that requires lots of people to approach as though one person will have the answer (or to at least understand the nature of that beast).

What do I think is [[good]] for [[Humanity]], and what do I think [[Humanity]] is [[good]] for? I am throwing everything I have at it like a madman. If life is a video game, this is still the most strategic character build I've got to fight the beast. Concentration on a telos, that I feel like I've done well. Finding the fitting path and instruments, probably not. 

<<<
Several studies have shown that, contrary to the
claims of early hypertext enthusiasts such as George Landow, hyperlinks tend to
degrade comprehension rather than enhance it...As the number of links increased, comprehension declined, as measured by
writing a summary and completing a multiple-choice test.
<<<

I'm not shocked that we see declines on those comprehension tests. Links are noisy. 

<<<
increased demands of
decision-making and visual processing in hypertext impaired reading performance
<<<

Bingo. Yet, that price is worth paying in broader contexts! There's so much more to long-term comprehension than can be measured by that kind of testing. 

Let us divide perception from comprehension here. Hyperreading grants exposure, an initial kernel, a survey of the land, a chance to place a smaller context into a much broader one. Hyperreading cultivates fastmind perception, and that is necessary even if insufficient for justification and comprehension.

What does this small thing mean? Well, if I only concentrate on it with what I have in linear fashion, I'm sure I'll more quickly develop an awareness of it, in some respects, by eliminating the noise between me and it. But, what that small thing really means is often best understood in terms of the world, a proper hyperobject that can only be perceived but not comprehended at some point. There's no escaping the hyperreading problem.

Without a doubt, hypertext has enabled me to understand the world in a way that pure linear reading could not (and, I question what even consists in linear reading at some point). Hyperreading is about sensing. That is at least half the empiricist's equation. 

Fuck. I don't even know how to define reading at this level.

At what difficulty do I need to enter the present-at-hand mode to consciously attempt to convert interpretations of symbols into semantics? That's what the author is after here, right? The goal is to effortlessly, ready-to-hand interpret, for it flow into my fastmind without interruption or pauses. That is ideally virtuous reading, presumably, at the very least, a very significant portion of it. 

<<<
Why should hypertext and Web reading in general lead to poorer comprehension? 
<<<

That's like asking why higher entropy information states should lead to slower or poorer computation. It's like asking why knowledge is more difficult to achieve in postmodern conditions. Boost my sensations too high, and I will be autistically drowned, overwhelmed, unable to predict or trust anything with confidence. 

It's also, as I've pointed, out, not necessarily true. You are going to have speak about how to measure comprehension. [[gfwiwcgws]] and comprehension of what? We'll be tempted to simply think of it as a potential, but that would be missing the point. I will continue to argue that younger generations understand the world better than older generations, and that is in no small part due to hyperreading and its many ripple effects in us a social nodes. 

Sure, I can hand plenty of folks a piece of paper where they can play a language game with me that demonstrates they understand the relationship of the symbols with accuracy in a given time frame, but that potential does not entail all that much about their knowledge, nor particularly knowledge of what actually matters. What do these symbols mean? The answer rests upon and points toward [[The Infinite]]. Why? 

So, let me grant that there are tradeoffs here. There are contexts in which hyperreading costs us comprehension. No doubt. It's just far less cut and dry than what a simple test can evaluate though.

<<<
The answer, Carr believes, lies in the relation of working memory (i.e., the contents
of consciousness) to long-term memory...For retention of more
complex matters, the contents of working memory must be transferred to long-term
memory, preferably with repetitions to facilitate the integration of the new material
with existing knowledge schemas. The small distractions involved with hypertext
and Web reading—clicking on links, navigating a page, scrolling down or up, and
so on—increase the cognitive load on working memory and thereby reduce the
amount of new material it can hold. With linear reading, by contrast, the cognitive
load is at a minimum, precisely because eye movements are more routine and fewer
decisions need to be made about how to read the material and in what order.
<<<

Hrm. I suggest the contents of consciousness extends beyond the kind of working memory directed by our ray of intentionality.

This all sounds in reasonable order to me. I'll point out that deliberate spaced repetition over hypertext is more functional! Moreover, I suggest that highly-practiced hyperreaders will not experience nearly as much cognitive load; I could imagine cases in which one would be even more practiced with hypertext (and I'm willing to be radically broad here: I'm not sure what on a computer screen doesn't count as hypertext) than codex by such a wide margin that we could see a flip. 

There's a huge difference between someone who has made their [[monster]] an extension of themselves and someone who is actively aware (through frustration) that their machine is separate in their [[Embodied Cognition]]. High degrees of familiarity with hypertext will allow one to filter out the noise more effectively too (some people think my screen is crazy when they see it, and others find it to be just fine). There are lots of little things that can add up. e.g. I use extensions to profoundly accelerate my mouse for scrolling, and I don't think even about it (some people are surprised by it in the same way that competent typing surprises them). It's a lot like controlling a character on the screen, especially if you've never mastered controlling one before; there's an empathy to it in spatial reasoning (and, indeed, our spatial reasoning forms the foundation for our ability to generate theories of mind of other beings that we project to possibly be embodied like us). My [[arrogant]] opinion is that most people are computer illiterate in this way (and, in plenty of contexts, I am too!). Hyperreading while one is "in the zone" or flowstate might be at least somewhere in the ballpark of the effectiveness of focusing in practiced linear reading. 

Now, this issue of memory is something that a practiced student knows how to improve upon. I find writing to be a crucial tool for proper reading (that's what I'm doing right now ;P). Long, long ago, before I had spent so much time on my machines, I found writing by hand and marking on my reading materials to be far superior to similar notetaking on my machines. That has been changing though, and I suggest that my offspring who have been raised more effectively with computers (though I do not suggest proficiently enough to my eyes; I'm not an expert enough to teach it well from the beginning) tend to benefit more from writing on their machines than in their notebooks for the sake of memory (and other qualities).

Of course, in at least some cases, I don't need to fully know the information, I just need to know how to find it. This is where hyperwriting and hyperreading takes off, wildly. As a matter of cognitive load, far more information can be findably organized this way. What is my memory? Well, I've got some pointers or fuzzy pointers that help me arrive at some address external to my brain; I often know enough about the contents of this address to know I'm looking for it and why to some [[dok]]. Barring that, I might have vague awareness or a prediction that might be able to find such a needle in the haystack. Practicing these kinds of habits with hyperwriting and hyperreading seem to be crucial, and I suggest most of us are just now coming to grips with the implications of our devices as extensions of ourselves in this sense as well. Note, I am worried about how capitalism will influence this bridge, and I recommend building it by hand, as usual.

<<<
Current evidence suggests that we are now in a new phase of the dance between
epigenetic changes in brain function and the evolution of new reading and writing
modalities on the Web
<<<

`/nod`

It is not easy to guess the potential here. Even just conditioning of these neural pathways isn't well understood. There's probably a huge difference between a random 21st century kid and one trained for it (probably 2 standard deviations if trained by a master). I remain hopeful that the wikis are a useful step for my offspring here too. They have some decent initial kernels to bootstrap from (my son has come such a very, very long way in the desert...//About//:[[1uxb0x]], I'm glad to say, is not accurate enough anymore). They have stronger naming space conventions, explicit models for dialectical conceptual analysis, a clearer sense of the interconnectedness of their beliefs and desires, formal distinctions about syntax/semantics or maps/territories, [[FO]] Logic, basic set and category theory, (imho) extremely strong theories of their own minds, a significant amount of practice writing and reading simple hypertext for a number of different kinds of problems (hooking them up to [[The Matrix]] to free their minds, ofc).

I am worried they don't read enough codex though. Super fucking worried. I've had to make judgment calls. There is only so much I can force them to do. I'm still convinced their best option is to be a computer toucher, a code monkey, and lawd willing, wizards (though the special time has passed).


---

Thus far, my conclusion is that I've not said anything new here, but that's okay. I'm spinning my wheels, trapped in a closed-loop maybe. A daoist would argue I should just go with the flow, but this has kinda become my frenetic flow.
