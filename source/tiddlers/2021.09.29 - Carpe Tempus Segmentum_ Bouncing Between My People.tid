title: 2021.09.29 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Bouncing Between My People

[[5c0ut]] chilled with me downstairs. Thunder. [[ASK]]ing. She's doing much better. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]] + [[ASK]]ing + LEC finals. Sleep by unknown time. 

Woke at 10? It was good sleep (my goal is to vampirically drain sleep from everyone in my life so that I can sleep well; it's working). Fireman Time! [[ASK]]ing. [[TTTOTW]].

Pitter-patter, light showers.

//The Walk// with my offspring was pleasant, and we left much earlier than usual. Vapelyfe. She didn't do her work. =/. My card was handed to me. Okay, human. My son carried the conversation quite a bit, and we argued about patterns and prediction. I gave my usual spiel about the problems of positivism, nominalism, pure empiricism, etc. We took a longer route this time because of some very loud construction (we really don't like sound this loud).

Shopping @ Home Depot with the offspring. We looked for fridges, but they were too expensive, imho. Amazon it is. Considered insulation again, but they lack what we need in bulk. Nothing to buy, but that's okay. We made more use of it. It was a field trip, of sorts, as we walked down every single aisle together. We'll need to do it again, and I wish I had more expertise to talk about everything there. 

Assignments. A dadnap hit me like a Mac truck. At least an hour, while she was at her last session.

//Raw Skintime//. She got a t-shirt (and I'd argue she was even unsatisfied by what PT generated after all, but that's exactly when you would get a t-shirt). No more spoons left in her.<<ref "p">> Class was gucci, and like any decent student, the professor is starting to elevate her and throw curveballs they wouldn't throw at the other students, make her work for it (with a smirk<<ref "g">>). She finally got something wrong, :P. 

!! L o s e r ‼️

She's terrible at this, and clearly, she'll never be good at it or amount to anything. Should probably give up now, especially before they all figure out that she doesn't belong there. I've been teasing her about her midterm pretty relentlessly (trying to break the actual anxiety*). Also, her compliance policy (she was required to make on behalf of her boss' boss), a document yet again whipped up on the spot, is now going to reach all 3 veeps (different channels, it seems). What her branch does is arguably better than the main's too. An odd meeting with CH and J concerning book transport, and it appears someone overstepped in making their claim (not our circus, not our monkeys, and no reason to put a dog in the fight either, etc., etc.). SZ has yet again confirmed our [[bias]] on J (so diplomatic), and I can see why she wasn't able to say anything before the pairing. Letters of recommendation won't be difficult to acquire anyway. Continued Greek confirmed yet again, and SZ say it's a wise timetable. Assisted Fireman Time!

[[Family Gathering]]. My offspring made sketti with a meaty red sauce and a salad with more variety than usual (`/squint`, I'm surprised by my son, though I am glad, =D). We talked a bit before the show began. It was the Sexually Kissing A Consenting and Dying 9yo Isn't Necessarily Pedophilia episode of //House//. Imho, this is the best season of the show, as the antagonist I'm most moved by is upcoming (didn't mention it, as my daughter is already hot on the trail in her character analysis). Of course, my daughter was hooked on arguing with the show's wrestling with the definition and possibility of courage; I thought she was going to go on a rant about this virtue, XD (she's gonna be bored when we hit Saint Aristotle's NE in earnest<<ref "a">>).  

Attempted sleep. Fail. XOXOs. [[TTTOTW]]. [[ASK]]ing. The test was quick.
