title: 2020.12.25 - Prompted Introspection: My Gender Identity

!! When you introspect, away from society and your physical body, deep inside, do you feel a sense of gender?

Insofar as that is even a coherent question, I barely care.<<ref "m">> `/shrug`. Like any reasonable person at the turn of the millennium, I do have strong opinions about the question though. I have had to answer many moronic [[prompt]]s; I think this question is often a red<<ref "a">> herring tribal sorter, a convenient neoliberalized identitarian distraction from the problem of capitalism (do you want to talk about the constructs of market forces here?), sometimes a method for people to pose as victimized-heroes-of-their-own-stories or to vacuously virtue-signal in supposed self-exploration, and it's not worth wasting my time shredding it.<<ref "i">> The question is a poor one, at best. There are better metrics, frameworks, and predicates to describe us. Further, I have little respect for postmodern constructivism, unbridled individualism, purely subjective self-identification, and unjustified^^tm^^ attempts at forcing others to confirm your confabulated self-image (or silencing them otherwise). Wake the fuck up. Though maxims require context (I'm no blank slate, and I must engage in the stoic's work of determining what is not up to me in my [[embodied cognition]]), I'm a person, and my choices are what really contribute to defining who I am in the way that matters. You want me to reduce<<ref "r">> myself to a satisfactory self-identified label: I'm a moral agent (that's where my dignity comes from: that's why we are equals at a crucial level). Whatever gender that is (Dasein?), call me that if you want.<<ref "w">> Assuming you haven't, Samwise, only after you concede that about us will I move on. Without that foundation, this question is pointless discrimination or mere narcissistic aesthetic.

<<footnotes "m" "Some consider my autism to be a demonstration of a hypermale brain, and maybe that's true, but I [[aim]] not to give a fuck about morally arbitrary characteristics or such weak predicates or ambiguous labels more than I ought. Fine, I'll speak in these terms when I must, because it quickly and price-efficiently adds something to the story for our predictive modeling/interpretation. Yeah, I feel like myself pretty often, and among the spectrum(s) of gender, I consistently partake of the essential form of maleness (`/gestures to some definition`) in various modes to some significant degree in most contexts. Very well then. So while it's not completely irrelevant, it's wildly lacking in value.">>

<<footnotes "i" "I don't think you even know what you are trying to ask, Samwise.">>

<<footnotes "r" "And, I don't consider //reduction// to be conceptually unacceptable. That's what practical intelligence does in abstracting, learning, and modeling. It's reasonable to ask for [[salient]] compression of representations of what is and what ought.">>

<<footnotes "w" "//Post-post-post-Woketard// has a pleasant ring to it. I'm, like, so over it, person.">>
