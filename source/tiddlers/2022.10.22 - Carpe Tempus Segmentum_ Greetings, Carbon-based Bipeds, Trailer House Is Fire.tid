title: 2022.10.22 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Greetings, Carbon-based Bipeds, Trailer House Is Fire

Put mi amor to bed. Surprised she's up this late. Cannot sleep. Let [[5c0ut]] know there was pudding (he knew). Brix. [[TTTOTW]] + //This Is How You Lose the Time War//. Fail. //Children of Time//. Lasted long before I stopped. I think I'm looking for something more personal and existential, but I am always scouring. Books are no substitute for people, or at least it is not easy to write such a thing. =). // Childhood's End//, surely still relevant and by the grandmaster himself. Made it through 20% of the book. Perhaps, I am not choosing books wisely enough. [[TTTOTW]]. //The Patient//. Noice. Smashing through hundreds of tabs too. =). Sleep by 6?

Woke at 2. Lol. //Skintime// + //Alphabet of Thorn// with my sympaticon. Hugs'n'bugs. [[TTTOTW]]. 

Cannot get [[this Trailer House|https://youtube.com/watch?v=8J2CBwQlNv8]] out muh brain. It's insane. I hope they do everything from my childhood this way. Do it! //Traumazone// + [[TTTOTW]].

Shopping @ Costco with mi amor. Pizza, Dialectics. Grabbed warm clothes for folks. Gonna be a cold winter, especially since we will minimize how much we heat the house. Hygiene objects. Heads up: no Mama Tom Yum noodles. Glad we bought a bunch. Enjoying the treat while we have it, ofc.

Chat with [[5c0ut]]. Bronchitis. People are getting chewed out by higher ups for not providing lead time and papertrails. Dope. Hugs'n'bugs with folks. 

Shopping @ W-Entity with my sympaticon. Some food stuffs, cleaning supplies, toilet paper (we ran out, and I still can't convince others to use the bidet).

Egg nog, meat, bread, LoL Worlds with my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]]. Sleep by 8.

Woke at 11:30. Yus. [[TTTOTW]].
