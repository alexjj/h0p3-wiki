; 1287-1347: William of Ockham

* There is such a thing as necessity in logic but not in the natural order of things.
* We cannot learn more about the world purely through logical argument; we must first observe.
* The more complicated explanation is more likely to have something wrong with it.
* We should always assume the minimum we need to assume in an explanation; entities should not be posited unnecessarily.
