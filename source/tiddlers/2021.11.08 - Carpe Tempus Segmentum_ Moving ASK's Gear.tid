title: 2021.11.08 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Moving ASK's Gear

<<<
Woke at 9? Hard sleep. Fireman Time! //Skintime// with [[ASK]]. We got breakfast: jerky, apples, and a bagel with cream cheese for me. //Skintime// + LolWorlds Finals + Food + [[TTTOTW]].

//Skintime// with mi amor as she talked with me about church. [[TTTOTW]].

[[Family Time]] was good. Eventually, we went fully dark in the room with our screens since my son was having a serious headache. My wife's [[hint|Give Me A Hint]] to me today: "you're an idiot." Lol. Yup.

My //Star Trek// pack was lacking //Star Trek: Insurrection//, but I don't blame them. It is, by far, the most forgettable (though that MILF is a straight 10). Frakes is a bad person, I hate his character, and I'm glad this was the beginning of the end of his bullshit. Son made pizza. Candy and Vapelyfe.

Put my grill to bed. [[TTTOTW]]. //Skintime// with [[ASK]]. 
<<<

//Skintime// and IASIP. We're gonna keep trying. Sleep by 1?

Woke at 7? I woke up to the sounds of [[ASK]] crying. //Skintime//. Many more tears, but eventually good ones. Fireman Time! [[Morning Routine]]. [[TTTOTW]].

[[j3d1h]], [[1uxb0x]], [[5c0ut]], [[ASK]], and I didn't even need the dolly. Met the truck driver, grabbed a U-haul, and made quick work of it in a few hours.<<ref "w">> Took two trips. The most important stuff survived well. Scott even came out to help on the Vespa (with a ghetto ramp we jerry-rigged); not sure what he felt about the matter. Thanked him, ofc (I'm still lost as to his "wife's" feelings on the matter). We had a good time; it was a merry move (normally, I'm grumpy and under considerable pressures, but not this time).

Perfect timing as usual. Just got on my [[monster]], and Lightning Struck! I feel significantly better. Even the desert flowers blossomed for a few moments. 

Shower. I'm turning into a yeti, with grey/white overriding my black and very dark brown (and pinches of red undertones too) hair. [[TTTOTW]]. [[Killcoin]] called me up!<<ref "al">> We talked for about an hour, and I can scarcely remember even a quarter of it. I said little, as I do these days (and, surprisingly, he is the one who usually listens in his phone calls, so it was a different opportunity for him). Jokes about when we agree sprankled throughout (we agree that we often agree, even if for different reasons). His PT and his massive back surgery were quite painful (worried about various pain meds, though hit the ganja after), especially as he was rushed out of the hospital for covid reasons. His dad's health isn't doing so great either. =/, and he's moving back to their trailer.<<ref "a">> He's climbing again, and next year going for the LSAT. He's rebuilding from scratch on disability with Cobra about to run out (a gall bladder surgery coming up). He hears his ex in his daughter's voice, he's been doing a lot of [[introspection]], and he's been thinkin' more about empathy and [[The Golden Rule]]. I spoke my retarded gibberish for a few moments here and there where I thought it fittin'. My accent was 100%, brings it right out of me. We talked spooks, fuzz (he's not such a back the blue feller anymore), and various opsec concerns. Asked if we owned property yet, and I told him we have a mortgage. He replied it was "renting from the Jews." Fascinating to see the changes in the man, almost dispensationalist but instead  [[identitarian|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Identity]]. He's coming back to Christianity (not necessarily Jesus, as we didn't talk much about what the man actually said), going Reformed Baptist (classic creationist once again), ofc, to you heathens who know nothing. Showed me his 6MWE shirt; it's schwanky. He walked me through his conception of a justified theocracy but bypassed any questions I had about the criterion of authority (passing the buck to elders, `/nod`). He requested that I feel free to get laughs out of my system. I did. His nephew is all growed up, part of the tribe, clearly, hardcore [[pright]]ist memer. Grandparental DNA tests have confirmed his obvious superiority, as a true^^tm^^ Israelite. Trying to go without pr0n. `/salute`. He's still against abortion, but he likes when they occur (only those who he wouldn't want to live anyway). It's interesting to see how much overlap we have (he too thinks most people don't deserve to live). Several references to fascism. Vaxxers are just the wrong type of fascists (he's oldschool, had a problem with being forced to get his MMR to attend college after homeschooling), unfortunately. He's gonna fake his. Overall, he's looking for the end, anticipates it, talks about who is profiting from it. He's more concerned than ever with [[power]] centralization, but he's still looking in the wrong place. Swears he's no longer Libertarian, but I can sniff out even the remnants from a mile away. There are many contradictions in each of us. Again, I offered to help him set up his TW and distribution; I'll read every word, or, don't [[share]] it with me and maintain [[anonymity]] more thoroughly. He needs help doing that well.

Mi amor arrived late, so TableTime is very late as well. Dinner seems all set, as [[5c0ut]] seems to have finished it all. 

[[TTTOTW]] and [[ASK]] brings her many toys around. That girl knows [[hao]] to stim as hard as anyone I've ever met. Oh, and she may have found a fascinating rune<<ref "y">> in her collection (we keep having to pick symbols, even [[k0sh3k]] had us pick out unicode symbols for the fam, no idea for what, something for [[The Alien Asylum]] more generally...quite excited). Mythology. [[IHAT]].

[[Family Gathering]] was called early by [[5c0ut]], but then he didn't participate (that's odd). We had a different meal than I had planned (second time my plans have been thwarted for this evening's meal too), but it was delicious. Pulled pork, cilantro, leftover pickled veggies for Indian food, and corn tortillas (with Roja sauce [no idea where they got the name, but it's good shit]). Melon and water too. Foreman survived the //House// episode (you are shocked). //Skintime//. I was supposed to have sex, but because I decided to follow an early eating schedule, she had a headache by the end.<<ref "g">> At least I got to hear about her day. Toast. Class was good, and everyone (including the professor) is pretty worried about the second mid-term (I just want 80%, even if this is one area of focus).  Trip home took twice the time, insane traffic. Sleep isn't Milligan bad, but it's just not enough. She'll be exhausted until it's time for bed, then like a little kid who knows it's bedtime, she's wide awake and doesn't want to sleep. The schedule she maintains is insane. 

Cleaning. Mi amor played her psaltery for me. Massage. She used the coffeetable to practice her Greek while I [[TTTOTW]]. Then, she went back to practicing her song (a lullaby her mother used to sing long ago). Couple people asked for a recording, so she's gonna practice.

<<footnotes "w" "The weather was chilly, but it warmed up (especially after heavy lifting). The men almost took off their shirts, but we didn't want to scare anyone (I mean, everyone in the house is used to seeing our hairy nips and jelly rolls, but not everyone can handle that). It was good weather to take a walk (with lots of hand-holding).">>

<<footnotes "al" "Also, [[ASK]] brought me soup! Gracias, again.">>

<<footnotes "a" "As a basement-dweller, literally everyone is above me. I'm beneath [[others]].">>

<<footnotes "y" "[[YKWYA]]">>

<<footnotes "g" "God fucking damnit!! I know better. Rule #1: if she is going to have sex with you, shut your god damn mouth and go fuck her, no exceptions, let nothing get in the way, doesn't matter who is dying, etc., etc., etc.">>
