title: 2020.10.16 - Prompted Introspection: A Single Role

!! Think about the various roles you play in your life. If you had to give up all but one, which one would you keep?

This question is expensive to make coherent, both in consistent integrity and justification. I don't know how to speak about atomic roles well enough. The unfolding of life itself appears to be a role. Ofc, [[gfwiwcgws]]. What instrument ought I be? What end ought I serve? I never understand one class until I'm already onto the next, and I wonder if roles can be like that too.
