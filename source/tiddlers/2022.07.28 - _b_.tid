Unofficially officially recession by the objective metric/thresholds stated in advance, but that's not how the Fed has openly interpreted their own data (which is already skewed, and not just that the threshold is based on GDP) so far. The elections aren't over, so we wait. Also, Caymens has skyrocketed in being a foreign creditor to the US, holding more USTs than even Saudi Arabia at this point. Hard to know if and what it means for there to be increasingly [[anonymous]] players in the casino. Four reasons stand out to me: (1) tax evasion (duh), (2) a front to prop up the treasury market, (3) those who publicly signal a boycott still want to privately hodl, or (4) foreigners who might have those assets seized/revoked/unhonored now or in the future. I'm less convinced by the first being sufficient (even if it's a factor) simply because this is new behavior.

One spook I've heard is that Max Stirner was a fictional man created by Engels (the Artist) in order to anger Marx and motivate that saint to counter-rant yet another German Ideology. Cool story.

I only hyperread for overconfidence in my bloated surface knowledge.

I can't tell you how sick it makes me to say Baudrillard was right about anything (like admitting Nietzsche can be interpreted in a light that has any merit). Millions, and eventually billions, of fake sybil accounts generate narratives of trends, with fake trends picked up by fake news, seeding and delivering fake woke idea payloads to the masses drowning in a sea of bots. The only escape is a sufficient percentage of the population following the conventions of owning the means of production, including authentication of authentic users, however authentically unsavory (or even evil) they may be.

Not surprised to see the USMIC becoming venture capitalists in the hopes of throwing off the "yokes" placed on them by the largest contractors. Given the regulation of that space, it's a monopsony.

I'm wondering if there are intermediate languages generated from NLP models that would enable steganographic transfer of data over what would otherwise seem like normal language on a topic of one's selection. If you can use a password, all the better. It probably would have to "translate" the intermediate ciphertext multiple times to improve the odds that one gets the original. Could maybe (stretching it) encode entire cryptographic sessions over it. Unfortunately, while there may not be any proof, in terms of plausible deniability (that part may be quite valuable), it is likely too easy to detect. The model has to be something that can be [[shared]], unobscure FLOSSy, as it were (though there is something to be said for steganography applied to the tools themselves). I suppose detecting that it was MLed without being able to reliably decrypt it would also be useful. I'd be willing to comb through 100 translations to find the one, but that is desperate. Note that one could hunt for ciphertexts that seemed plausible enough. Wonder if more explicit plausible deniability decryption is available. Is it possible to reliably retrieve two different plaintexts from the same ciphertext?
