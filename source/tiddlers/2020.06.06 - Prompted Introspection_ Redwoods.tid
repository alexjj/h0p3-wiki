title: 2020.06.06 - Prompted Introspection: Redwoods

!! Tell about an experience where you felt close to nature.

[[2019.03.13 - Prompted Introspection: Close to Nature]] is this fine introduction. I would like would to see specifics, and I've modified to question to force it. 

I saw the Redwoods once. My god, I feel like I live in a fantasy next to those. They seem so implausible. I feel like what's on the other side will be the giant mushroom forest next where I will dance with a mycogen tribe. It inspires Romantic desires. Who wouldn't want to live in such a tree? Feeling close enough to nature sometimes feels like a supernatural world to me.
