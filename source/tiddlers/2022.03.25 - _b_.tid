May I gain and lose the same 15lbs until I die.

the world economy consists of 199/200 big machines, 1/200 human labour. so, if you want a simple model of the world economy, just delete human labor...the current economy is more Keynesian government stimulus, to avoid bankrupt companies...regulatory capture, though, seems to be a nearly unavoidable emergent property of regulated system, leaving any such system to be unstable over time...some part of the problem is that people are too easy to exploit using artificial scarcity...a stable, smooth Gini gradient is the best way to make an economic system smarter, right?

Affirming your individual metaphysical freedom isn't sufficiently valuable in virtue of authenticity or uniqueness or individuality (none of these being sufficiently worthy themselves either) or any subjective evaluation: it's to recognize and wield our responsibility wisely. Our responsibility is not for the sake of the kind of authenticity concerned with determining one's own life without being determined by other forces, but rather to have chosen the principles categorically worth binding ourselves to (spending our freedom on that which has moral merit). Similarly, authentically confronting existential angst isn't about blindly manufacturing a self-soothing [[stoic]] positive-covert-nihilistic egoism detaching itself from reality and self-hood where convenient while masquerading under the guise of staying true to yourself, becoming who you really are, or keepin' it real: it's about recognizing your place in The World and relation to [[The Other]] with moral integrity, wrestling with [[faith]] in [[good]] [[faith]] (which, obviously requires [[significant doubt|Question Everything]]).

Presumably, if it's not entertaining or flattering, most prefer that notifications are about something urgent, significant, actionable, and authentic regarding an ongoing or immanent concern with one's service to [[others]], while erring on being as hedged-conservatively minimal, quiet, anti-spam as possible. Especially given how few ultimately wish to [[wrestle]] with me, I'm still not convinced I should notify almost anyone at this point. Perhaps guarding someone's {[[Focus]]} like my own.

Prima facie, honesty does not mind being questioned while deception doesn't like being challenged. However, with enough parasites in play, the honest person is too easily abused.
