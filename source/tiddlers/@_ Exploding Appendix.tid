Thank you for [[contact]]ing me, and please let me know if I can [[help]] you, [[nomad]](s). It's my honor to meet you. I'm happy to take your questions like I'm IMing right here (you can bookmark at least this page, if you wish), but we can manage otherwise. Some questions might require their own pages as a response. I can begin with [[these|http://www.explodingappendix.com/2020/09/13/exploding-appendix-questionnaire-james-riley/]] if [[you'd like|2021.06.01 - Exploding Appendix: 1st Questionnaire]]. [[Recent]] is a common {[[focal|Focus]]} point, but you might find [[Family Time Timeline.tmpl]] once a week also pretty decent. Push your questions however you see fit, and I'll construct my version of the story (and you can construct yours). My dear friend [[kickscondor]] allowed me to participate in [[@: hypertext 2020]], and I'm glad I did (also, you should check out multiverse.plus and fraidyc.at). Where should I look for your response? I prefer one place, if possible. I have no proposals besides this one at the moment, though I sometimes take requests for [[Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση]] (you might find that useless, I do not know). It is unlikely I will be able to produce a text you are looking for, I lack what many consider preferred credibility signaling, I must warn you that most people who encounter me grow unhappy with me at some level in how I respond, and I apologize for my incompetence. I will do my best with what I have to respond to you, nomad(s).
