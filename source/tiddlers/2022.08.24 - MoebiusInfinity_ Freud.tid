Was old Sigmund a psycopath?

He was a real mind modeler. And his nephew, Edward, took all of that to another level. And as a result we now have a media system that is based on all of their idea's and is run by people from the same background.

All media, from the Gutenberg printing press, to today's press, radio/TV broadcasting and all the internet giants are all controlled by the same type of people. And also governments are in the same line in all of westworld.

Had he access to the test, he may have scored high on the dark-triad factor test. I simply don't know. The capacity to empathize isn't what makes someone a psychopath. Why a person habitually chooses to turn their empathy on and off (or strengthen/weaken it) is how we determine their degree of psychopathy. Whether or not old Sigmund was a psychopath is largely irrelevant to my argument.

I suggest that the average person on the planet has more access to a broader range of media and voices than ever before (which doesn't mean they exercise their increasingly narrow political rights to information well). Your generalizations about media are sweeping. I remain far from convinced that media systems are largely based on Freud's ideas (though I don't doubt the academic lineage is part of their coursework). Even contemporary academic psychology literature (and to a lesser extent economics) has been demolished, suffering a reproducibility crisis. Marketers, some media specialists, and [[Memetic Warfare]] scientists do work to model their targets' minds, and I'll agree we should have moral problems with why they engage in these practices. And, to get back on topic, I'll even agree that [[The Spectacle]] plays a significant role in why so many people don't care about morality.

My generalizations were limited to 'mainstream' i assumed that that was more clear.

My concern is the religious under current of all of this, All main the religions in this picture stem from the same origins. They all tell the same story, but all with another goal. And just like all identity politics, these 'identity religions' are stacked against each other. (divide & conquer) Those who do this are one level above this and not IN the game.

The chess players are not the king / queen / pawn. They just mode the pieces, sacrifice the least important ones, and eventually start a new game. The players never get hurt... it's the pieces that play the moves they are ordered to, that get 'killed'. In a chess game nobody dies, but in this real world 'game' real people die.

WOPR said something along the lines of: The only way not to lose is not to play, their game, Mr. Falken.

As 'the media' , the MSM are one big propaganda machine, and all propaganda stems from Edward Bernays, who happens to be Freuds nephew I can't help but see that all of MSM is one big Freudian shit show on steroids. Now I did have a few years of focus on Sigmund and Edward, so the other stuff is a bit blurred from my vision. But still i think that i'm very close to reality on this. Also as the entire Frankfurt school is cluttered around all of this. (See Fabian Socialism)

I'm still not sure... but the deeper I dive the harder it is to see it any different, as there are never any facts that tell me that I'm wrong.

I only see people that happen to go along with stuff that is not based on facts, but mostly just the most convenient version of whatever propaganda they consume. (that fits the ideology of the group-think they like to belong to). It's complicated but once you see that the mechanics are the same for all groups then you see the same pattern over and over again. To the point that it becomes 'logical'. And that is a bit unsettling, at least to me...

Your generalization about (presumably) mainstream religions is also sweeping. They do not have the same origins, and they do not tell the same stories. They may have many things in common though. It is not clear to me that all identity politics or all religions are stacked against each other respectively (or that most of the participants see themselves as such). I'll agree that those in [[power]] tend to abuse these movements though. I'll agree that the wealthiest people on the planet (that very likely includes you and me, by the way) almost never really care about the lives of the rest of the planet and instead use others as mere means.

Do you mean to say we aren't morally responsible for intervening on psychopathy's affect on our world? I suggest we are obligated to play some sort of non-mere [[game]] here.

Obviously, we disagree on where "all propaganda stems from." I appreciate your rant, but it's not an accurate representation of reality. I doubt you're really spending much time trying to falsify your beliefs or looking for opposing evidence. It sounds like you've a [[bias]]ed narrative you're looking to defend at all costs here, which sounds remarkably similar to some of the behaviors you are denouncing. Your last paragraph is somewhat accurate, but also likely projection. 

I do find it unsettling. `/nod`.
