Hi there :-)

Thanks, a very kind response to my mean comment. Very funny! I think I got as far as mousing over 'antipleonasmic' and 'Diamonized' on your principles page. But reading further just now, it's not so..repellent/bad/crazy as it seemed. Hehe. Plus the site navigation is bewildering the first time. I was hugely into philosophy in my 20s and 30s (now 48!) .. In my 20s I couldn't understand why Hume would give up philosophy for history, now it makes perfect sense. "Wisdom consists of asking questions instead of taking things for granted. True wisdom consists of taking things for granted instead of asking so many questions. Shut up and deal the cards!" (Was also a religious seeker and realized the "seeker" defines themselves as someone who hasn't found what they're looking for.)

Have you read Dennis Rohatyn's Philosophy, History, Sophistry?! (That was a quote from it) Your writing keeps reminding me of him. It's totally packed with sick jokes and puns, sometimes a few per line. I'm sure you'd love it. (It's very serious also.) Hard to find, well worth ordering online. It has an amazing bibliography too. I love it so much. Also Chesterton is very good on life, philosophy, welcoming the absurd.. Try Heretics then Orthodoxy until it gets too Christian halfway through. I'm into people who can write well, entertainingly, as well as profoundly! The philosophers studied at university are mostly those who write badly and so have interpreters, not readers. Blah blah. 

So what/who are you into? I guess you will point me to a page of your site. Like your HN comments mostly do. I guess unavoidable as your site becomes more and more like your brain. My 2 collections of quotes are the best representation of my brain that I have, it seems almost too revealing to have them online! They show everything I was thinking about. When I come across a quote from the first collection in a book, it usually seems the worst sentence on the page. Which is progress, I guess.

Cheers, Adam
