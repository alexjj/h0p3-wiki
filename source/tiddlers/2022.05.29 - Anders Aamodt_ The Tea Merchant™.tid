title: 2022.05.29 - Anders Aamodt: The Tea Merchant‚Ñ¢

<<<
Everyone I know is so alienated and impoverished that they won't help each other at all. Most people I know who are most capable of helping others have lost faith in helping others. There are a lot of reasons for this, but overall I think the driving force is scarcity. I think artificial inflation impoverishes us all a LOT more than we think, and if people are constantly being stolen from, this generalized scarcity will eventually tear them away from each other. Like the universe expanding/inflating there is more and more space between people the more capitalist alienation and scarcity is rolled out to the public.

I have been thinking for a long time that it might be possible to come up with a new idea or new methodology that is peer-to-peer and that starts by forming a solidarity dyad, then a small group, then gradually a larger and larger group.

This group would help each of its new members become more autonomous and free in their own life in every possible way. So each person to join the movement would get a sort of free life upgrade/makeover where someone will give you a bunch of free stuff and connect you with people and services who will help you for free. Or for example if you're a hoarder, they could bring in a home organizer to help. If you need income, they'll help you find a good job using their network of connections or help you apply for government aid.

In this way, each person who joins the movement gets "popped out" of the Matrix of scarcity and capitalist alienation. Since they'll have a social support network and more of their needs met, this will robustly strengthen the movement of liberated people.

However, it seems like the level of scarcity and the resulting learned resistance to solidarity is even too great even for this tactic to work.

Does anyone have any thoughts on how to overcome this dialectic or create a real solidarity movement?

I have begun by reaching out to people in virtue of my ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî± (a crucial filter and magnet), constructing [[family|Family Time]] we choose, [[Fostering Intimacy]], negotiating [[shared]] goals and priorities, and seeking to [[help]] those who can't help us back. Plucking people from homelessness and building a fortified cell where we grow to own the means of production together is a start (and it's been valuable practice in reasoning about [[justice]]). I can't say we're doing it well enough, and I think we've been [[lucky]] in a lot of ways. There are many strangers on the internets I've met who know we are a safety net for them as well. I don't know how to reproduce it well enough. It requires sacrificial commitment and the belief that one serves something greater than oneself. I also don't think this alone is nearly sufficient for solving the global crises we face; it's only a piece to the puzzle.

Yeah your fun text is awesome! There's someone I know who you should meet about that.

You're right, having capital / property to start a self-sustaining vertically-integrated colony would be the most robust way to do it, but I think it's also possible to accumulate towards that without having a central meeting place or in-person contact. It would be possible if there were a group of people willing to voluntarily adopt rules about how they would distribute aid so as to remain solvent on the way to accumulating the capital to get a commune or some other longer-term sustainable way of doing it together.

Hey, if you like interesting ways of typing, you should meet my friend The Tea Merchant. They have developed a system they call √òHUSHTAGS. If you'd like to talk to them let me know what your Signal or Telegram is.

Thank you. I don't take your recommendation lightly. I'm reading through (or listening) to the majority of their public accounts I can find. I've got their Signal and Telegram information as well. What do you think of √ò(H)√úS(H)TAGZ and their use of "TEA‚Ñ¢"?

<<<
Ha! You found 'em yeah.

Well, the hushtags and silly branding and use of ‚Ñ¢ might seem kind of silly or trashy, but I think there is actually a deep accuracy and wit to it. TM has systematically tried to brand every word/concept they use by maximizing how "branded" the word looks. This makes it easier for their codified versions of the word to stick in memory and replace parochial meanings. I think there's something to it.

TM was originally inspired by my made-up words and style of writing, and they took a few things I was doing such as the ‚Ñ¢ and all-caps hashtags to mark specific concepts, and took it much further in a different direction that I was going. I was using the ‚Ñ¢ mostly ironically but ‚Ñ¢ took it to post-irony with making the branded words. TM has made hundreds of images with word art containing the hushtags and expressing the vibe, sort of like capturing a library of many different spirits. It's pretty impressive as a work of contemporary occultism.

I think you'd have fun talking with them about language‚Äîmaybe they'd be willing to show you some of their hushtag images.

Naw, I use lots of conjured words and ^^tm^^ is a staple of my diet and memebase. There's something to be said for arguing about how we should use language, what we should mean by particular words in various contexts, and so on. In philosophy, we're often engaged in clarifying concepts by either making up new words or revising old ones. I can also appreciate the rhetoric of TheTeaMerchant, including how we may question the [[dok]] of costs of seeking mimetic efficacy.

I'm not convinced there is a post-irony, not so clearly at least. I agree that TheTeaMerchant uses their words sincerely, but I would say the same of you, my friend. Among other things, I cannot say I'm a fan of oc[[cult]]ism, another place we may part, sir. I think we [[share]] quite a bit in common though. 

I'm going to allow them to choose whether or not they wish to interact with me. I'm a very expensive interlocutor sometimes, as you may know. I'm generally not here to have fun, but I [[hope]] we get to have it too, ofc (and, yes, I've found /r/FunQueerTheory useful, interesting, and a great example). I'd be interested in seeing what they show openly, and my [[contact]] page provides the tools I think we should use.
