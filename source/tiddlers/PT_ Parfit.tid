* To be a person, a being must be self-conscious, aware of its identity and its continued existence over time.
* Persons are constituted by, but not identical with, a physiology, a psychology, and the occurrence of a series of causal and cognitive relations.
* Personal identity is not what matters in survival over time; what matters is psychological connectedness and/or continuity ("Relation R").
* Since my much later self would be more like a different person than me, how I should treat him should fall under the rubric of morality, not self-interest.
* Only my current (not past or future) desires/aims that are not intrinsically irrational directly generate reasons for my acting.
* My death only involves that after a certain time, none of the thoughts and experiences that occur will be directly causally related to this brain.
* If any particular person had not been conceived when he was in fact conceived, it is in fact true that he would never have existed.
* A change in the identity of the involved parties in the compared outcomes should not affect our moral evaluation.
* For any population with members having good lives, there can be some larger population whose total happiness is higher, but with members with terrible lives.
* Consequentialism, Kantianism, and Contractualism ultimately converge on the same answers; they can be incorporated into a single Triple Theory.
* An act is wrong just when such acts are disallowed by some principle that is optimific, uniquely universally willable, and not reasonably rejectable.
* Normative truths and our knowledge of them are of a distinctive kind; we should not expect them to be like ordinary, empirical truths and their knowledge.
* Our wealth is legally ours, but the poorest people have much stronger moral claims to some of this wealth.
