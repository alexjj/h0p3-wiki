title: 2022.01.21 - Prompted Introspection: Kushiel's Dart

!! What was the last great book you read? What did you learn from it?

//Kushiel's Dart//. I've learned what [[ASK]] and [[k0sh3k]] think and feel about it. Though it is never explicit (and I've not gone looking for the information either), I feel like I've learned quite a bit about the author from reading a fantasy book, and that is an exceptionally rare treat. This is a unique work, and it requires a particular kind of upbringing and sensibility to appreciate it in full, I think (though, I do not claim to be proficient in this regard). I'm still learning from it. Give me time to understand better, please.
