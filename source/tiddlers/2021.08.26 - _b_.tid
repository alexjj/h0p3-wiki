I guess my only [[hope]], Obiwan, is that we eventually collect so much orbiting space junk (with carbon scoring) that we can no longer safely send anything into space, and then we can stop talking about trying to escape our planet rather than saving it, and then we can bury our heads and burrow into the crust instead. `/raises-his-divacup-shotglass`, a toast, to urf (what a shithole, man) and its filthy animals.

When I see your dog mounting people in front of me (y u m), I know what yall are accustomed to doing in the [[privacy]] of your home (and, of course, I only know this because I've trained //so// many dogs to do the same).

My neopronouns are [the validating recitation of this entire ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱, [[ITS]]]/[the unknown symbols that complete me]. You don't know me, and you're persecutively disrespeccin' me until you do, okay? It's so simple, and I can't be asked to fit any other mold, labels, or generalizations because this was always just about me.

We did it ~~simps~~ bois; we killed skydaddy using nihilism with space facts (thank you spooky science), and now our lives mean extra nothing to me (especially the sheeple's...gross). I'll act like I lament it and pretend there's a way to recover meaning, but that's just a lulz puppet show I put on for the goth Disney Adults before I cry my Überself to sleep (we doth protest too much, methinks). Stop strawmanning my strawman of Christianity while I disfigure then repackage the moral implications of the concept of eternity and call it my own invention, k? don't worry, my belief system won't hypocritically generate the very thing I said I was fighting against (just play both sides so you always come out on top), and i swear i didn't know it all along.
