title: 2020.07.29 - Prompted Introspection: From The Ashes

!! Who is one of your favorite writers?

[[2019.09.15 - Prompted Introspection: Favorite Writers]] hits me hard today. We're struggling, yet again, to get anything done in school in a self-starting manner. I continue to work hard to help my offspring care about their own words with themselves and [[others]] as best I can. Ups and downs. Yeah, it is my privilege to read and reflect on their words, even in profound disagreement, silence, and with negative feelings. 

I forgot to question what it means to "write." I'm not so good at picking this out (you think I would be, right?...lawd knows, I've written enough that I should). Shit. The more I look at that problem, the less I know how to write about it. Let's pretend, overcharitably, that we've somehow answered it, bridge a gap, throw me a bone, take a leap that we both understood something we don't here: as I gather and digest my hyperreading, it becomes clearer and clearer to me that only a few voices consistently pick out in [[The Great Human Conversation]] (even 20% of the time) something worth at least glancing at. Who picks out what is [[salient]]?

[[Ph03niX]] does. Quite unlike me, I do not argue with this person (and, my god, we have some disagreements, but there's no point to slicing them in half because they do such irreplacably critical work): I only listen as they race against the world in triage. I don't even bother them because I wouldn't want to scare them off (which they intimated/headfaked, as though I were some spook) or interfere with what obviously requires enormous amounts of energy.<<ref "w">> They perform a profound service for [[Humanity]]. They are an outlier we need but don't deserve. They know we're probably going to lose, but they still fucking bring it. I respect their vocation, tenacity, purpose, patience, and integrity. I'm [[grateful]] they exist. I wish them luck. Godspeed.
