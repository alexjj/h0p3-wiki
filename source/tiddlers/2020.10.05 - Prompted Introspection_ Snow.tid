title: 2020.10.05 - Prompted Introspection: Snow

!! You look outside: Ah, it is snowing! But look closer. Those are not snowflakes falling from the sky! What is it snowing at your house?

I think the activity of "snowing" can occur with many kinds of objects, including potato flakes, words, mana, organic marine particles, dandruff, powdered sugar, ashes, and perhaps even the fabled carbon scoring. If snowing is about the appearance of how objects fall, then it still seems likely that it was snowing at my house. 

I don't like your question, Samwise. I don't know what is most likely snowing besides standard snow. If you want a fiction, I hope it's dolla dolla bills, yall.
