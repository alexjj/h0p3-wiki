title: 2021.10.21 - Prompted Introspection: Sex Work Is Not Conceptually Morally Degrading

!! Regardless of your conscious beliefs or actions, do you feel in your gut that sex work is degrading?

Why should my gut be considered regardless of my conscious beliefs or actions? I'm not convinced they can be peeled apart so easily either. Maybe it isn't relevant to you, but my gut on the matter is heavily influenced by having been raised by Evangelical fundies, and also having thought about moral philosophy for a couple decades. I have a non-trivially conditioned gut (not just because I'm fat :P) instinct or feeling about the matter, but I think it merits questioning. My gut tells me my gut isn't enough.

I feel that sex work isn't so easy to define (including something as innocuous seeming as just going to dinner with someone). Sex is a type of work, first of all, but not all sex (or work) is morally degrading. Sex work also isn't necessarily an occupation, nor is it strictly concerned with money (though perhaps always [[power]] to some [[dok]]). It is also not so easy to decouple most kinds of sexual behavior in our species from mating markets in general. Perhaps, you mean engaging in sex [[FTSO]] improving one's material condition outside of one's own pleasure derived from the act itself (which, to be very careful in our analysis, there are instances of what is normally considered sex work that don't satisfy this standard so obviously). I'm also not sure what kind of degradation to pick here. Degrading to whom, [[gfwiwcgws]]? You probably mean to ask about moral degradation, failures to respect the dignity of one's personhood, and violations of our obligations to these people. Is it morally wrong to be a sex worker? Is it morally wrong to transactionally have sex with a sex worker? Neither are perfect moral obligations from what I can see. Both can be engaged in without treating the other as mere means, and I suggest that if sex can be moral, and if work can be moral, (and they can), then so can sex work. Depending on how you want to wave your hands on the definitions here, I suggest sex work is not conceptually degrading. There are instances of sex work that aren't fundamentally different from any other kind of work in any moral respect.

I'm not a fan of relying upon my gut alone to answer this question. That is not sufficient for a justified judgment.
