title: 2021.07.30 - Prompted Introspection: To Love

!! If you could have one but not the other, would you rather love someone or be loved by someone?

[[JHBFC]], Samwise, your choice to crib [[Sphygmus]]'s questions was a terrible idea!!<<ref "j">> These are heavy questions. I can barely lift them, let alone answer them. You're supposed to throw me softballs, dude. I'm weak, out of practice with [[Prompted Introspection]], and I've become even more smootherest-brained. Fine. Another complex [[Love]] question. That's sane.

My initial concern is that you can't achieve this cleanly; it's not obvious that you can peel these apart for me. Even if it is conceptually possible, it's not easy to pick out a method for someone to [[love]] me without //me// having at least some kind of indirect love for them. Set aside quantifiers in some sense (I love people who love), and perhaps there are people who can love me without my understanding or being able to become aware of that fact. I don't know the impact of that love, so I'm not in a position to speak of the consequences. I think the unintuitively selfish conclusion here is that I would prefer to love because I'm the agent that gets to choose to do so, that even knows such a thing is occurring. It's the stuff that makes it worth living.<<ref "p">>

There's short-circuits everywhere. Here's another concern: I am someone, and if I am not loved by someone, then I don't even love myself, which means I'm not following The Moral Law either. Answer have to be love someone, right?

[[Like]] might be the word you're searching for. Also, are we talking about a particular instance between me and an[[other]], or is this applied to all cases? I hate to give the weasel's answer: it depends on the context. That's not satisfying.
