title: 2022.06.20 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: My Nephews

<<<
Arose at 12:30. Cannot fucking sleep. Anxiety too. Thirst has not been quenched for an eternity. Fireman Time! Not even close. 

[[5c0ut]] was up. He's been so busy we just couldn't do our bi-monthly. Not as critical here. The story and strategizing matter more. Talked in the kitchen for an hour and half. He rabbitholed. Tears of joy and a lot of emotions too. He's got //another// executive chef interview lined up, which he'll stage for, and it's Asian cuisine, but there's probably not nearly as much room for creativity and ownership of the process. 

Forgot my glasses in mi amor's room. She was phasing in and out. //Skintime//.

[[TTTOTW]].

//The Walk// with my sympaticon. 

Sleep for an hour or so. Woke at 6:30. Final pack. Woke my sympaticon for final hugs.

//The Trip//. 14 hours. Stopped for gas twice (amazing gas mileage on this car). Far less conversation than usual (nobody slept last night, so we all were sleeping whenever we could). We had fish for lunch, and then sammiches for dinner. Signs of supply chain problems. I got some sleep here and there. We listened to several chapters of //A Canticle for Leibowitz// (everyone is way into it).

Arrived. Seeing the changes, quick catchup, placing stuff. Chat with my sympaticon and [[5c0ut]].

Asynch [[Family Time]]. Chillin' at [[JRE]]'s famous table (I am fondly reminded, even though they don't look the same, of Grandma Bubbles' table) while my offspring play //Elden Ring// and talk gaming shop with their uncle on his new machine (and the other adults who are awake are writing). [[TTTOTW]].

[[TTTOTW]] with fam in the living room. We are huddled around 3 screens. 

//Inform the Men!//. [[TTTOTW]]. Sleep by 2.

Woke at 10? Hard sleep. Mi amor forgot to take any meds, but she got some too. Fireman Time! Meditation. Chat with my sympaticon. Pushed brix.<<ref "v">> [[JRE]] showed me his CPAP machine, got to try it out (they've improved how these things work considerably since the last time I tried one). Manual breathing. I like the adaptive part of how it works. I could sleep on my back without interruptions with it, perhaps. 

Chilled. Minor chats, ate some fajitas, watched people play [[vidya]] [[games]], did some dishes. [[TTTOTW]]. 

[[JRE]] took me to his doctor's appointment. Forgot just how many hospitals there are in this region. Wandered. He's got a procedure coming up. `/fingers-crossed`. Tested out of headstart. Working on this house makes little sense if they are moving for school districts (as the lines have recently been redrawn in a disfavorable way). 

Ate subs, my brother's treat, and just chilled. It's been a long time. Then my brother took me to a well, but we weren't able to open it. I still got to see how the stations look.

I got to see my nephews in-person for the first time. They are cute AF. Took some time to let them get used to us. They played with their toys on my head and face and climbed all around me. Played with a lot of toys. [[Q]] can count to 10. [[Bn]]'s upper body strength is impressive. He can climb well. [[Bn]] is very talkative.

Took my nephews out back with my sister-in-law. We played in the water, with their soccer ball, and on the swings. [[Q]] had me run around behind the side of the house (blocked by a bush) to play with the hose tap. Talked with [[Rb]] about their plans for the future. She's increasingly convinced they will need to move. The adoption can't come soon enough.

Lots of energy in the youngsters. They were surrounded. 

[[Family Gathering]]. Tacos were delicious. I almost never buy sour cream, but once we start doing tacos again: we should. [[Bn]] and [[Q]] went to bed, and I conked out immediately.

Woke at 10? Pushed brix. That bidet head is like an adjustable waterpick. Those who remained awake gathered in the living room to be on the machines. Together ape compute strong. [[TTTOTW]]. Put mi amor to bed. Vapelyfe.

//The Walk// with my sympaticon. Vapelyfe. My brother has lived here for 8 years. Thinkin' about what another 8 might be like. Has an old school urban vibe to it, with the Kentucky humidity and cricket drone.

[[TTTOTW]].
