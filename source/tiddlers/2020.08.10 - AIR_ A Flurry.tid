So cool. I have only seen one other painting like this "starry night" and you could walk into it. This was cool to see it being done.

[2:31 PM] [[k0sh3k]]: Rethinking my post-death plans:

[2:31 PM] [[h0p3]]: We'll bury you with your books.
[2:32 PM] [[AIR]]: What if the books were what made the coffin. So we can think she's surrounded by what she loves
[2:32 PM] [[h0p3]]: We could do that. Hollow me out, and her corpse would wear my corpse as a corpse's corpsesuit.
[2:34 PM] [[AIR]]: No no no... Do you think you suffocate her enough she doesn't need it in death lol
[2:34 PM] [[h0p3]]: I am suffocating, at any distance. She will never escape me.
[2:34 PM] [[AIR]]: What if we made your body into a portion of like a book of the Dead that way she can carry it with her
[2:35 PM] [[AIR]]: Is there such a thing like a druid necromancer
[2:35 PM] [[h0p3]]: oh god
[2:35 PM] [[AIR]]: Lol
[2:35 PM] [[h0p3]]: The unspeakable horror
[2:37 PM] [[AIR]]: :grin:
[2:38 PM] [[AIR]]: Just think of it and army of squirrels, deer... other animals
[2:38 PM] [[AIR]]: All of them undead
[2:41 PM] [[AIR]]: https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/7g256t/necromancer_druid/&ved=2ahUKEwi_x8ro3onrAhUJP60KHbX3A4AQrAIoAHoECAoQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2jfUxzZ6_Pl0K8om9sawMW
[3:05 PM] [[k0sh3k]]: I'm already undead, so if I was an undead druid, maybe I would naturally (PI) be drawn to working with undead creatures.
[3:07 PM] [[AIR]]:

[3:08 PM] [[AIR]]: What does that make me since they had to stop my heart and then restart it but it was only like 2 seconds
[3:09 PM] [[AIR]]: I was conscious. guess it doesn't count
[6:37 PM] [[k0sh3k]]: You can be undead, too.

[1:15 AM] [[JRE]]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRu_-9MBpd4
[1:17 AM] [[h0p3]]: I want to try cocaine once some day.
[1:23 AM] [[AIR]]: I have tried it twice. It's a waist of money
[1:24 AM] [[h0p3]]: :frowning:
[1:25 AM] [[AIR]]: And especially now you don't even know what it may be cut with. A lot of people have died because it will be cut with fentanyl.
[1:26 AM] [[AIR]]: Not worth loosing any braincells over it.
[1:26 AM] [[h0p3]]: We will have to make our own some day then!
[1:28 AM] [[AIR]]: I don't know if I would take it again even if we made it. I don't want to risk my heart getting more fucked up than it is already haha
[1:28 AM] [[AIR]]: I would need to think about it
[1:29 AM] [[h0p3]]: Naw. That makes sense. I wouldn't.

[10:01 PM] [[AIR]]: @[[h0p3]]  there's a conspiracy here for the use of this AI dungeon. See what they aren't telling you is that by using this game,  AI's will take over the world by cause of a nuclear fallout. but here's a secret all the bunkers that were built before little computers were all super fancy and what not the ai's are not able to connect or take control of anything down in those bunkers.
[10:01 PM] ScoutsAnthem: So the select few that do make it around the world into bunkers end up getting a small dose of radiation over the years giving them super powers and so this AI in particular and learning how to defeat our future selves who are wizards because they end up getting super powers
[10:02 PM] [[h0p3]]: Lol!
[10:03 PM] [[AIR]]: Ohhh it has a multiple player on it!
[10:03 PM] [[h0p3]]: Aye. No idea how it works.
[10:21 PM] [[AIR]]: Just so everyone knows you have to create an account for it to generate a story otherwise you can't play it
[10:31 PM] [[K]]: Can I pin this? I wanna play with it on my next rainy day!
[10:31 PM] [[h0p3]]: Of course!
[10:32 PM] [[h0p3]]: I don't know how long I will continue paying for the service, but I'll make sure it's at least a month.

[5:13 PM] [[JRE]]: Quarantine cut wasn't cutting it.
[5:14 PM] [[h0p3]]: Looks good on you.
[5:14 PM] [[h0p3]]: He's bigger! :slight_smile:
[5:17 PM] [[AIR]]: Wow! You have a very nice shaped head. Jeezz your eyes dude, I never realized how pretty your eyes were.
[5:18 PM] [[JRE]]:
[5:19 PM] [[AIR]]: Lmao
[10:37 PM] [[AIR]]: You and hope are so lucky you can shave your heads  like that. I got lumps on my head
[10:38 PM] [[JRE]]: I have one on my head-- just can't see in that shot :stuck_out_tongue:
[10:38 PM] [[h0p3]]: Mine are growing back
[10:38 PM] [[h0p3]]: Sebacious cysts
[10:38 PM] [[AIR]]: I had no clue you all had them :open_mouth::exploding_head:
[10:39 PM] [[h0p3]]: Had a minor outpatient surgery thing where they cut them out.
