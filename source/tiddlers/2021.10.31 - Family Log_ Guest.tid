!! How has your health been this week?

* 1uxb0x
** Good, except for a headache
* j3d1h
** Decent.
** :]
*** :]
**** =)
* k0sh3k
** So many headaches...
*** But my new doctor is jumping to the next thing instead of making me redo all the meds, so that's good! Fingers crossed, insurance doesn't deny. 
* h0p3
** Sleep schedule is being reshaped again, but I am getting enough. My penis is scabbing and reopening. I think I am allergic. I'm quite unhappy about that.
* ASK 
** I'm improving. I'm sleeping a lot more, even though I know it doesn't look like it. I haven't vomited since arriving, and that was a multiple times a day thing before. I have partially reaquired the ability to feel hunger. Progress is heartening. I don't want to talk about my chest. I will, if you ask specifically.

!! What was interesting to you last week?
* So many new instruments to learn! And both of them super easy. 
** You've already played that harp before though, right?
*** Yep! But it's been, like, thirty-five years...
* I wore jeans to work! 
* HALLOWEEN! 
** No one really going out, but we're dressing up anyway.
* This is gonna be the first halloween where I won't be going outside.
* Number one for me, would have to be here, specifically. The trip is a distant second.
* [[ASK]] has arrived! [[The Alien Asylum]] feels more rounded out. Instant fam.
* [[monster]]-20 is alive, `/salute` to [[monster]]-14. You served us well (and it's not your fault that Google et. al.  made you).
* The basement has been gettin' fixed up. 
* LolWorlds (simping)

* 1uxb0x
** I'm pretty happy I started using this for family time.
** Thank you for working so hard on the floor downstairs. You dun good, kid. 
** I'm really glad you're moving on to multiple notes on the psaltery! 
** Your memes are immaculate sometimes.
*** butt values
** You did all the major work laying new concrete in the garage/basement, and it looks good, sir.
** The force of your attention is both kind and strong. You are a pleasure to interact with.
* j3d1h
** I'm glad I reached out to some of my inspirations for art advice.
** I enjoy that you will often come to me to think about your characters with.
** Thank you for being all Halloweeny with me! 
** Thank you for handling selling the car! 
** Your levels of sass are pure inspiration. I am a very happy audience. Your verbal stillettos are well crafted and preternaturally sharp.
** [[Rust]] is lookin' sharp, madame, and we've all enjoyed your conversations with us on the topic.
* k0sh3k
** I'm actually pretty happy with my Greek work this week.
** Also, I did a good job picking up how to play the bowed psaltery. 
**Also also, I didn't hurt myself pulling the broken string, that's a pretty big accomplishment for me. 
** I'm the actual worst person in the house, according to CAH. That's an accomplishment, too? 
*** `/shakes-fist`
** Thanks for the psaltery.
** You're sounding good on your instrument. 
** Good job with your neurologist, including all the work you've done to get there. 
** Thanks for frequently helping me pick out tropes (both in building and interpreting works).
** Your wry, dry humor, persistence, and sheer variety of interests makes the world a much more fun place to be.
* h0p3
** I feel like I'm doing alright bouncing between all the people in my life, being useful to all them well enough.
** Thank you for watching terrible shows with me. It's been fun. 
** Thank you for heading back out to get gas in my car after getting back from NY. I appreciate it.
**Thank you for wearing pants tonight. 
*** You're a good man, Charlie Brown. 
** Thank you for grabbing us links in about every link log.
** Thanks for the DQ, it was great.
** conversing with you is both exhilarating and difficult and I have never enjoyed conversation more. And I like me some conversation. 
* ASK
** I love your choice in music. (Absolutely going to base a character off of //My name is ruin// someday.)
** After one whole game of CAH, it's obvious you belong with us. I'm glad to have you here! 
** Thank you for helping us with the downstairs flooring.
** You're exceptionally empathic. You understand people well, and you're kind in how you think about even the little things.
** You've done a really good job moving and integrating, going 100 miles an hour.
** You didn't die or kill anyone. Good job.
