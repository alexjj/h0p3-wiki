I'd be indebted to you for even just your guesses:

* Do you predict there will be an ideal approach in the next three decades for someone who would spend $1000 for a model?
* Would the odds be improved significantly if a user would be content with combing through hundreds of outputs to help them reason about what they might say?
* Do you have tips for what an ideal corpus should be like?
* Do you predict such a model would be significantly useful for increasing the signal-to-ratio in searching other files for what the user may find salient?
* Is there hope for a serious stylometric-masking paraphraser that runs on desktops (and even phones)?
* Will it ever be feasible to steganographically hide and recover plaintext messages (even with only partial confidence in the recovery process, which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing) within a stegotext generated and revealed by machine learning?
