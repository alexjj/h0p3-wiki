title: 2020.11.15 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Suå°ºprise Encounter

* Read+Write
* I did not jack off. No time. My retarded brain was busy.
** I'm sorry, penis. Forgive me, for I know not what I do.
* Sleep by 7
** Sun was coming up, and I knew that if I didn't get to sleep, my skin would would start melt off.
* Woke at 1:30
** Dreams. I woke with a band of pressure around my head. I felt like I had worked in my dreams.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Wife had waited to make a call to the realtor until I came to bug her. h y p e.
** Her tummy is not feeling good. Constant rain helps explain it too.
*** Ginger seems to be helping.
** Success, we think. Scheduled to sign off on Tuesday. 
** I hand her the standard lines of reasoning again to reassure. She already knows. I'm just there with her.
* Read+Write
* [[R]] asked how I was doing. I dropped what I was doing and called her up. Storm has fucked up communications on their end though. 
** No matter, I prefer to write it anyway.
* [[Family Time]] @ 5
* [[TTP]]s went poorly. Both my offspring have been lying.  
** Clarifications were useful. It is expensive to dishonestly pull my skin into the game. [[h0p3]] don't play, yo. I prepare for decades of battle.
*** I hope my daughter will see how to draw those lines better.
** I hope my wife will be able to let go too. We've been here so many times.
* //The Walk// + 1-on-1s
** I'm glad we all have umbrellas. Rained hard while we walked in the dark passage. 
** You know, of the various kinds of rebellion, this is still a kind that is not too destructive (even if it is costly). I count us lucky.
** It was a pleasant walk. It's nice that we can change gears.
* The Meal
** Pizza + Coffee
** [[MTG]]
*** Wife played Pacificism +2 vs UR Delver (aimed to pick something straightforward). She remembers the deck enough to know to mull for Leyline. I take g1, and she takes g2 (playing around double daze + pierce to drop Leyline and then chantstick to lock me out).
*** Son demolishes my daughter in MUC +2 vs Affinity. I cleared up more rules questions with DoTV (and described why damage is so irrelevant to the control role).
* Read The Wikis
** Only adults to read. It was fun. 
*** My wife read [[Sphygmus]]' as well, since she can read 2-3 times as fast as anyone else. I hope that will become a habit. 
* [[Family Log]]
** It got way too late. We took too long.
* [[AIR]] VCed
** Cool that he called me while on the job. 
** Sucks about how they treated him at the other one. Inhumane. =(.
