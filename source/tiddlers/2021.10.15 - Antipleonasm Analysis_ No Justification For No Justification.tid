title: 2021.10.15 - Antipleonasm Analysis: No Justification For No Justification

!! Respond to [[the following|Why Not A Wide Area Network, Watson?]]:

People who feel a profound need to justify themselves have difficulty in understanding the viewpoints of those who do not.

Sometimes, but that's not obviously true. I do not see why we should agree. There's a ton of conversational implicature locked away in your claim. I am, of course, impressed, zenmaster, by lazy, rhetorical thought-terminators. You're an evolved Cratylus, maybe: arguing in bad [[faith]]. And, I suppose the point is to stop arguing about justification: just believe whatever you want to believe. The oldest trick in the book. So, be silent.<<ref "o">>

What does it mean to understand irrationality, evil, the ineffable, or the being of non-being? And, further, what does it mean to understand the viewpoint of someone who has anti-realist perspectives? I non-trivially understand what you mean and the implications of what you're saying when you claim (that is what you are claiming, right?) you don't feel the need to justify yourself, `/wink`.<<ref "i">> Odds are decent I sufficiently know what kind of creature you are by that claim too, and I have justification for it. XD.

Insofar as understanding is qua justification, even those who hold the claim they do not need to justify themselves may also either have difficulty understanding themselves or outright do not understand themselves in a crucial manner. Infact, it seems like they understand those who attempt to justify themselves far less than the other direction. It is unclear why, philosophically (which, of course, is essentially concerned with justification by definition), they are any better off.<<ref "c">> On my most charitable interpretation: I don't think you even know what you've said: you're arguing for and from malicious ignorance. Don't get me wrong: I understand there comes a point where there's no longer a point to arguing with a given agent, but that's not what you said.

You are dismissed, and you deserve to be too.
