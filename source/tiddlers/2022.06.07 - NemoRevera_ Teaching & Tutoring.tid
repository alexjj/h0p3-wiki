"""
[9:42:17][NemoRevera] Indeed, I can't tell when it began to move me. From a very early age I was fascinanted by History, how different and distant they were from us, but yet, so much like us, Human all too Human. So Classical Literature for me simply started as a way to enter into History, on how they saw things and saw fear, dread, sadness, passion, love and etc... It's sublimity simply moved at a certain point. There's still hope, they might discover it later on. Oh, Good for you.
[9:47:06][NemoRevera] I do this everytime someone asks me: "what do you do?". I don't want a job to define me. That is quite wise, I wish I had do humility to see people that way, I adore listening to different worldviews and ideas but I can't avoid sometimes feel sad for how simplistic and innoncent sometimes they are. I couldn't put in another words what I feel towards Kierkegaard...
[10:02:18][NemoRevera] Oh I wish I had soo much self-discipline. The trick is buying alot of books and feeling guilty if you don't read them.
[10:03:42][h0p3] XD
[10:06:28][NemoRevera] I see Classical Literature as a quite broad spectrum, but as of the moment I would recommend Oblomov by Goncharov, The Death of Ivan Illych by Tolstoi, Man and Superman by Bernanrd Shaw, Life of Samuel Johnson by Life of Samuel Johnson, anything by Lucian Samosata and also anything by Joseph Conrad
[10:07:10][NemoRevera] The list would be too big, I am quite a bibliophile
[10:07:37][NemoRevera] * Life of Samuel Johnson by James Boswell
[10:09:59][NemoRevera] It makes it temporary because I don't want to make a life out of it. I am quite young and I still want to continue my studies. I love learning, so It would be pure egoism not sharing. How so? How it changed you?
[10:17:31][NemoRevera] I teach Portuguese and English. I also tutor Philosophy and History. Some students do stand out, some because they are hardworking, other because they have a great sense of humor and other because altough not hardworking, they are extremely intelligent and crave to know more. I have some problems with the teachers, some are almost a pure reflection of what the Stanford Prison Experiment once showed. Education as a whole is a poor state right now, its either seen as a mere stage or as another line for a curriculum vitae. I believe that Education is essential but not the way people see it or how it is being done. It is sad to think that someon like Epictetus in our time would never be known or even recognized as a intellectual.
[10:20:18][NemoRevera] "I work on problems that only a madman in the desert would consider" that immediately reminded me of the desert fathers. But problems who stand far from public perceptions are exactly sometimes the ones that should be considered.
[10:22:24][NemoRevera] That is a quite fascinating family. I am very happy for you my friend. How do you feel about you uniquely organize your family? or about education as a whole?
[10:38:19][h0p3] I may need to work on my question then. I totally appreciate the revulsion at the "what do you do?" I think our jobs do define us to some extent (which I do not claim this occurs in a [[good]] or [[fair|Justice]] manner, at all). That's part of why ask, "What do you do to survive in the world?" instead, but I perhaps I should follow it up more consistently with, "What do you prefer to do with your precious freetime?" 
[10:42:25][h0p3] I am sure that Saint Kierkegaard would fully appreciate your feelings and thoughts that you couldn't put into words that would satisfy your requirements. 
[10:43:55][h0p3] Though you be at least partially joking about the buying a lot of books, I think there's something to that. Might be a mindhack of sorts, but when we pay resources (beyond our time) for something, we'll tend to judge it as being more valuable or interesting (might be post hoc).
[10:45:23][h0p3] I've downloaded audiobooks of your recommendations. Thank you.
[10:45:35][h0p3] They'll be [[shared]] on this network as well.
[10:48:50][h0p3] [[Your Words Scream Out At Me|YWSOAM]]. 
[10:50:04][h0p3] It might be a special hell sometimes trying to work from within the education system to provide a realâ„¢ Education. 
[10:51:37][h0p3] There is only so much one person can do. `/nod`. 
[10:52:08][h0p3] Your students are [[lucky]] to have you as their teacher, even though they probably don't know that. 
[10:55:46][h0p3] I feel a kinship with the desert fathers sometimes. Those who live outside The City are sometimes useful outliers in our signaling graphs (no mere spectacle to me).
[10:58:02][h0p3] I can imagine that Epictetus' voice is drowned out by unending floods of entertainment available. I fear our species will not escape the pursuit of the aesthetic. 
[11:00:15][h0p3] One day at a time with my family, still trying to figure out how the pieces go together, what our ends will be, how we can be fittingly useful to what is outside of ourselves. We're almost like monks contemplating in a monastery sometimes. 
[11:02:08][h0p3] You might find [[Afterschool Teaching]] to be relatable. 
[11:03:29][h0p3] I'm autistic, so I'm too often mindblind and incapable of successfully navigating a wide variety of social situations (even where many children succeed). 
[11:03:48][h0p3] My perspective on education is skewed by that, no doubt.
[11:06:22][h0p3] I think it's nearly a contradiction in me, that I have so much shit to talk about education and yet I still feel compelled to recommend the best post-secondary education someone can get (in addition to self-teaching*).
[11:07:24][h0p3] Most of the problems boil down to how capitalists have oppressed people around the world, and education has been hollowed out and continually restructured for the sake of the will to power of the few who already have more than they should. 
[11:09:06][h0p3] Saint Aristotle's perspective on education in virtue theory is something I take seriously.
