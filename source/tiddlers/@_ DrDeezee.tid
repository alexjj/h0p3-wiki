Yes, I've explored tiddlywiki.

I may one day again explore it. I survived meeting God face to face (he climbed down the tree of sephiroth as I climbed up it) so my priorities have shifted in a big way, now. I'm taking action on things I should have done a long time ago.

Yes, sir. `/salute`. Godspeed. May you find what you are looking for.

Here's my [[RGM]]. You have a read-only copy. I speak from this ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 in most cases, and you can use whichever medium suits you. Some speak to me from their sites, some using e-mail, some IM, and if you want to continue using Reddit, that works. My preference is a wiki+IMing for our [[hyperconversations]], but I will work with what I'm given.

I can see that you are fully capable of living on multiple platforms, and I agree that you've put significant skin in the game with me. Very few of my interlocutors [[PSM]] as thoroughly as you. Thank you.

You may have to teach me a little bit how to converse with you via the wiki; it's not immediately apparent to me how I might leave comments / contribute / etc.

I have so much skin in the game these days that I'm not really perturbed when I'm de-platformed or what have you.

Indeed, [[it|https://www.reddit.com/user/DrDeezee/comments/msse24/hoping_this_type_of_a_post_can_summon_you_h0p3/]] did summon me! =). Hope you slept well. For the record, you clearly aren't the asshole for holding non-standard views and earnestly/honestly sharing them. 

I'll continue the conversation from the wiki (as you can see: I don't trust Reddit as a platform). Some people bookmark their "person page."
