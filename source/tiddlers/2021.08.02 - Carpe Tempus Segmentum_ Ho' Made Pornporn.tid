<<<
I'm at the fun point in the [[Music: Library]] update: I'm integrating the //Dreams// section into //Focus//. I'm very pleased with my catch.

Lightning Struck! + Watermelon (half of one :P)

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! Attempted sleep by 4.

Woke at 11?

I have no idea why she came down, but: Inform the Firemen! (thighs holding sleeves require a portmanteau). Meditation. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

We went into The City for someone's Big Shit celebration. Pitazikis (though, the lady didn't even ask me what I wanted on it, she just dressed it up like I was too retarded to specify...she might be right, a wizard or something). We sat in the park and had a good time. My son wandered to read the chalkart. The girls led the conversation, the boys chimed in with their spergs where fitting. You know that feeling when your with your group of friends, and the world is your stage? That's it. That's what it felt like. It was the lowkey, low-effort, EZ [[Family Time]] of the day.

We watched //Raising Arizona//. I did dadnap some, but what could be more fitting? They [[like]]d it (chuh-ching!). 

[[Family Time]]. People [[shared]] what they had. My daughter's sharp tongue continues to become a whip. They clearly did not earn the right to force me to watch the 4th Indiana movie (~~thank fucking god~~ sadly). No matter: the adults had plenty to think about. She laughed her ass off at the [[Anonymous]] [[Chatlog]]s (though we had different interpretations, and clearly, my autism is showing). I did good, breh (you love to see it). =D. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Bad news about [[Chrischan|https://i.redd.it/gwf62i53jre71.png]]. =(. Unrelatedly* (I swear): Fireman Time! Cleaning.

Dark Chocolate + LolVod + Footbath. I was going to go for 5, but I'm not cool enough. Couldn't even finish the LolVod. The interwebs sucked me right in, `/shakes-fist`, [[TTTOTW]].

[[TTTOTW]]. Lots of fruit. Also, nectarines went bad. I know better. I should have eaten those first. Spoke with [[anon]]s, those poor bastards. Sleep by 4. 

Woke at 11. Massive dreams, but noise took me out of my sleep. Couldn't get back. Meditation. Fireman Time! Took at shit. [[Morning Routine]].

//The Walk//. We Warrened today; lightning storms throughout the elephant's foot. Where I get to let go at break-neck speed to wander as hard and fast as I can in the desert to show it. I gave my best arguments for tying Saint Marx and Hegel together (and Heidegger, Kant, and Aristotle, but stop it, you know it's difficult to talk about ends in themselves) that I could muster. They followed well and charitably. My daughter has honed instincts here. It's marvelous. Also, she is skilled in picking out people's nightmares and most hated responses. It's not just with me that she can do this, though it is only with me that she practices it so thoroughly (her words, ofc), "[[pussy]]" and so on and so forth.

Arguing for `ranger` in this project. My daughter explained to me that sometimes she just prefers to eat gnutella straight. `/nod`. That is my daughter, since she was the weeest of lasses. Arguments about lazy, dangerous users who maintain state by keeping the machine powered on and never killing the application. Guilty. GUILTY! Always. Oh, back to the argument of virtue in an art. Spent time spoonfeeding and massaging data. I often know when they aren't actually trying.

Prep for dinner. //Foundation// @ 4:38:56. We hit the primary denouement of the book, imho. We finished up the initial [[audit]] of the files. Now we grow it.

She came down to give me hugs. Gangsta as fuck, cuh. //Skintime// until her neck couldn't take it anymore.

[[Family Gathering]]. [[5c0ut]] might not be able to get in for the Fall (it's so late to apply, I'm surprised it's even possible `/fingers-crossed`). We had ribs, wedges, watermelon, salad, water. Single episode of //Arrested Development//. I think I may have dozed off after that? I was in a stupor at the very least.

//Skintime//. Put my girl to bed. She was exhausted. Not before I got her to laugh though. XD.

I decided I won't be posting my [[Music: Library]] on plebbit again. Fuck it. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Lightning Struck! <3. Life is good.
