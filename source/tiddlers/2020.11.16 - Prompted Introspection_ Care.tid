title: 2020.11.16 - Prompted Introspection: Care

!! Describe a time you cared for someone who was sick, or someone cared for you.

I was sick as a dog last January. Respiratory anything tends to be extra harsh on me.<<ref "c">> It was bad. We had no insurance, money was crazy tight (we went into debt to move), and a doctor would have been useful.<<<ref "m">>

My family took care of me. They did the stuff I normally do. They also got me a humidifier, cough drops (I don't think I could have made it without these), all the OTC drugs!.meme, extra pillows, gave me the only chair-couch-thing in the house (my daughter's) so I could sleep while sitting up. My wife is at a new job and running around like crazy, but she's also stopping by to take care of me too. I was a useless fuck after getting us moved in, and everyone had to throw down to carry my fatass. 

[[JHBFC]], this year has been insane. Please, 2021, slow down for us, especially my wife. She's going to need a way to release this year safely. She's had to keep such an insane pace, fragmented, stretched, tested by crises. It wasn't as depressing and despairing an experience as Milligan, but the amount of effort has been absurd. She needs more chill time (it's gotten better, thankfully). She needs a way to digest this year (even though we've worked to digest on the fly as best we can). She needs space to cry and to lose it safely. She's got a sleep debt (though her sleeping has improved since 2019), strong physical manifestations of anxiety (I would argue these are worse), and she's cannibalized herself to make spoons (too many people rely upon her). How many times have we had to look at each other and say, "we're going to make it," lmao. She's been superwoman this year, again. She's a beast in emergencies; degrees of [[k0shiqua]] emerge to survive. She feels the weight of the world differently than she did when I first met her; she has a different sense of responsibility.
