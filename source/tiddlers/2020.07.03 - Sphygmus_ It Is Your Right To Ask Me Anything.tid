title: 2020.07.03 - Sphygmus: It Is Your Right To Ask Me Anything

"""
[2:12 AM] robotic_scarab: (that driving instructor prank video was hilarous, lmfao)
[2:14 AM] h0p3: Awww yeah, lol. I like how not a single one of them could escape from their terror for a single moment to realize just how badass she is.
[1:35 PM] h0p3: The systematic manner in which you play Animal Crossing reminds me of Eve Online, but instead of perfect competition, it's for the sake of cooperation.
[1:38 PM] robotic_scarab: yes! there's so many across the internet, but the little niche I hang out in is so generous and has been since the beginning!
[1:39 PM] robotic_scarab: cooperatively sharing all the various collectable items in the game & the crafting recipes & everything else

[8:24 PM] robotic_scarab: so this may or may not be my place or your place but ahh! If kicks was streaming publicly on twitch today, I'm sad I missed it! Next time he streams publicly would you ping me on discord?
[8:24 PM] robotic_scarab: If it was private then :sweat_smile:
[8:25 PM] robotic_scarab: WOW
[8:25 PM] robotic_scarab: ahahaha
[8:25 PM] robotic_scarab: that was in march
[8:25 PM] h0p3: Totally your place. You can ask anything of me.
[8:25 PM] h0p3: I hope he will stream again.
[8:26 PM] robotic_scarab: yes! I wish it had been recorded but maybe the real-time is part of the magic too
