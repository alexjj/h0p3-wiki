*[[RP/DnD/Elysium System Thing]]
** Enjoy.
** I hate your title's face. Glad you have a [[PH]] though.
*[[2020/06/22 -- Antipleonasm Analysis: The Price is Wrong]]
** Why should we think that one's brand is not part of one's identity to some [[dok]]?
*** I think reputation can be crucial in some cases. Obviously, I have radical problems with people who use "brand" language in most cases. Seems worth exploring.
** Yet again, your argument is excellent given what you have.
*[[2020/06/22 -- Prompted Introspection: More Popular When You're Dead]]
** What does evil-twin [[j3d1h]] do?
*** Pshaw, committin(apostrophe) tax evasion does sound pretty sinister to me.
** Making a difference, even one that no one else can see, sounds like a dialectical legacy to me.
*** Can part of you, even the effects of you, be remembered even if your name is erased?
**** I'm excited to get back to [[Saint Hegel]] in [[Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση]]. He also has another possible route in idealism (if we take him the Nth degree in OOO) for claiming that a mind might be remembering what it has sublated (given another huge assumption that everything is mind [yeah, I probably use parentheses more often when I'm talking about Hegel than other folks]).
*[[Walking With Monsters: Life Before Dinosaurs]]
** This is very clearly something your mother loves. 
** Your notes are cute.
*** I don't know why it's cute. It's an impression and a feeling. It's one of your styles of meming. 
*[[2020.06.22 - YTDL: Uuuu]]
** I like how much fun stuff this is packed with. I'm glad you have energy for fun things, lol. Continue planning and doing, my love.
*[[2020/06/22 -- Wiki Log: Good Start]]
** What is your style?
*** I'm woefully ignorant on the topic of styles, as you know.
**** I think it's good that your style can change, that you can have many, etc.
*** What does it mean for him to go for a style too quickly? What are the necessary preconditions?
**** Why is style not a skill? Your argument is terrible....Your argument is still terrible.
** I feel like you have something to gain from watching others learn and even teaching them.
*** The see one, do one, teach one rule continues to make sense of a qualia problem. 
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** [[Battle Body(?) Log]] without pictures makes the most sense to me, at least for the public side of your wiki.
*** Or just make it private.
*** I'm glad we did this. I can imagine that without any standard peer pressures to conform to a particular appearance, this wasn't easy to find motivation for. You resisted significantly (still do sometimes). 
**** You still thinking about how to set up your room to make this easy?
** Your work these days shines in comparison. You aren't wet-noodling on me, forcing me to drag you as much up the mountain. I am grateful that you have started to climb without so much intervention.
