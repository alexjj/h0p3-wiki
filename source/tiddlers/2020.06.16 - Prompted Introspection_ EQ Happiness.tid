title: 2020.06.16 - Prompted Introspection: EQ Happiness

!! What is something that made your father happy?

I'm a mammal who likes symmetry. I've added this question to match [[2020.06.15 - Prompted Introspection: Salad Days]]. 

[[MWF]] enjoys Everquest. Most people have no idea what addictive gameplay is like, nor could they appreciate the difficulty of being excellent in EQ. He does though. He's solid at theorizing about it too.

He plays it oddly. It's a tool for engaging in the diffuse mode of reasoning for him. He enjoys botting, trying out wild private servers that completely change the nature of the game, using the frame as a mere engine. He models in it. I think it is like a microcosm of the world for him in a way. 

I have no idea if he still engages in it, but it's a game that has held his attention for a very long time.
