Why should we think Really Important Decisions require abandoning usual norms of openness, transparency, cooperation, collaboration, impartial discussion, basic honesty, etc.?

The only war is class war, sure. Here's an intersectional point: you should openly recognize the fact the vast majority of The Boomers have lazily voted with their lifetimes to be maliciously ignorant. People who refused to be fittingly political don't deserve benefits, but should pay the prices for their choices. I'm all for saving people from unnecessary suffering, but this is morally necessary given our circumstances. Pull the trigger on those who have sold you out and project their evil onto you. We can't make everyone happy, and we can't save everyone. Who deserves to live and have a chance at being happy? Almost none of your elders (and you can personally take care of the few you've ever met who do). So, let them deal with the consequences of their own actions as much as we can; that is our moral right in this case. What can you do for the future, the unborn, the youngest? Serve those who come after you, not those before you. May the last be first in our computation of [[TOP]]. I agree that mercy increases the odds of conversion, but it isn't merited here alethically or prudentially.
