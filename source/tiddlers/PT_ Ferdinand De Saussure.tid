; 1857-1913: Ferdinand De Saussure

* A language ("langue") is the virtual system possessed by all those who form part of the same speech community.
* "La parole" is the utterances, the texts, that individuals produce and understand making use of the system that is "la langue".
* It is not things, but our conception of things, that are part of our language: schemas in the brain being evoked by certain combinations of sounds.
* A language is a system of signs, each composed of two entirely mental values: "signifier" (sound pattern) and "signified" (concept).
* Each signifier and signified is a value produced by the difference between it and all the other signifiers and signifieds in the system.
* The conjunction of signifier and signified is a sign which is of a positive order, and is concrete rather than abstract.
* Every word or term or unit within the system is connected to an entourage of other units; no linguistic sign exists in isolation.
* The link between a signifier and signified is radically arbitrary; there is no logical connection between them.
* Every element of a language is subject to change, to evolution, but no individual can change it.
*Â Both the mutability and immutability of language result form the arbitrariness of the sign.
* Before language, human thought was an amorphous, indistinct, nebulous mass, a floating realm; and human sound was no different.
* Language and writing are two distinct systems of signs; the second exists for the sole purpose of representing the first.
