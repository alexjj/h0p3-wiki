* Catchup
* Breakfast + Watermelon. Dope.
* Looks like there are still chores to do. Fuck.
* So, we were going to plan for [[urban-survival.tdl]], but that is going on hold. Let's plan another week of school (and more).
** Maybe we wait until July/August?
* Discussion of noise levels while [[k0sh3k]] is sleeping. 
** I am, of course, one of the worst offenders here.
* No walk. What will you do? A game at the table instead. 
** Man, this sucks. One woman's foot just healed, and now the other woman's foot is hurt. 
*** Shifts in chores too here.
