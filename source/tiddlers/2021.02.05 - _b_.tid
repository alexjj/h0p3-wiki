Wishing I had textfiles to read :P. Contemplating what it's like not to be able to read your words again.

It's expensive to unhive and rehive our minds, particularly against [[Memetic Warfare]] parasitism. Corporate astroturfing and tolerance-compliance is not acceptance. The capitalist retains the legal papal right to invoke infallibility at any time, including retroactively, as well as the ability to excommunicate, de-ex-communicate, re-ex-communicate, and de-re-ex-communicate. Is your LARP profitable, even if only as a misdirection? Lord, give me strength to cum as many buckets as possible before mine gets kicked (straight in the dicktaters). Your face is a social construct, and for $10, I will give you my snapshot or make an insta account, just for you. 

[[/b/]]'s orthography is experimental. It quickly fleshes out my slapped together sensibilities, as disgusting as they may be. no tea no shade no pink lemonade. I hope to cultivate dat homo sapience. It is shocking to think people wholesale believe we ought to perceive without judging and that we can even deobjectify dasein. Powerful method, but it doesn't solve the problem.

That [[Hereditary]] movie makes me consider the triangulation, the possibility that grandparents and grandchildren have the same enemy and so forth. I also see the using of offspring as mere means in legacy to create the real monsters down the road, the fighting to prevent this.
