title: 2020.10.14 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Scoop Peanutbutter Out With Fingers

More {[[Dreams]]}. I'm glad to have the chance. The day was awesome. 

* Read+Write
* AFireman Time! x3
* Read+LoL
* Sleep by 6:30
* Am I growing allergic to dairy? Fuck me. Please, no!!
** Belly not so good. Two attempts at shitting before my belly settled. It had that food poisoning smell that I know (I can't drink Brandy either, can't even smell it anymore without wanting to puke because of that one time).
*** I remember [[j3d1h]]'s rotavirus too. It was insane. God, I'm so glad I went to work while she took care of the room covered in it. 
**** This 1.5yo kid trailed it everywhere and into our bed too. The stench haunts me.
* Woke at noon
** Groggy. Fuck. You know, my previous night was so good, I just can't complain. One night of damn good sleep every 7 days is something to be happy about for a retard like me.
* [[Morning Routine]]
** We aren't even going hard on weight training, but I'm wondering if it would be wise to go for a break. It's not like I've not worked so hard that my muscles bruised (visibly). I'm not there, but I can see that the threshold might be lowering.
* [[k0sh3k]], for the 4th day in a row, has zinged the bejeezus out of me. It's not fair to wrestle with her when she has such a thorough understanding of how to fuck with me: I'm too verbally retarded to fight back.
** She's mean. And, officially, her dominatrix name is: [[Miss Direction]]. 
* Walk With Offspring
** We talked about attraction (my son began the walk asking about what qualities to seek in a woman, a topic we've talked about for years).
*** My daughter, of course, quickly injected: "fat, in the right places" XD. yeah, girl, tru dat.
*** Took over half the walk to rabbithole it. I'll spend an hour to answer the question as best as I know how.
**** And, surprisingly, my daughter brought up the wikis here (something we've also discussed many times on this front). The proof is in the pudding. Bingo. You got it, kiddo.<<ref "n">>
*** Speak of the devil: [[The AZN|2020.07.14 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: The global economy is a Ponzi scheme requiring a constant stream of new participants to prop it up.]] popped, but no loot dropped. She's 15lbs rounder. Y u m. Unfortunately, I can't see her bare nipples today.
** Howard and Ellen, a mention of Melania...heard us speaking of Trump since my son was explaining presidential nominations (and we needed to think about how DJT has dismantled much of the government). 
** Saw Alex.
*** His aunt got hurt badly. Hospital. Worried about CV19. Gonna visit her soon enough.
* Conversation didn't end after the walk.
* //The Walk//
** S appears to be hitting on her. Please, go on! I'm in heaven teasing and dreaming here. I totally understand, my dude. She is //liquid sex//.
*** It is a regular argument I've had for well over a decade with the woman. She has no idea how simple the average male brain is: want to fuck. Every single straight male above the age of 16 who has spent more than 10 hours with her has fantasized about her. It's a fact. I know it.<<ref "a">> Finally, more confirmation for her.
**** She's wearing The Dress and her shiny stripper-librarian boots today. I [[hope]] she'll squeeze her breasts against the desk and the books every time the man come around. ^^do it^^ XD. 
** Sherlock has been on the brain. As she explains, she likes [[arrogant]]ly intelligent men who are too honest. //Slut//. 
* Literally Inform the Men!
* Meditation
* Shower of the gods
* //Elementary//
** Unwatchable. But, I'm a huge fan of //Lucky Number Slevin//. Speaking of AZNs: I like how Lucy Liu tells the story of telling the story.
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Used up the last of the cheap steaks, potatoes, sprouts, kiwi, coffee and a ginger beer 
*** I hope we see a sale like that again. I am surprised because meat prices are still up. I should have bought them out. 
**** I know better. I know the rules of shopping at a market. I'm an idiot.
** It's been a very long time since we've seen //South Park//. It's an event they should see. We did.
** Nap in lap, didn't even make it through half the episode.

I'm gonna have to be awake at 8 on Saturday. Will need to attempt to transition the sleep schedule to scoop it up.

"""
I was just thinking about what it would be like if we'd met under different circumstances.
  
See, I think people should only fall in love if there's a great story behind how they met.

You know, seeing as how you have to tell it over and over again.
  
If you and I fell in love, we'd have one hell of a story to tell.
  
Yeah.
  
We'd be at a dinner party and someone would ask, "So, how'd you two meet?" And I'd say, "You tell the story, dear," and you'd say, "No. You tell it better."
