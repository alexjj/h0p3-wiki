title: 2021.03.23 - /b/: A Draft Not Good Enough

Though I do not think I'm obviously morally obligated to continue, it is at least a matter of permissible preference that I hand out disclaimers left and right, Maxwell. That's not acceptable to many people, I realize. I'm going to continue to tell you what I think you need to know about me, especially the parts you won't like. Perhaps I am a dark drongo. Some say that hope is the death of joy. XD.

Well, as long as you know that you are about to tank all social capital, credibility, and trust with anyone who realizes you have willingly associated with me: then, yeah, you go ahead, mail everyone about this retard you know who wants to grab a //**foobar substance of your choice**// with you. XD. Your subscribers who don't reach out to you asking you to call the authorities and ghost me (with a restraining order cherry on top) either don't care about you or actively seek your downfall, sir. Keep records. It's only the way you'll be able to de-gaslight yourself regarding the covert dark-triads in your midst.

I'm finna to keep laying it on the wireline for you, aight?

I'm a mean person sometimes. Extremely mean. There are throats that I verbally slit on this wiki. My opinion is that you aren't comfortable with that. What do you think? You don't have to answer. I'm trying not to drag us into a political discussion (which is damn near impossible with me), but interviewing me is fundamentally political.<<ref "v">> My work crosses lines of "[[civil|2019.11.11 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Civility]]" taste. Most won't stand for it. They'd rather I say nothing than what I do. It can be painful to speak with me, well beyond what is predicted or considered tolerable.

If you do have a disclaimer, I ask that you request people consider speaking anonymously if they reach out to me or publicly post anything with my name or link anywhere. It's not just because I seek to normalize pseudonymity and praise those practices necessary for decentralizing power well (though I do), it's because there are people who must pay a price with me (I will drag their skin into the game),<<ref "a">> and I don't want you catching flak (however unjustified) for that.

You need to know: I will be violent with my words sometimes (though [[I aim]] to be justified when I defect, and, no, epistemic humility does not turn us into more gentle creatures in all cases). Injustice flips my switch, I go from playfully absurd to dead serious instantly. I understand this will incur costs in my relationships. Most people are just going to find me [[toxic]], in the end. Only the brave or the sufficiently innocent should speak with me [[uncovered|Naked]].

Here, I must offer you something I offer to only my dearest friends and family: [[The Ol' Yeller Clause]]. Take this card. `/hands-card-to-you`. It's yours. Sometimes, it's my job to be something like an [[antimeme|http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/antimemetics-division-hub]].

A lot of the third party interpretation is simply integrated directly into the wiki, usually with some digestion too. That makes it an odd object to speak about online. Yes, third-party interpretation can improve our ability to interpret each other. I rely upon my trees and circles of trust in others. 

I'm interested to understand what kind of [[friendship]] you hope to justify and demonstrate (if I am correct about your intention, then I hold it in high regard). I have to admit, I think that if I do my job well, I won't have many friends. My job is to wrestle with people and to teach them how (with what little I know and have). Let me tell you something that makes people really not like me:

I believe the vast majority of humans above the age of 25 do not deserve to live. I shit you not. That is wildly unacceptable to most people; it's simply mean, and it has to be wrong (surely fascist too), of course! What kind of twisted monster would even consider the possibility? [[ridtyawtr]]. That changes how the game has to be played, what it means to put our skin in the game wisely. 

I have to exercise my trust with people remotely that would be hard to explain without having experienced it yourself. I hope in time my moves might make more sense. 

Spillin' like a villain. I sit and wait, a lot. I read garbage all the time. I'm trying to see every person in every person. I have no idea how to be empathic well enough in many respects.

I never stop arguing with anyone, Maxwell. Ask anyone who knows me. It is a chaos to me. Though, I will be quiet and sometimes speak only of pleasant things (and, of course, as much as the loud ones, I cherish a soft, mellow conversation, incredibly so) and sometimes even mere [[Smalltalk]] if I must. I'm always arguing, Maxwell. I don't know what it means well enough. Sometimes it's a dance, sometimes a brawl, sometimes it's a ticklethon. I'm a childish machine here: I'm always arguing. It's exhausting, Maxwell. It's something that I hope will be a source of contentment (yup, I'm happy to be in the same room with you, it's an honor), if not tremendous joy, for both of us. I do care about diversity here, and I come to understand [[The Other]] through difference.

The fact is that I think there are other people who fit the description of //The Drongos// better than me. Consider them first, please.

Maxwell, I'm a man who relies upon his faulty memory and metaphors to understand anything. You remind me of a man I consider as holy as they come: [[DeathOfRobinhood]]. Let me tell you, that is likely much higher praise than you know. Though it may not look like it enough, he is a man to whom I listen extremely carefully ([[WINTCIS]]). Every word (though, quite [[fff]]ingly, as he knows), every sensibility I can muster the courage to interpret. He's extremely serious about what matters most, and he's good at it. I wish everyone could have a glimpse inside his life and perspective as I have. You both have ultra-gentle, highly tolerant, giving perspectives. Most people do not care for how they are portrayed in their interviews with me (perhaps him too, in some respects), but any thorough examination of my hypertext demonstrates that I hold him in extremely high regard. I'm unqualified to say if he's a drongo, but he's a wise man and my big brother, and he's like the King of Khal Drongos to me (and more humble than he would accept, itself a special humility), and I'm convinced every person who knows him is lucky to know him. 

I am not in a rush to be interviewed. I promised a [[Root User]] that I would gladly accept at least one invitation, and I am glad to do so (I'm going to keep trying to be open). Maxwell, I am honored to be able to put my skin in the game with you, on whatever wires there may be too. I think of several other people who deserve an interview far more than I do. I like your reasoning. If you do, I think it makes sense to just work the questions in over time and extract what's salient to you for your work. 

As best I can, I speak with all kinds, Maxwell, even nazis, capitalists, murderers, rapists, pedophiles, egoists, postmodernists, creationists, conspiracy theorists, anons, and more. I speak hate sometimes too, and it's not fun trying to explain to me why I ought not. I'm polarizing. It's my job; I was born for it. Tell me, are there any drongos who say the words "nigger" or "faggot" or "zionist" without shame? I belong with the sinners, lepers, and outsiders. I will preserve their voices and speak on their idealized behalf when they cannot be heard. It's a contrary and maybe a contradiction, somewhere. On this front, [[ASmith]] is a badass, high-functioning hiki I admire, and my uncle [[Charlie]] for that matter too (a man I revere even though he voted for Trump [I tolerate his ignorance as non-malicious.]). I have no intention of allowing anyone to preserve an appearance of neutrality in times of moral crisis. You know what I think the redflags are. You aren't neutral. I admire that you work to respect humans. 

It must be said, [[Tapeda the Dragon]] is worth your time. I cannot say I understand this person well enough, and I'm giving my gut instinct (which may simply not be enough).

[[BDS97]] has quite a voice too. A [[gem]]. We recently talked about that CRDT response.

I feel like their web presence drastically understates and underrepresents them (I have a lot of people in [[FTO]] that merit more volume). To my understanding, these people have rare and high moral-value stories to experience and empathize with. I study the images of them that I can see or imagine. 

I like you. And, my goal is to be convivial and filled with usefulness to you. I have to learn how to do that with each person I encounter. So, how do you learn to trust people, build friendships, and what would you like to see every human (or 80%, or 20%, or even 3%) engage in?

Look, in addition to drongo, and h0p3, and Peace, you will have to call me your fucking idiot sometimes too. It's sometimes the only way I learn how you love me. Dead serious. I hate when I'm stupid, especially when it was up to me. Agonizing. It's my purpose not to be stupid well. Failing sucks.
