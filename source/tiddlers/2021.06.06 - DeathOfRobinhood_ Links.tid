https://www.tetoncam.com/zoom/2020 stands out to me. I'm a fan of snapshots. I'm wondering what an animator like you thinks about something like that. It's gorgeous. For my taste, it belongs in Maymays. 

Thank you for https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59h5aD4bgdY. It is rare that anyone recommends music or poems to me. Lyrics are nearly inaccessible mountains for me to climb as an autist. //Wax Cylinder Sonata// do be hittin. It is very rare that anyone offers me a definition of [[hope]]. //Skywriter// lit up for me. Ran across this quote that might be from the artists:

<<<
Nothing goes away anymore. Everything we type, send, say and do can be recorded and will likely exist in perpetuity. Public discourse is reduced to sound bites, platitudes and slogans. Perhaps there is more pressure on the words we choose than ever before.

The metaphor of the Skywriter addresses this pressure in its many forms. Our main character in Deadhorse is struggling to sort through the voices in her head as she searches to find her own voice in a complicated landscape and culture.

I have no idea what the story is about. I won't argue about the words because I obviously don't understand. I feel better about not understanding the lyrics after [[k0sh3k]] read them; I've asked [[j3d1h]] (and the rest of the family too) for help understanding these words (I'm lucky that my daughter can read where I cannot; it grows more common each day). Plenty of words and phrases stand out to me though! We're all mad men. =).

https://neverwintervault.org/catalog/ib is something I've talked about with my offspring. Thank you. It's a good idea. My daughter made some games in Gamemaker Studio long ago, and I'm hoping my son will consider this tool. It seems right up his alley. We'll see. `/fingers-crossed`.
