how are you doing homo?
Lol
I'm alright. Just ate, so my belly is full. Watching LoLWorlds downstairs with [[5c0ut]] and [[ASK]] while I write.
Been a busy day setting up a room down in here in the garage and getting rid of a vehicle.
Garage kinda looks sane now (for now).
sounds like a productive and busy day
A blessing
My daughter's tongue continues to grow sharper and sharper.
I think I'm just trying to co-exist somedays at this point.
so
my daughter broke up with her boyfriend after i picked her up from school.
using her cell phone in my pickup truck to text him
at her mothers reccomendadion
seconds before we pull into parking lot for singing lessons
i have a bulbbering 11 year old who just dumped a boy?
wtf
That could be awkward.
so i cancel the singing lesson
I could imagine that's the kind of stuff that makes for a good singer though. But, yeah, I hear ya.
man up, do the dad thing. take her home. remind her how much more intelligent and  engaging she is... blah. its 6th grade blah.
rought man.
this wasnt suppose to be a dad thing
Really?
Seems like a fitting dad thing ot me.
I'm sure she is (or will be) glad that you were there for her on this one.
i stopped by dollar general and let her get some ice cream.
we talked alot.
Good.
it was a proud dad moment.
Seems like you had a good day, in that sense.
but not something stoned af [[T-Money]] wanted to deal with.
`/nod`
im just complaining. it was all avoidable if my wife had stayed out of sixth grade drame.
drama
mind you
lol
so yeah.
im in the garage.
I'm completely incompetent in that domain.
lol
Where real men belong, ofc
in a garage?
Aye. Sure.
you spend all your time writing you learn to do that well.,
i spend all my time fixing shit
i got good at it.
lol
kinda simple
has nothing to do with masculinity
i dont think
your a monster in conversation when you need to be.
Naw. I think it's just a comfortable place to be.
That does happen.
i love it. as long as its not directed at me.
=D
i enjoy watching a good toe to toe
Sounds like you enjoy a particular variety of drama then
What projects have you been up to lately?
Screenshot of video attached to message
I have no idea what you are doing there.
drilling and tapping the center of a crankshaft on a small engine for a retainer bolt
Noice
im trying out making videos
I've seen
maybe i should introduce with context
most people have no idea wtf im doing anyway even if i told them
so
lol
i havent posted on social media yet.
Has a manic vibe to it
[[Killcoin]] laughed and asked. how can you do that so high?
lol
Been doing it for so long, I take it.
i guess. i dunno
how high you stay all day?
lol
mabye i should gauge myself first
I've been referred to as a medicinal user.
Very light, but usually some each day.
I'm pretty sensitive to it though
i start heavy each day.
lol
i take anywhere from 2-3 teaspoons of oil as soon as i get up.
which was infused at 8grams per cup. high quality.
makes me almost unsteady on my feet.
take samantha to school.
smoke a joint or a few bowls. shower.  open up shop. do shit for a few hours
eat.
get high. repeate.
until bed.
usually another dose of oil before dinner
sometimes 20-40mg of valum.
I assume you have to do non-trivial tolerance breaks at that.
yeah. i have to stop the oil for a week and clean out.
when i do that its almost not worth smoking it during that period.
but i was a small engine mechanic all thru highschool
the lead mechanic. and summers in college.
did that high af the whole time
lol
i guess just instinct or long enough i could prolly do it with my eyes closed.
i know i make shit look easy sometimes.
but i kinda wanna try to capture some of that on video
i really want a go pro and actually kinda stage some more interesting things.
just goofing around right now.
i have no desire to teach or do those types of videos.
im just being an idot really.
a stoned idiot
im aware of that.
It sounds like a lot of fun.
but i can fix stuff while i am being a stoned idiot
A blessing
so i dunno what that makes me hahaha
less bored when im stoned.
thats what it makes me
should have this mini chopper finished tonight
and be online forsale in the morning
im excited to see how fast it goes.
Gotta be a pleasant feeling
I'm sure you'll make a name for yourself in the area too.
im hiding out bro
everythign i sell is hidden on fb from all my fb friends
im a mf hermit
dollar general and aldis
or walmart but has to be pre 7 am
lol
