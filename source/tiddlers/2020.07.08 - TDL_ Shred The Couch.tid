title: 2020.07.08 - TDL: Shred The Couch

* Rooms
** They must make them normal. I am tired of their bullshit.
*** Should I rip everything out for him?
* We need to shop soon. Tomorrow would be fine.
* I think you should continue to take it easy. Enjoy.
* Haven't walked with your wife in a while.
* Take that hypernormalization one step at a time. 
** Vodka. May your farts shred the couch.
