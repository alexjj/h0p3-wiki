title: 2022.12.21 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Spoons

Phased in and out until Susan woke me at 6:30 with a call. She figured out she woke me and ended the call. Mi amor was up. Saw her off. Tried to sleep again, and I think got a wink or two. Up by 8 something. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time!<<ref "m">> 

Saw [[5c0ut]] and [[j3d1h]] chillin'. He gets to see the messages and notes of his boss (man forwards all mail to him as well), and that gives him a lot of information about his other boss Toby (who is clearly a pile of shit). Surviving.

[[TTTOTW]], though, surprisingly, I didn't do much writing at all today. Chat with [[Ignota]]. Went to see Susan with [[ASK]] and [[5c0ut]], but she told us to go away after a minute. Wanted to go the hospital, but refused anything to do with ambulances (I am a person of doubt, at this point; and, the legal liabilities of being a good samaritan are unfortunate). 

Shopping @ W-Entity with my sympaticon. Foodstuffs for her. We also had chicken and wedges. Cold out.

Went to bed: all out of spoons.

4 games with my daughter, and she destroyed me in all of them, +1, +0, -0, -1. My son played one with me, and humility pwned (I actually have to build against that now).

Mi amor called. Long ass day. Two hours at a social event where they forgot again to have anything without dairy, but she had coke. Must be weird hearing boomers say they are proud of you. Mi amor relieves the pressure on SZ, even when I think it's unfair to mi amor.

//Raw Skintime// + Tiktoks with mi amor. 

[[Family Gathering]] was good. We had fish sticks, tater tots, a salad with the fancy greens, and I had a ginger ale too. Finished off //No Country For Old Men//. Normally, I think the attempt to pass messages by speaking about our dreams lacks sincerity, but not in this case. I think it might be different now that I am an old man. Wasn't a waste of our time, thankfully. Async chat with [[GB]].

Hugs'n'bugs with folks for the night. [[TTTOTW]]. Sleep by 9?
