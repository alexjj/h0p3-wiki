Tell me why I got banned of Discord of the leftist society?

I was merely operating under the influence of my passions, as I am suffering from people in high places that are so bigoted and unwilling to see the difference. I am moved personally by the events of my own life. I have a story that I am trying to voice out. Fighting a private battle that no one knows about and it’s even dreadful to know no one will hear because of the fact that no one seems to pay any mind.

I was looking through your account, and I noticed the last thing you wrote, 48 minutes ago, "Hi, I am responding to you because I seem interested..." does not show up for me in the link to the thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/w41u7o/tell_me_why_i_got_banned_of_discord_of_the/).

That might be a type of shadowban there.

Were you speaking to me there? If so, let's move to infrastructure that we own more than our reddit accounts.

I think Tox is an excellent tool (and it can be routed over Tor, if you prefer): https://tox.chat/

[[Leonardo Vadisirisak]]:

Why is Reddit not enough?

That all seems kind sketchy. If you don’t mind me, I prefer talking over Reddit

I don’t trust the internet these days.

[[h0p3]]:

Well, I speak from my ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱, even while chatting here.

I don't trust much of the internet myself either, which is why I made the request.

[[Leonardo Vadisirisak]]:

Mmm I don’t have tor though. But how about we talk here.

[[h0p3]]:

You can get Tor, and Tox. I'm also happy to speak over e-mail.

The fact is that we don't own the means of production here.

But, yes, I'll speak here.

And, why I think Reddit isn't enough is detailed in plenty of places in my ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱.

> Hi, I am responding to you because I seem interested. 
Do you only seem it? That's an interesting way to phrase it.

[[Leonardo Vadisirisak]]:

Because … I am deeply paranoid. I feel like the government is huge and that it will do things, -all in its power to cover things up. Peoples names on Reddit seems to coincidental to be mere names, but signs to myself.

Okay, not so deeply

But like it sparks suspicion

[[h0p3]]:

> That all seems kind sketchy. 
Let's be clear, your account is quite sketchy. Being unwilling to use proper tools for communicating with me is also sketchy.

I suggest reading about the tools I've suggested to you. I'm quite paranoid myself.

[[Leonardo Vadisirisak]]:

I have. But it just didn’t sit well with me. I just don’t get it? But philosophy and all those things, I kind of get you I guess. You must be a deep person, am I right? Full of spirit and intellectualism. There is still a barrier, but I do things that I think are mainstream esotericism.

[[h0p3]]:

This discussion we are having is plaintext on Reddit's servers. I have little doubt that the partially Chinese owned Conde Naste (parent company of Reddit) and the US government have access to this chat, if they wanted, even if only as a passive dragment.

I don't think you have.

Not significantly.

I can appreciate that it doesn't sit well with you. That's part of being paranoid.

dragnet*

If you want a private conversation, even from governments, you should take steps to do so.

[[Leonardo Vadisirisak]]:

I think that is impossible irregardless

Not with the things that I know.

[[h0p3]]:

> Peoples names on Reddit seems to coincidental to be mere names, but signs to myself.

That sounds like schizophrenia. `/nod`.

[[Leonardo Vadisirisak]]:

No. You don’t get what I experience that’s why

[[h0p3]]:

> I think that is impossible irregardless
Why do you think it is impossible? Please give me a technical set of reasons.

[[Leonardo Vadisirisak]]:

Because like.. it is somewhat telepathic.

And whatever means that I can’t describe. Far beyond the realms of my imagination

[[h0p3]]:

Surely, you can appreciate how I'm not convinced you are telling the truth, nor do I take it as a good sign that you've [not] even tried to respect my [[privacy]] here.

Perhaps you feel you are though.

That might be part of the delusion.

[[Leonardo Vadisirisak]]:

You just haven’t witnessed what I saw. They were reciprocating things with me.

It’s just that, I don’t trust you yet. I shouldn’t be a sucker for someone that I don’t know right?

[[h0p3]]:

I can appreciate that we have different [[phenomenologies]].

Naw. The tools I'm pointing [you to] require the least amount of trust.

[[Leonardo Vadisirisak]]:

I am deeply afraid of scammers and all of that stuff because of what happened in the past(personal story, apart from what I’m talking about).

[[h0p3]]:

Acting like Reddit is the place to be for safety is delusional and ignorant here.

I can appreciate being afraid of scammers.

[[Leonardo Vadisirisak]]:

How about exchanging emails then.

[[h0p3]]:

I already sent you the link. Within [the contents of the page from] that [[link]] is my e-mail: h0p3@protonmail.com

[[Leonardo Vadisirisak]]:

I have sent you a email. Did you receive it?

[[h0p3]]:

Here is what I said, "You may wish to use a protonmail account, which enables clientside public key crypto. Currently, our e-mails are still being sent plaintext."
<<<

; Hello.

> Let us start here.

You may wish to use a protonmail account, which enables clientside public key crypto. Currently, our e-mails are still being sent plaintext.

> I do not understand what plaintext is, how is it bad thing?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintext

Our communications still aren't E2EE (End-to-end encrypted). Anyone who has access to your e-mail server can still read [[these words|ITS]]. We could encrypt our messages by hand and decrypt them by hand on our own machines, or we could let protonmail do the work for us.

> I just made a email with proton. I will send a message.

; There.

> Should be okay now. 

`/salute​`. There we go. I appreciate that, sir. Thank you.

> "But what can you really do for me though?"

Perhaps not much. I know when I'm feeling paranoid, it's easy to isolate myself. I could imagine you are sometimes lonely. I can listen. I can be a person to talk to. Some people find my company worthwhile, and you might as well. I am convinced that I can help you secure your computing more, and that's not nothing.

> "What is the extent of your ability?"

I've a background in academic philosophy, religion, and computing. I'm nobody though. Just a human.

> "I reached to many others in the past and they all yielded the same result. Nothing ever happens. I am trapped and everyone reacts just like you."

I may have some thing in commons with others here. We'll see.

Do you identify with this? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gang_stalking

I'm currently reading through your twitter account as well. Do you have any other [[Public Self-Model]]s for me to consider?

> You read through my Twitter? Sounds ominous and somewhat relieving. Gang talking with psi-electronics is truly what I’m implying. 

Aye. I'm reading through it. I'm trying to listen to your story, and that's where you've said it out loud so far, at least as far as I can see. 

> I don’t go on any other social media but Twitter to rant and stuff. 

Well, I'm [[hoping]] you can provide a long version of the story for me. 

I ask you to read what I have to say at least twice. I try to read and write carefully (though there's plenty of mistakes). I know this is an emotional topic, so I think it's important to step back and think carefully about it.

> Wow, it is such a long-story. Started at 2016 of summer vacation. Damn, I pretty wasted my breath on my Twitter and other places by trying to fight back against the PSY-electronics that are in my head. Like, it is all due to how I feel chemically I suppose. When I feel like I’m stressed out, I legitimately feel like I’m stressed out and that it is insufferable, like psychologically horrible like tormentful. But recently, I am able to distinguish apart the sensation, like it feels healthier now somewhat, and I think it is partially due to them. Here and there I have face insults and prejudism. But this didn’t always happen. I was being neglected, left behind no context or whatever, but still weird things were happening to me. Beginning of January 2021. Everything was horrible. I couldn’t sleep, and they kept me up late. My instincts were driven mad and I was also ignorant, like I didn’t know anything, so it was dreadful and I thought that they were going to provide some succor but it didn’t happen. It made me so extreme that I did things that were not normal. Then I went back to school and for some reason it all died down. Tbh, they were kind of my confidants in many ways and I wanted to go back to how things were before my incident into the hospital. I was at peace for the rest of the semester, then somewhere during the summer, it had occurred again. I was arguing with the people in my head. They may have planted some sort of loop of voices constantly insulting me and shit, it was hard to make out, but when I did try to, -I argued against them. I forgot if they kept me up late again. Like they appeared coherently in my head before in the past(2016 of fall semester) imitating voices that I’m familiar with and I’m wondering why they couldn’t do it again. They also caused a minor incident with my neighbors by pushing me over the edge. Also, It is a funny story but back in Jan. 2021, I literally heard Greedo from Star Wars in my head. Like I was pissed. They can do all that shit negligently, but can’t seemed to be more straightforward.

> "Damn, I pretty wasted my breath on my Twitter and other places by trying to fight back against the PSY-electronics that are in my head. Like, it is all due to how I feel chemically I suppose."

`/nod`. I think that is largely true. Many of those sensations and experiences are constructed by your own mind. Let me be clear: I am not doubting that you are experiencing what you are experiencing. You are hearing and seeing what you claim. I believe you there. But, I doubt what has caused you to have those sensations and feelings. Those chemicals and electrical signals in your brain can cause you to artificially hear voices or see things that don't exist outside your mind. To be clear, those experiences may feel just as concrete and "real" as anything else, even though they are caused by a malfunction in your brain.  

You have auditory hallucinations, and I've had one before (it was spooky AF, and I didn't even know it was a hallucination at first). It sounds like you've got some very negative voices imposed into your [[phenomenology]], and that has to be a serious source of suffering. That's not your fault either. My friend [[The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum]] suffers something similar. It's important to continue using medications prescribed by your doctor to help you deal with those feelings and experiences; they may have to try several options to find something that works for you. I know it's hard to find people who you can trust. Do you have any family that you trust to help you?

> "When I feel like I’m stressed out, I legitimately feel like I’m stressed out and that it is insufferable, like psychologically horrible like tormentful."

Yeah. I hear that. It can snowball, get out of control even. I could imagine that an awful day or a reminder of some other event might trigger more hallucinations. Sounds like one helluva fight. I'm sorry.

> "But recently, I am able to distinguish apart the sensation, like it feels healthier now somewhat, and I think it is partially due to them. Here and there I have face insults and prejudism.

What was the minor incident? Do you hope to avoid having incidents like that again?

> "Also, It is a funny story but back in Jan. 2021, I literally heard Greedo from Star Wars in my head."

That is kinda funny. I think I would have been quite surprised to hear that. Did you quote any Han Solo lines back to the voice generated by your brain?

> "Like I was pissed. They can do all that shit negligently, but can’t seemed to be more straightforward."

I can appreciate being angry about your situation. You didn't choose to have these voices in your head. You are probably genetically pre-disposed to hallucinating (it runs in my family). I also suggest that you've been thinking about how much evil there is in the world, recognizing how power is often abused, and you're right to be angry about that. So, for example, I will agree to the claim that the US government is often not to be trusted and that surveillance is a profound threat to democracy. I would also agree that the most [[power]]ful people in the world are psychopaths. However, I do not agree that these forces are the cause of those voices in your mind. It's a not a choice that anyone in the world is making to impose those experiences in your mind, although it's possible that you can stop it with medication. I can imagine it's scary not having an immediate answer to it. A solution may take a lot of time and effort.

Unfortunately, I've gotta log off, sir. I will think about anything you say to me. I [[aim]] to be a thorough interlocutor. I need some sleep first though. It's after 4am here in New England. TTYL, homie.

> *sigh* you all say the same thing in the end. I bet you’re like a spy or something. Makes me even despair that my truths will not even mean a thing. I don’t have schizophrenia or any delusional disorder. I know I can clear up any physiological disorders, but psychologically(chemically) there is nothing I can do.  I know what I saw and I know what I’m going through. You might not even consider the possibilities without seeing it through my points of views first. It happened in a small place anyways and I don’t expect you to believe me. Fucked up world we live in. Sometimes I like to imagine myself young again and free. Now I got this weird thing going on in my head that feels unsobering. I can even try to tell you my story but I don’t think that you can do much to research much deep into it. 

''''

> "*sigh* you all say the same thing in the end."

Surely, there are some significant differences. I don't think you've even looked for those differences in me or our discourse yet. I am just as neurodivergent as you are, my friend.

> "I bet you’re like a spy or something."

I am someone who pays close attentions to [[others]]. [[Instrume]] accuses me of essentially being a Glowy Artistic Researcher. I'm not paid to do my work. I also argue vehemently (take a look) against immoral government surveillance and [[Memetic Warfare]]. Ironically, I did consider joining such agencies to try and [[change]] them from the inside, but I learned that would be a fool's errand.

> "Makes me even despair that my truths will not even mean a thing."

They mean something, if they don't mean or have the consequences you want them to. I appreciate your despair. [[Hope]] is sometimes all we have.

> "I don’t have schizophrenia or any delusional disorder."

It must be extremely lonely to have so many people disagree with you here. I will continue to respectfully listen and respond despite our disagreement. 

> "I know I can clear up any physiological disorders, but psychologically(chemically) there is nothing I can do."

It seems like this may contradict your previous claim. Regardless, there is a significant [[chance]] that even if you do everything that can be done, you won't find solace or healing. I'm sorry, friend. That doesn't make us [[power]]less to try to solve it, but I recognize the odds of success may be low. I work on projects with much lower odds of success. Our lives matter.

> "I know what I saw and I know what I’m going through. You might not even consider the possibilities without seeing it through my points of views first."

Right back at you, bud. I know what I've seen and I know what I'm going through. My evidence shows there's no such thing as telepathy, even if my point of view does support the belief in surveillance and spies. I have considered the possibilities you've provided me, and I've provided evidence of that as well. I even linked you to the name of your condition (which you seemed not to know). I'm aware of at least some of the cluster of delusions you suffer from. I'm trying to help you peel apart fact from fiction here. So, please consider trying to do the same for me: take a walk in my shoes and see from my point of view. From what I gather, you didn't even look at what I've sent you, and you've avoided responding to the points I've made. If you expect me to proactively look through your stories to understand your point of view, then it's fair for me to expect the same of you.

> "It happened in a small place anyways and I don’t expect you to believe me."

I think part of you does expect me to believe you, even if you don't predict I will. I'm doing what I can to build a bridge with you.

> "Fucked up world we live in."

Indeed, it is a fucked up world we live in. I am a student of Humanity and the evil of our species.

> "Sometimes I like to imagine myself young again and free. Now I got this weird thing going on in my head that feels unsobering.""

The onset of schizophrenia is often in one's 20s. I hope it is a prison you can escape from, sir.

> "I can even try to tell you my story but I don’t think that you can do much to research much deep into it."

There are parts of your story that I can {[[verify]]}. I don't think paranoia is completely unjustified. I don't agree with all of your story, but surely some is better than none. If all you're seeking is someone to rubberstamp validate your perspective, then you'll be disappointed with me, as I mentioned. If you're looking for more than an echo chamber or a mirror, and you can tolerate our disagreement, then I may be more useful to you. I'm not throwing you away because I think you suffer from delusions. I would be a tangled mess in your shoes too. I [[hope]] you'll continue telling me your story and connecting.

Tell me about your life. What's it like?
