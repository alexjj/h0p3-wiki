**** this 9yo 4channer, chili, is literally my idol, and I did reach out to him:
***** h0p3: "Made me laugh hard today, [[anon]] chili. I hope you keep up the good work. It's absolutely legendary. Leaving my card for ya, https://philosopher.life/#Names%20of%20the%20Micro%2Fb%2Fenis." 
***** chili: "Lol Ty"
***** his ~~brother~~ [[sister|https://www.reddit.com/user/being_inso]] is [[watching out|https://www.reddit.com/r/domesticviolence/comments/ntdn6b/how_do_i_acclimate_the_kids_to_the_concept_that/]] for him. 
****** h0p3: "Just stopped by to thank your brother for providing me a great laugh. I can see he's been through some shit. You're doing a great job being there for him, and it can't be easy given how obviously intelligent he is. I could only hope to be as good of a big brother as you are. You ever need something, [HMU](philosopher.life/#Contact%20h0p3)."
****** being_inso: "ty! yeah our family has seen some shit, but maybe thats what makes him so smart. ill me sure to write your card down!"
