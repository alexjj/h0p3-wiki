How's your week been, sir?

How's it going?
Jul 17 1:03pm
Pretty good. How are you guys doing?
Jul 17 1:04pm
We're hanging in there. Offspring haven't been doing their schoolwork this week, so that's been stressful. I'm gonna keep trying to find a way with 'em. Everyone's in good health though. Drinking my coffee right now, probably going to blazeit here soon.
Jul 17 1:05pm
Sweet ...im glad everyone is healthy. I'm sure the kids will hit their stride. Things are on an uptick with covid-19 here. Mandatory masks everywhere
Jul 17 1:08pm
I heard it's fucking crazy over there.
Jul 17 1:08pm
Yeah it's pretty wild
Jul 17 1:08pm
Is your family doing okay?
Jul 17 1:09pm
(I am grateful that your granddaughter and my offspring are almost immune. Blessings of youth.)

Family is doing great. Son's getting married in October. She's with child now. About six weeks. Hope things go okay. She lost the first one. I'm really grateful that our kids and grandkids are young
Jul 17 1:10pm
Dude! Congratulations!
Jul 17 1:11pm
I'm sorry to hear about the loss, but it would be awesome to have two.
Jul 17 1:11pm
That's amazing news in dark times.
Jul 17 1:12pm
Yeah I'm tickled with it I think that's a blessing in disguise. Hopefully all will go well. These are troubling times poor people who love each other and are different races unfortunately. It's really sad and unfathomable that someone looks at that as something to demean someone

How are you feeling about the people in your lives, community? When you put your ear to the ground, what do you hear?
Jul 17 1:18pm
It's crazy here. Some typical rednecks...most people are decent. Or seem to be. Just different in a small town. Seems to be on edge
