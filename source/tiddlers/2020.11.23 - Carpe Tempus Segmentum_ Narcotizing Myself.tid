title: 2020.11.23 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Narcotizing Myself

* Family just chillin'...
* My wife is clearly hawt for an author: Jennifer Wright.<<ref "w">>
** She's roaring laughing, mirin' that dope sense of humor. 
* Everyone went back to hikikiing-out.
* Read+Write+Walk+Talk
* AFireman Time!
* Cleaning
* Ate the last piece of roast
** We made almost just enough. We're getting better at this.
** My wife could smell it from upstairs. How? It wasn't heated. She must be a wizard.
* //Venture Bros// until sleep by 5?
* Woke at 1
** Refreshed.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* //Skintime//
** SZ told her to get to PTO. 
*** My wife continues to sacrifice more than she has to. We are all lucky and grateful.
*** Vacation is dope.
* Inform the Men!
* Meditation
* Shower of the gods!
** One of my favorite parts of our showers is that I will say the most dirty, awful things I can possibly conceive and blaspheme.<<ref "p">> Like deep spit-kissing, it's a cleansing experience. Plus, my wife's cursed-ability-compulsion to visualize everything she hears in vivid detail (literally cannot stop herself) makes it amazing. 
*** She really loves me.
* Pasta with offspring
* [[MTG]]
** Son's Affinity +1 vs MWC (open-handed on my end), kept a 1-lander with 4 STP/PTE. He missed a lot of little things (still would have lived through it even if he played perfectly via pulsing), but Ravager finally became [[power]]ful to him. Instant-speed equip shenanigans he saw. WoG into nudging his Blinkmoth activation with Humility (bye bye birdie) into Austere of the entire board. 
*** Walked through cards and thinking about overextenders. Simple and beautiful. Explained why I thought Skullclamp, Plating, and Ravager were fundamental to this matchup.
** Son's MWC vs Affinity, he plays well from what I see (though Ravager needed to eat it), top and sheets wisely, digging for austere, mazing (eventually softlocked by them), etc. Skullclamp allows me to accelerate my board position quickly despite the removal; like riding a knife's edge into a two-shot (Revealed Disciple, and game) 2 turns before Austere. 
*** He's been working on his enunciation with his deeper, open-throated voice. There is so much that goes into being careful with our words.
* Garbage.TV+Read+Write
* It's getting fucking dark by 5. Everyone seems to be feeling sleepy by a mere sign. 
* Daughter does not want help with dinner, and my son passes for that reason too.
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Fish, stirfry veggies, rice, coffee
** [[MTG]]
*** Wife Paci +2 vs Dredge, she scoops before she should, demoralized by Iona on white with wrong scepter call. I therapy'd the turn before she topped the scepter (for it). Moment's Peaces were going to keep it real close.
*** Daughter's Affinity vs Son's MWC. I still don't see a deck she enjoys piloting. Affinity has been this romantic dream of hers, but she's sometimes just not aggressive and risky enough with it to have it blossom in her hands. Years of this. Not a good sign.
**** She did wisely mull though. She did abuse Skullclamp. It may still blossom for her.
* Read+Write+Walk+Talk
* A dispute between my offspring: dad becomes referee, then the gift of waiting to solve it until tomorrow arrives, cooler heads.
** Talked about [[???]] and teaching me to RP as they do. 
** More about [[games]] and story-telling in general; my daughter graciously put me on a timer.
*** I like that she negotiates with me. 
* Vapelyfe
* Read+Write+Walk+Talk

May we learn to play with the cards we got. Even on the assumption of positivism, our Grounds of All Being always shine through who we are; it is a mix of the highest treasures we pick out and don't.

Probably too creepy though (never stopped me befo' tho'). Basically, what I'm saying is: [[my wife]] wants to have sex with your ideas. Gotdamn that is hawt!">>
