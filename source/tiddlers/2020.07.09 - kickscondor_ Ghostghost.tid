//Honestly answering as honestly as I can. I never realized I needed answers to these important questions so quickly.//

# Do you believe in ghosts?
#* I don't know what consists in a ghost. Normally I believe in ideas, but there's something interesting about believing in things too. I believe in something spooky about the world, metaphysics, but I do not understand it well enough. I will agree that for us to perceive anything at all, part of us must be metaphysical. I hesitate to call that a belief in ghosts.
# If there’s thunder and loads of rain, does a ghost get wet?
#* Is there ghostthunder and ghostrain in the ghostland? I like the idea of ghosts getting wet, of course.
# Can it get hit by lightening?
#* Can a ghost get hit by "a drop in the level of the uterus during the last weeks of pregnancy as the head of the fetus engages in the pelvis"? I don't understand the rules of ghosts well enough, but I wouldn't be surprised if there weren't at least some possible world in which a ghost-uterus could hit a ghost. At the very least, some ghost's uterus is hitting the pregananant host.
# If the wind is strong, does it blow away?
#* Depends on the type of wind. I assume 200mph ghostwind will blow many ghosts away.
# Can a ghost breath underwater?
#* It's unclear to me if ghosts breathe. Maybe some do breathe, but because they appear to be projections in our world, it's not clear that any of our material is breathable for them at all. Maybe they are breathing in their dimension though, and it just doesn't matter whether they are under our water or not. But, can they breath under ghostwater? Well, it depends if the ghost is amphibious, has gills, or even a ghost rebreather, right? What I'm saying is: it depends on the modality of "can" here.
# Are there human ghosts underwater?
#* I don't know. Underwater where? There are possible worlds where human ghosts are underwater.
# Do monkeys have ghosts?
#* In some cases, sure. I don't believe they do in our world.
# Do birds have ghosts?
#* As pets? Some of the corvids just might be intelligent enough to harness ghosts like this. Can they touch each other remotely? What signs can they use to be there with each other? 
# Do bird ghosts get wet in rain or blow away in strong wind?
#* More counterfactuals here. If there were bird ghosts in the ghostrain and ghostwind, presumably ghostso. 
# Do cows have ghosts?
#* Do ghosts only emerge from sufficiently sentient creatures? I don't know. 
#* The Google tells me they are real tho, so maybe.
# Could you have a cow ghost underwater?
#* It seems as though I can't. I don't own cows, and I've never seen a ghost either. But, there's always [[hope]] for tomorrow.
# Do fish have ghosts?
#* Some probably keep them in ghosttanks filled with ghostwater and colorful lights. 
# Why don’t we see fish ghosts on dry land?
#* Because we can't see ghosts that don't exist unless we are hallucinating. I guess people don't hallucinate this one, and that's why we don't see them. 
# Can ghosts go on holiday?
#* Their existence seems like a holiday to me. I don't know enough about various ghostcultures to answer. Presumably, some ghosts go on ghostholidays. 
# If a fish died in a fish bowl, and then the fish bowl is moved, does the fish ghost haunt the area where the fish bowl was even if there isn’t any water?
#* This is a great question. What is the ghostanchorpoint? Okay, so let's assume we're traveling through the physical universe at tremendous speeds, swirling in our galaxies. Is the ghostanchorpoint subject to inertia and relativity of the physical world? This be a stumper.
# Can you spray paint a ghost?
#* I don't know, can I? 
#** Probably not without some dope ghosttech.
# If you spray a ghosts with stinky perfume will it smell?
#* But, if I can't spray them with paint, why should I think I'd be able to spray them with perfume? Depends on our ghosttech here.
#* If a ghosts got all perfumated, would it smell stinky to me? Would it smell stinky to itself? Do ghosts even have the sense of smell, and is it like mine? Are we spraying ghoststank?
# What happens if two ghosts try to run through each other?
#* Are they ghosts of the same ghostdimension playing by the same ghostrules? I want to see ghosts bump and grind.
# If you blow dry a ghost does it go fluffy?
#* It depends on the ghost and the blow-drying mechanism. Imagine a ghost-bustery converter tool that I could hold in my hand that could influence ghostair dynamics. Maybe some of those ghosts could become "go fluffy." 
# Do you believe in ghosts?
#* This question is melting my brain. 
#* I wonder if this question is a ghost. It's haunting me. Question 20, are you a ghostquestion?
