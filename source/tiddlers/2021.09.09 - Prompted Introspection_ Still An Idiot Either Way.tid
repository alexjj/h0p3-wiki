title: 2021.09.09 - Prompted Introspection: Still An Idiot Either Way

!! On planet A, everyone's 30% dumber and you're a genius by comparison. On planet B, everyone's 30% smarter and you're an idiot by comparison. You stay the same. Which planet would you prefer to live on?

Let's set aside the percentages, as this doesn't do the work you think it does here. I get the gist. Therefore, I identify as this question, in and of itself as a thing-in-itself for itself.<<ref "XD">> As this question, I an am a idiot, as it were, so surely I should know what to pick here.

It depends on how you want to define intelligence. I am, of course, your retard, Samwise.<<ref "r">> If you mean some positivistic measurement of inferentialism (sorry Brandom) and valueless abstraction optimization, a mere computer,<<ref "pb">> then I do not feel confident answering the question. I am worried about nature selecting for increasingly "intelligent" sociopaths. I have to choose one though, right? All else being equal, prima facie, I prefer the computationally more intelligent species. I want us to be wise, and that is an influential factor; barring that, perhaps it's at least accelerationist.<<ref "ts">>

I don't know how it would be different for me or anyone else. I'm already an idiot, and I can't see what that world looks like. As you know, I already have some baskets without marbles in them,<<ref "b">> but if you made it so that, by comparison, all of my baskets were nearly empty, I presume so many of the problems that I'm worried about would be out of my hands, better solved by much greater minds (thank the maker, sweet, blessed relief). With no likely [[change]] in the efficacy of my autonomy (despite a radical shift in my responsibility), I could only imagine they would allow me to do what I do now anyway:<<ref "p">> worship at the altar of my [[monster]], mutter and reeeeeeeee to myself like a madman, form [[FTO]] alliances against The Man, smearscrawl shit on every surface I can find ([[ITS]]),<<ref "o">> squeegiggle about very^^tm^^ important things, torture my [[micropenis]] often, and surf my Fisher-Price modeling tools for the deepity answers to my absolutely retarded questions about the world via near real-time public self-vivisection. I would be like this creature trapped in an applesauce pissjugg zoo-museum exhibit, a 4eakshow appliance (don't tap on the glass, but do show him your titties), a reminder to all the good children not to do drugs (not even one whole maryjuwanas,<<ref "m">> or you'll end up just like me). I'm going to be obnoxious comic-relief either way, right?<<ref "l">> 

Boo.

I wish you'd let me pick the world with the most kindness<<ref "a">> (a matter of choice rather than capacity). This question is almost banal, impuissant, or anodyne by comparison.
