<<<
[Stravinsky] is...always studying the unfashionable & the forgotten on its merits; conceding nothing either to sensationalism nor to the demand for novelties; seeking no disciples & listening to all masters; never straining the functions of music nor letting theory outrun practice, nor waiting for genius to manifest itself in his work of its own accord, but thinking of inspiration as a factor in all departments of human activities; not a specialty of the artist alone, & a factor to be set in motion by effort only, & that effort daily work. He sets himself to work as a handicraftsman would do, evolving & constructing no theorizing that is more than a by-product of daily attention to what he feels best qualified to attend to, & cares most about. He gained the more confidence in that method through discovering that all those composers whose super-excellence is recognised worked just so.

-- E. Stuart Bates, //INSIDE OUT: An Introduction to Autobiography//
<<<

<<<
I did not exist to write poems, to preach or to paint, neither I nor anyone else. All of that was incidental. Each man had only one genuine vocation - to find the way to himself. He might end up as poet or madman, as prophet or criminal - that was not his affair, ultimately it was of no concern. His task was to discover his own destiny - not an arbitrary one - & live it out wholly & resolutely within himself. Everything else was only a would-be existence, an attempt at evasion, a flight back into the ideas of the masses, conformity & fear of one's own inwardness. 

-- Herman Hesse

<<<
I put my genius into my life, & only my talent into my art[, i.e. I don't make art of my life].

-- Wilde
<<<

<<<
I carry my ideas with me for a long time, rejecting & rewriting until I am satisfied. Since I am conscious of what I want, I never lose sight of the fundamental idea. It rises higher & higher, until I see the image of it, rounded & complete, standing there before my mental vision.

-- Beethoven
<<<

<<<
In literature we require distinction, charm, beauty & imaginative power. We don't want to be harrowed & disgusted with an account of the doings of the lower orders. 

-- Wilde

<<<
Works of art are of an infinite loneliness and with nothing to be so little reached as with criticism. Only love can grasp and hold and fairly judge them.

-- Rainer Maria Rilke
<<<

<<<
Everything excellent limits us momentarily because we feel unable to match up to it; only in so far as we subsequently accept it into our own culture, absorb it as belonging to our own mental & temperamental powers, do we come to love & value it. 

-- Goethe

<<<
...in my view there's nothing more foolish than to sit down & try to come up with a theme. For that you must arrange your life sensibly. See to it that every day you have at least half an hour for incidental reading...When you go for a walk you must let your thoughts flutter randomly, sniffing here & there, letting them have a go now here, now there. That is how to arrange one's housekeeping. Themata are the accidents that the week should deliver to you in abundance. But the more you see to it that the dividends are uncertain, the freer, better, richer they...will become, & the more striking, surprising, penetrating.

-- Saint Kierkegaard
<<<

<<<
My ideas come as they will, I don't know how, all in a stream. If I like them I keep them in my head, & people say that I often hum them over to myself. Well, if I can hold on to them, they begin to join on to one another, as if they were bits that a pastry-cook should join together in his pantry. And now my soul gets heated, & if nothing disturbs me the piece grows larger & brighter until, however long it is, it is all finished together in my mind, so that I can see it at a glance, as if it were a pretty picture or a pleasing person. Then I don't hear the notes one after another, as they are hereafter to be played, but it is as if in my fancy they were all at once. And that is a blast. While I'm inventing, it all seems to me like a fine vivid dream; but that hearing it all at once (when the invention is done), that's the best. What I once so heard I don't forget again, & perhaps this is the best gift that God has granted me.

Those who have no interest in communication do not become artists; they become mystics or madmen. 

-- W. H. Auden

<<<
This is the main defect with everything human, that it is only through opposition that the object of desire is possessed. I shan't speak of the various syndromes that can keep the psychologist busy (the melancholic has the best-developed sense of humour, the most extravagant person is often the one most prone to the picturesque, the dissolute one often the most moral, the doubter often the most religious), but simply recall that it is through sin that one first catches sight of salvation...

-- Saint Kierkegaard, //Either/Or//

The art of conversation is to be prompt without being stubborn, to refute without argument, & to clothe great matters in a motley garb. 

-- Disraeli

Conversation is a game of circles. In conversation we pluck up the termini which bound the common of silence on every side.

The world has need of a philosophy, or a religion, which will promote life. But in order to promote life it is necessary to value something other than mere life. Life devoted only to life is animal, without any real human value, incapable of preserving man permanently from weariness & the feeling that all is vanity. If life is to be fully human it must serve some end which seems, in some sense, outside human life, some end which is impersonal & above mankind, such as God or truth or beauty. Those who best promote life do not have life for their purpose. They aim rather at what seems like a gradual incarnation, a bringing into our human existence of something eternal, something that appears to imagination to live in a heaven remote from strife & failure & the devouring jaws of Time. Contact with this eternal world - even if it be only a world of our imagining - brings a strength & a fundamental peace which cannot be wholly destroyed by the struggles & apparent failures of our temporal life. It is this happy contemplation of what is eternal that Spinoza calls the intellectual love of God. To those who have once known it, it is the key of wisdom. 

-- Russell

I believe that delight at having understood a very abstract & obscure system leads most people to believe in the truth of what it demonstrates.

Any philosophy that can be put in a nutshell belongs in one.

-- Hilary Putnam

<<<
An aphorism that has been honestly struck cannot be deciphered simply by reading it off; this is only the beginning of the work of interpretation proper, which requires a whole science of hermeneutics. In the third essay of this book I give an example of what I mean by true interpretation: an aphorism stands at the head of that essay, & the body of the essay forms the commentary. One skill is needed - lost today, unfortunately - for the practice of reading as an art: the skill to ruminate, which cows possess but modern man lacks. This is why my writings will, for some time yet, remain difficult to digest.

-- Nietzsche, //The Genealogy of Morals//

Nothing is so useless as a general maxim.

The nobler the truth or sentiment, the less imports the question of authorship.

I must create my own System or be enslaved by another man's.

<<<
The man of knowledge must be able not only to love his enemies but also to hate his friends.

One repays a teacher badly if one remains only a pupil. And why, then, should you not pluck at my laurels?...

You are my believers : but of what importance are all believers?

You had not sought yourselves when you found me. Thus do all believers; therefore all belief is of so little account.

Now I bid you lose me & find yourselves...

-- Nietzsche, //Thus Spake Zarathustra//

<<<
...it is not the sleep of reason that brings forth monsters. It is reason itself, which shows us to be nothing but monsters.

The mighty proposition with which civilisation begins: any custom is better than no custom. 

-- Nietzsche, //Daybreak//
<<<

<<<
You can't think decently if you don't want to hurt yourself.

You cannot write anything about yourself that is more truthful than you yourself are.

Nothing is so difficult as not deceiving oneself.

If anyone is unwilling to descend into himself...he will remain superficial in his writing.

Working in philosophy...is really more a working on oneself.

That man will be revolutionary who can revolutionize himself.

-- Saint Wittgenstein
<<<

<<<
...every man who is devoted to the purely objective contemplation (& it is this that is meant by the knowledge of ideas) completely loses sight of his will, & its objects, & pays no further regard to the interests of his own person, but becomes a pure intelligence free from any admixture of will. 

-- Schopenhauer

Politics is the art of making people indifferent to what should concern them.

The engineering of consent is the very essence of the democratic process.

-- Edward Bernays, //The Engineering of Consent//
<<<

<<<
'Democracy,' in the United States rhetoric refers to a system of governance in which elite elements based in the business community control the state by virtue of their dominance of the private society, while the population observes quietly. So understood, democracy is a system of elite decision and public ratification, as in the United States itself. Correspondingly, popular involvement in the formation of public policy is considered a serious threat. It is not a step towards democracy; rather it constitutes a 'crisis of democracy' that must be overcome.

-- Noam Chomsky, On Power and Ideology

<<<
All conservatives are such from personal defects. 

-- Emerson, //Conduct of Life//
<<<

<<<
Thus corporations finally claimed the full rights enjoyed by individual citizens while being exempted from many of the responsibilities and liabilities of citizenship. Furthermore, in being guaranteed the same right to free speech as individual citizens, they achieved, in the words of Paul Hawken, 'precisely what the Bill of Rights was intended to prevent: domination of public thought and discourse.' The subsequent claim by corporations that they have the same right as any individual to influence the government in their own interest pits the individual citizen against the vast financial and communications resources of the corporation and mocks the constitutional intent that all citizens have an equal voice in the political debates surrounding important issues.

-- David C. Korten, //When Corporations Rule the World//
