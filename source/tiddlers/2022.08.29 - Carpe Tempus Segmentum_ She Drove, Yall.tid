<<<
[[TTTOTW]]. Sleep by 3?

Woke at noon. Rumination. [[TTTOTW]].

A wild [[flowoptic]] appears...A wild [[Loup Vaillant]] appears...

Preacher cookies. Yum. Dialectics with my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]]. Cleaning. Talked with my sympaticon about cryptography, [[Atropos]], licensing, and more.

[[Family Time]] @ 5? Easy going. I'm enjoying going through the [[Yearly Cross-section]]s on the wikis that participate. I made rice, and I had some curries to go with mine. Finished off //Stranger Things// (I'm so glad it's over, :P). [[TTTOTW]].

Prepped the bottle for walking. I like the look of those.

//The Walk// with my sympaticon. Chilled and [[TTTOTW]].

[[TTTOTW]] + //Laboratory Greece//. Watermelon. Good god I've had to speak with a lot of evil people lately. It's draining. Helped my sympaticon troubleshoot a default behavior on her phone. Watermelon. LolVods. Tried to sleep at 2:30. Back up at 3. [[TTTOTW]]. Attempted again at 5. 

Woke at 10:30. Seems like enough. Meditation. [[Morning Routine]]. Assignments. Cleaning. [[TTTOTW]]. Failed to find children's books today. Hrm. Had I money and help, we could remedy that. Still think my time is better spent on harder problems at the moment. 

I am losing time with my offspring, as their classwork is now extending to 2pm. `/sadface`. I get less time with my grownass offspring than ever. Take every bit I can get.

My daughter decided she wanted to drive today. Woot! Took a while to find a parking lot, and we ended up using the one near our mechanic. Plenty of actual traffic near us. The Beast is a junker, lol. Doesn't even have the stuff she needs for the test. Picked it up quickly enough. Smooth, tight, in her lanes, and safe. I think we'll have fun practicing. She was in a good mood.

Offspring came down to grind. We had hotdogs and water.

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. //Inform the Men!// her day was busy and good. Kinda absurd how much school would cost if we had to pay for it (which, obviously, we could never). Cool to have brains with a half million dollars of certified education (no idea how to price her actual learning).

[[Family Gathering]] was delicious. We had brats and water. //House of Cards// seems to be holding attentions. =D. Dope. 

[[5c0ut]] got home, and his dedication to generating papertrails may be saving a butt here. More miscommunications from on-high, and this time they can show it. It's his boss and boss' boss' problem now. Phillip seems like a cool dude, and from little I know, I like his wife too.

A flash.

[[TTTOTW]].

Hard dialectics with my sympaticon.
