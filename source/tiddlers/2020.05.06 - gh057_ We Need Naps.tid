Going well. How are you?
May 6 9:45am
I cannot complain. Procrastinating more than I'd like, catchin' up on sleep.
May 6 9:46am
How's the family?
May 6 9:54am
Naps are my weakness. We started cleaning back at the school on Monday and im missing my nap time now...lol.
Familys good. My granddaughter spent the night with us last night. Good Times. How's your family doing? Kids back on task?
May 6 9:55am
I've been in a napping mood too. Tired.
May 6 9:56am
School feeling extra empty?
May 6 9:56am
Awesome that she got to spend the night with ya. Has she grown since the last time I got to see her?
May 6 9:57am
Kids are getting on task. [[k0sh3k]]'s the creative one; she's been finding good projects for them.
May 6 9:57am
Everyone's healthy, so I'm glad about that.
May 6 9:58am
I hope you get some rest. 
School does feel desolate. 
She grown she looks like a third grader LOL.

You think she'd be interested in sports?
May 6 10:04am
Also, you guys doing the floors at the school?
May 6 10:04am
We tried to get her to do sports and she doesn't seem real interested right now. 
We are cleaning until the 18th of then we start floors and supposed to be done in 2 weeks. There's no way I can do that though. I have 16 rooms and the offices LOL
May 6 10:06am
`/smh`, sorry man. That is ridiculous of them, yet again.
May 6 10:06am
What does she like to do?
May 6 10:07am
Maybe tech?
May 6 10:07am
Lol since they have been paying us...they gonna try to get it back by not extending our floor pay. Lol
She likes a lot of video games of course and YouTube really of course LOL I thought she would definitely like Tech
