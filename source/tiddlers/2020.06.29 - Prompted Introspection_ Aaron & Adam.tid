title: 2020.06.29 - Prompted Introspection: Aaron & Adam

!! Who is a friend you haven't seen for a long time but would like to see?

[[2019.05.24 - Prompted Introspection: Melisandre Revealed]] is a trip down memory lane, and it is well-argued. It's one of the warmer [[prompt]]s I've had the pleasure to reason about. Maybe I don't get to have the depth in my relationships that I yearn for, but I'm increasingly grateful to even yearn.

Aaron Farley and Adam Reams were friends of mine as a teenager. We were the oldest of three sets of older/younger brothers of the same ages in our youth group (neat coincidence). We used to go running early in the morning (my asthma slowing us down). We played some football. They allowed the autist to hang with them. I'd love to get them wicked high at this point. I don't think they would care for me, but it would be a walk down memory lane and a chance to think about the divergences in our lives.
