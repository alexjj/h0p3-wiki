title: 2020.07.03 - Prompted Introspection: Practically Perfect

!! What would be a practical example of a perfect day for you?

[[2019.06.11 - Prompted Introspection: Perfeck Day]] is a token answer I've given out of annoyance. It is true. My new question can still be answered that direction, but I don't feel like attaching the "on the assumption that most people will continue to be as evil as they are and that mass spontaneous cooperation on that day should not be taken into account" qualifier to it. You know what I mean, right dude?

Sure.

I suppose this is asking me to create an ideal [[Carpe Tempus Segmentum]] log. But, that is context-dependent. Perfect day for me during a drought is just really different from a rainy season. I'm never going to be able to answer this one to my liking. 

Fuck it. We'll do the "practical" utopian fantasy live!

* Wake up at noon.
** Perfectly refreshed. Best ~~night~~ morning of sleep since I was a child. 
** My dreams were cogent, I remember them, and they reveal the secrets of the universe for the day to me. 
** My brain feels good, I'm crisply lucid, and I'm brimming with happy thoughts. My eyes don't feel worn and crusty. My back and shoulders don't feel painful or stiff. 
** Oh, look, I feel at peace with the state of the world and what I've done about it enough to enjoy my time.
* [[Morning Routine]]
