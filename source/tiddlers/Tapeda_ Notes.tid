I agree with "You can't just be against something, you have to be for something else". And i really failed there.

Yet i thought it might still be a good idea to show the other side of the argument, then discuss alternatives in the comments. Where i also failed in giving examples or ideas to base discussion on.

So in conclusion; You're right

>>>> Thanks for writing this. I'm going through some shit and your comment helped.

>>> I agree almost completely, however i would further argue the semantics of fakeness/identity. You're right in people believing it to be artificial as you go through that process, i mean that's what most of this thread is talking about.

>>> However I think a healthy perspective is then what gives, well perspective. I find this falseness works for your inner monologue too, a bad habit can be as simple as being too hard on yourself, not giving yourself the same benefit of the doubt you may extend to others. Now if you "fake" it, and add positive thoughts into your line of thinking, what you're really doing is adding perspective I' would think. There are billions of people on this Earth, each with unique perspectives gathered from their every experience, now when i do get into some negative behavioral thought loop, i step back and think; "Ok yeah but why am i thinking of it like this", which experiences have i had that has made me have a thought/action-bias towards this line of thinking, and then look to one of the billions of others, who've been managing this simple task with a smile for a lifetime, while I get stuck in a negative pattern, and therefore can fail to even start.

>>> This is all a bit overly optimistic of course, but i do think there's an interesting open-ended question of: "To what extent does your experience inform your thought-bias, and the habit's you can and/or are willing to form".

>>> You can back it with some science of course, like the maybe quite flawed, but nonetheless interesting "lost in a mall experiment", in where people are convinced of a fictitious memory, merely added to their journal, and so the brain rationalized a probable scenario of being 'lost in a mall', this could from then on then also have some extent of an effect on your action bias, maybe you'll be slightly anxious the next time you're in a mall(lol), the underlying factual safety of the mall has not changed, however your perspective on it has.

>>> Just food for thought though.

>>it starts off as faking, but eventually it becomes more, like the thoughts becoming words becoming actions, ect. You dont start your life off with habits, same idea with personality, your personality will naturally change over time, but faking something to see it become a part of your personality feels artificial to a lot of people, even though in the end it is just one way our personality changes, but now we are arguing semantics, some people will see it as faking, others will just see it as change, but sometimes to really find yourself you need to set aside some time and introspect a little, this isnt throwing out the fake, or the unnatural, it is about how you define your self. Are you a person of emotions, logic, honor, desires, or pride (or a mix of all); knowing yourself is an important step you have to take in life. Is there someway you can take the chaotic definition of yourself and find order.

>>I dont know these are the questions i have been playing with in the past 2 or 3 years, but i think they have brought a good amount of peace to myself in my early adult years, but one thing has always remained constant and that is the thought that "I am me", it doesn't matter if i exist, it doesn't matter if im the only real person it doesn't matter if this world is some fever dream, it doesn't matter if parts of me are fake, the only thing i can be sure of and the only thing that i can build a foundation off of is that: I am me.

>is it really faking though?

>people think too narrowly on what is "themselves".

>if you're "faking" being happy while cooking breakfast, it becomes a habit to be happy during breakfast, if you're "faking" being confident, and it becomes habit you realize there was no reason to be afraid in the first place, and as some old Chinese coot put it:

>> Watch your thoughts they become words, watch your words they become actions, watch your actions they become habits, watch your habits they become character, watch your character, it's your destiny, your path

>Where in this case it's argued that nurture and experience can define, and redefine character/identity any amount of times throughout your life.

the thing with faking something in your personality is if you do it long enough it will become a part of you, but i think you might already have the threads of this idea in your grasp, but if you think on it a bit im sure you can find what you need.

>>>>>>>> Thanks for your kindness. And you're right, balance is probably best.

>>>>>>> No worries, shit happens. Like most parts of life, a bit of both is probably best.

>>>>>> You're absolutely right and I can't believe I didn't notice that to begin with. My apologies. I do believe it is better to interact with others with outgoingness and humor (and more personally, attentiveness, positivity and empathy), and I make every effort to do so. But that's just my opinion, and I'm very sorry I worded the opposite so judgementally.

>>>>>> I also see merit to the idea that constantly maintaining this positive persona can have negative effects on the self, and also perhaps come across as insincere. Maybe there is a healthy balance.

>>>>> And you yourself have projected botherment onto me, since I am not actually bothered in the slightest. My point is, that your wording implies heavily that it is worse to be quiet than it is to be outgoing. "Chipper outgoing and funny," versus "mopey and shitty." It comes across as judgemental.

>>>> I didn't imply any of what you just said. You've just projected onto me. All I said is that it's harder to constantly maintain a persona of positive energy than the often more genuine negative energy. I said Americans because I'm American and have no other frame of reference. Jesus Christ.

>>> That implies that it is inherently superior to be outgoing than it is to be the quiet type. Who made you god and gave you the right to decide what the correct form of social engagement is? And what does America have to do with anything? If anything Americans are known for being more outgoing than most modern nations. To a point where we consider them weird for it. I mean what kind of monster talks to strangers on the bus?

>> Choosing to be a positive, chipper, outgoing, and funny person is hard (especially if you weren't raised that way). It's easier to be mopey and shitty which is why many Americans are.

> Sure, made those strangers happy. But it’s fucking draining. Sometimes you just decide you don’t have time for that anymore.

I mean don't give up on empathy due to your perceived battles with it, you are what you do, no? I don't think identity is so shallow that being positive, chipper, outgoing, and funny to someone, while being a anxious nihilist in your lonely hours makes you an anxious nihilist.

The people who experienced you as your "fake" identity, still got their moods lifted, still smiled because you did, who's to say that's any less, even if you battle over later if it was even genuine, the moment hasn't dissipated.

Box within a box, ad infinitum, ad nauseum.

It's almost the way thought intrinsically works, when propagating "down" the graph and abstracting, the distribution becomes less and less nauseous, and a more precise prediction can be made, however in reverse, the more fundamental we try to predict from, the more nauseous, or rather the more confused/anxious the prediction is.

What Deus could predict, was that the probability of its own demise given the probability of her presence was 95% let's say, and so when propagating further, the choice to throw the gun was insignificant in the overall "fixed" outcome, if however, all characters had observed themselves, instead of all but one, the 5% may have been the likely again.

You can always take a step back, and think about/"watch" your thoughts from a further out vantage, and those are then no less your thoughts than the previous.

Maybe if the dichotomy you define is black, and grey, instead of black and white, your outcomes can only fall within the dark. but we always use our best model, never one we can know to be truly the deepest black, or whitest white.

Everyone within Devs followed Deus exclusively. as they knew the moment they didn't the predictions would falter.(the machine was kept in perfect isolation from any outside influence portrayed by the field holding the cube, and so once an entire understanding of the behavior of the isolated particles within the cube were understood one could extrapolate the rest of existence from the mouse as they are part of the same creation, or in the case of wolfram's theory, inter-linked in some hyper-graph, where time is meaningless as it converges due to causal invariance)

EDIT: And so using the Everett interpretation, that which considering ALL possible paths back to the most fundamental, leads to less nauseous descent, and perfect prediction, in contrast of following the finite road that lead to his current reality(How he accepts that living within Deus is no different than living without. He so badly wanted to change his current reality to the one his daughter was alive, instead of accepting it passed, "I'm not personally a big fan of the Everett interpretation; 'Nick Offerman', Ep01"). The specific death was always his death in the timeline in which both his daughter died, and everything we viewers observe also happens.

Alex Garland is a bit of an eccentric dude so of course in the last episode he pulls the bait and switch with which box we were in by zooming out inconspicuously from the Deus screen, or [string-board](https://i.imgur.com/T1sl0tq.png) for [Ariadna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariadne), if you like the Greeks.

I'm not saying i agree with any connotations to reality, and maybe Alex Garfland is just a slight neo-liberalist, but this was just food for thought after watching a good show.

So i entirely agree, but try this framing if you will,

the simulations are dreams, the same way a strong quantum computer may be optimal in running a simulation by considering a massive set of dimensions or nodes of data in a neural net, much the same we use our memories to construct visions of reality through our dreams using the extraordinary neural net situated in our brains.

what if when we go to sleep it's scarily analogous to the training of an artificial neural net?

we know that rats will run through the same neural patterns as of when they learned a maze in their sleep at 20x speed, the night of first seeing it, and have a measurably better sense of direction through it after.

So perhaps, this version in which she wears the infinity necklace, is only a version where she believes infinity to be real in a "true" sense, and in that reality she wakes from a dream of what could be, 'before'* the death of his daughter.

*before/time may be meaningless under Garfland's parameters this means even in the infinite-necklace reality she has free will and if she were to set in action anything leading to the death of his daughter it would kaskade similarly to how it unfolds from Ep01. Yet what makes her "different" is her one definition of being more afraid of not acting on herself, than trying and failing. once the structure of his daughters death is set in time in unfolds from there, in a structure that is constantly present within him, hidden in his darkest dreams.

* In one reality this makes it so she saves the world from the mad false prophet by use of a gun, we think we follow this from episode Ep01 but are fooled in the last episode.

* In the next, she uses her free will after learning of her shooting shown by the machine(image in a dream, given by who(what?), i wonder? Perhaps Deus Ex Machina^*) this makes the end parameters on where she truly changes her mind, throws the gun, yet was too little too late, and still indirectly leads to both their deaths so she saves the world from the mad false prophet. This we actually follow from Ep01.

* Now in the final reality/scene where she wakes up having dreamt of every box we've seen, and the meta-box of being in boxes which you might be able to say she's inclined to dream by wearing the necklace and having a thought/action bias towards the dream. She acts in defense of his madness before it starts as to caress it back to the depths of his subconscious, and stops before a kaskade can align.




\*Perhaps the power, and proper 'deus ex machina' in the show is that you are able to influence the world based on making calculations towards your subconscious idea of a manifest destiny, if you accept what Garfeld portrays, that she had one thing different about her, her tendency to act on her deepest fears instead of pushing them away(still going to devs in the final). She perhaps manifested that trait in all realities, and still played her *part*.

If you've watched 'Devs' the new FX show by Alex Garland (guy who did Ex Machina and annihilation) it handles it pretty well IMHO. If you were to want something to predict every state of every particle the machine required to do so would also need to be as large as the "entirety" of the universe to function perfectly, and when they finally make it "work", they end up merely throwing random initial states at it, and allow predictions from there (Everett interptetation), the problem naturally arises that then if you were to observe the prediction, its predictions would start to falter as your new found knowledge of events were not apart of its original input, this drives Nick Offerman slightly mad until he accepted his realities futile fate, but also accepts the invariance between the continued living version of himself within the "simulation". If you've ever played the game 'Soma' it tackles it similarly by use of a double ending, anyway Nick Offerman had slowly built himself a messiah-complex throughout the show which ultimately fails.

I think that has some interesting implications with how a belief in authoritarianism is mostly a belief in a one true messiah, one's who's word will always be gospel or truth. If one takes a 'fatalist' attitude towards something it usually means it's outside ones reach of influence, and you can only watch it unfold. I've anecdotally found(and I'm not American) that a lot of people have started to take a fatalist approach towards politics, where it's easier to pawn the responsibility off on authority.

Forgive my ignorance, but I've heard many say that the reason they only vote in the presidential elections, is that many of their wishes in policy are only at a federal level. However at least from the outside in, I see such a large diversity in culture between American states that I find it sometimes odd how broad the federal policies go, and how sometimes Texans, Kansanites, Californians all are governed by similar heavy-handed policies, I'm not sure the goal of politics should be homogenizing culture, even if it's the easiest when you've lost trust in your neighbors due to some YouTube conspiracy you watched on Bill Gates.

While watching the show I think it's interesting to think about what the fundamental difference is in the identity of the women protagonist cryptographer, relative to the rest. Cool show for some food for thought, don't take it as gospel however ;)

TL;DR: Watch Devs, it's not perfect but can serve as pretty good food for thought! Wrote this on my phone procrastinating sleeping it's rough sorry

Devs, a [hyper-graph](https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/introduction/) Perspective I guess.

- If we accept what was different in Lily from the rest was her tendency to act based not on belief but of her fear of the consequence if she didn't like Katie explains.

- If we accept what led Henderson to end up disillusioned and angry at the entire team of Devs to be a product of Forest's disregard for the kid.


They all followed the word of the messiah (Forest), taking every word as gospel, began to doubt their own rationality in favour of the word of what they perceived to be from the almighty "god"/deus. Yet lily at the very end having been told her "fatal" future of shooting Forest with the gun, refuses and calls him nothing more than another false messiah, and acts against Deus, now how could she do this if the almighty had predicted otherwise?

Well i'd argue god is not some all mighty machine factoring our destinies. Even Jesus told us to not take every word and act of his as gospel, or perfection, and that even he was a false messiah at the end, but to let the best of him live on throughout forever in the heart of man.

Forest had even deluded himself in believing his machine was anything more than a view/prediction of his current trajectory, cause if that were true he not never get his precious daughter home to this reality.

Forest's delusion led him to banish the blasphemer that was the kid that told him he wore no clothes. This banishment started a kaskade leading to Henderson to hatred of the word of Forest, and pushing of the button to let the horizontal-elevator fall.


The graph theory version of this goes something like that the act(node) of banishment sent a lower graph in play, which reconnected to the higher graph at a point which blocked any future where the survival of Lily and Forest was possible. So banishment was the *cause* of both Lily's, and Forest's guaranteed deaths at that point. If in someway Henderson had never grown angry towards the Devs operation, the reality where she threw the gun to the ground would have saved their lives, yet due to a past event of banishment it occurred anyway, causally invariant.


Lily's deus ex machina^[1](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeusExMachina) to save the day at what seemed to be a hopeless situation in the plot was her intuition that in actuality all messiah's are false in the end^[2](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/gmocfl/new_study_finds_authoritarian_personality_traits/fr6c9d2/), and so [god was within all men, not one man, nor a group of men](https://youtu.be/J7GY1Xg6X20?t=138).



**TL;DR:** God is in all men, all messiah's who claim to know a final truth are wrong, but a past event, that you may not even have knowledge of can come bite you in the arse anyway. [Eh?](https://www.insider.com/devs-alex-garland-stewart-finale-explained-2020-4)

P.S. This is messy, feel free to tell me where i'm deluded.

P.P.S. Interesting implication for Garland's Ex Machina movie would be that any machine that arbitrates change is one with god in its veins, no matter the perceived artificiality to humans.

P.P.P.S. What if Nietzsche's implications were only that we've stopped thinking for ourselves, and put trust in some [authority](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/gmocfl/new_study_finds_authoritarian_personality_traits/)?

> The Devs take on knowing your future can't be what's happening in Tenet. Devs slogs along and assumes "manifest destiny" i.e. the future cannot change, the whole show and then gut punches the audience that _yeah, you can change things if you will it hard enough.

> In Primer, their device isn't instantaneous, yet Tenet's device seems to be instant.

> Where in Primer travelling backwards through time requires submersion in the box (B-end to A-end) for each instant you want to reverse time. Tenet performs an instant state-change of whatever is being submerged. Tenet also likely performs another state change in order to go forward in time. So, it's 2 boxes in Tenet.

If i could add, that perhaps what quantum mechanics tells us is that as part of the system, our observation of the system, changes the parameters of that very same systems output, as if we were both the action and the observation in some [OODA-loop?](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/OODA.Boyd.svg/1200px-OODA.Boyd.svg.png), and to truly be in control of such a system one would have to be its entirety.

*Eric Weinstein's geometric unity*, **TL;DR;^maybe** using the most fundamental concept described in math/by math(up to denotation, and connotation), [spinners](https://youtu.be/YjsPb3kBGnk?t=4198) generate his predictive model of reality, as a study of super-structure symmetry in a [hypergraph](https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-introduction/potential-relation-to-physics/multiway-systems-in-the-space-of-all-possible-rules/) using number notation, or vica versa, math is described by the image of the infinite shown within the hyper-graph theory.


**TL:DR;TL:DR:**^electric-boogaloo Nothing will be one, when no-thing^no-separation is every-thing. The system that outputs 1 from the input of 0, can only be described by all infinitesimal-bits in between the symbols, by use of decimals, but therefore within an isolated system entropy must increase, as the calculus used to describe the system approaches 1 *infinitely*, but never reaches, which is not something for all of us to grasp, but for our concept of the "everything" to understand. Therefore the universe chaotically follows a kind of Penrosian cyclic information passing behavior. where the chaos leads to the same structure under different rules, given infinite time. Where the chaos input is the low-variance information passing from one universe to the next. **So i am fundamentally looking to be proved wrong;** As it's the only true way forward.^[1](https://www.azquotes.com/picture-quotes/quote-there-can-be-no-ultimate-statements-science-there-can-be-no-statements-in-science-which-karl-popper-98-92-15.jpg)^[2](https://i2.wp.com/jameslyonsweiler.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/karl-popper.png?resize=700%2C625&ssl=1)^[3](https://i.redd.it/vx5d9f1rsbez.jpg)^and-into-the-rabbit-hole-we-go

An interwoven play of Love and Life.

We come in screaming to go back to rest in the good night, however but, we find a smile the gesture, a longing for here, more of love, light, yet of blight, and right. 

left is law, right is twice, shall we read from our right to our lefts, or leave right to our backs?


Some conspicuous day left in my life where my spirit joins the night for a guiding of the light, is somewhere right, I choose to hold my one, and lonely illusion, that such heresy as death remains, irregardless of my spite, yet woven by wolves to an ever fight.

I find myself every other night with sight of a man with powers as strong as night, only despite this titrating light, the worried trite of night he bears leaves me scarred and in flight. 

However one might find forking between rules of law, and right, throughout the night, one must care, as we [fear](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/928-our-deepest-fear-is-not-that-we-are-inadequate-our), not for our knight, but for our mad king's trance towards idealistic right.

The beginning is the night, the end of the light, the end is the beginning, draw yourself at night, and find the path that meets you right, middle of the left, but between the nights our [Wolven](https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/spomenik-memorials-yugoslavia-balkans) life.

[Post rationalism](https://meaningness.com/metablog/stem-fluidity-bridge#postrationalism), on the grounds of computational irreducibility of the past. We're deluded in ideals of the transcendent, we only have 10 fingers, and 6 senses, for now after all.

Systems of axioms are complete only when entirely dependent on each-other. Yet entirely independent from out-coming connections.

>when viewed in computational terms most of the great historical triumphs of theoretical science turn out to be remarkably similar in their basic character.  For at some level almost all of them are based on finding ways to reduce the amount of computational work that has to be done in order to predict how some particular system will behave.

I'd say start with the fun and end with the effort, let the fun inform the structure, or form not the feature by the form, but the fun on the feature. Painted from another plane i move, and dance here, so one day i may fly above this life.



Form, Function, Feature-thereof is pretty abstract but the fuck are you going to predict with that?..
perhaps go with the babbling babylons so sure of themselves, or the pharaonic Egyptians so free of themselves, go with the sphere or polyhedral, yet really maybe just some fun quadratic trills that shall form -[\[us\]](https://twitter.com/BWJones/status/1295431824567459846)- by *Jetzt*
