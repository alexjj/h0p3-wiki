title: 2021.05.17 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Fucking Knotweed

[[TTTOTW]], Fireman Time!, LolVoD + snack. By 3, I couldn't keep my eyes open any longer. 

Woke at noon, great sleep. Meditation for a long time. I heard my wife come down, but she doesn't want to disturb me (even though I'm begging her to disturb me). Laundry, that's my guess. =). That's kind of her. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

Laundry. Let's see how much hair I can collect from the lint trap. 

Watermelon and some cardslingin'. -0, 1, 0 gobbos vs MUC (my jokes about the transformation of that deck are landing :P), and I scooped lazily on the first (broke ass shit is broke), dropped dudes and tuktuk-jikied hard in the second, and the last was similar, but he sat at 1 forever, while I ramped vial to Siege him out.

//The Walk// was dope. I was worried it was gonna suck because dad has to say the truth. But, truth hit, and we moved on. My daughter led the conversation. We talked about stories. Always. That's her. I got poked, punched, and elbowed a lot: that's how you know it was a good one. Rain and very distant thunder started on our last leg, a light shower. It smelled good, and we had fun. A boomer with a mid-life crisis haircut clearly smoking cannabis asked us if we wanted a ride home. Everyone agreed it was great walk. I'll take that thank you. =).  

//Skintime//. 4 more days. The last push on this thing. One more hurdle. Unfortunately, no more remote in a few months. =(. We went out in the rain to see there was another japanese knotweed in the front. Someone had clearly chopped them down, and they've grown back quite strong (as they do).

Son helped me make dinner. Gracias, sir.

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! Installed 

[[Family Gathering]] was different. We decided to watch //The Fifth Element// (some technical trouble first, god damn rsyncs taking forever). I've shown my offspring a wide variety, but I know they remember little (understandably). This isn't the first time, but it seemed to fit. We drank it in together. Tendies (with wing sauce), Rally's fries (they sell them at the store, it's amazing), pickled veggies, and honeydew melon. I've got 5 chairs downstairs now. 

Chilled [[5c0ut]] in [[The Den]]. Laundry. Plans on making candy.
