* [[0.999R and 1, the problems of infinity and 3.]]
** `0.0R1` is a fascinating concept.
*** I adore how this thing eats you alive. It annoyed the shit out of me at your age too.
** I tell you a place that I think is really special for you to check out: https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Main_Page. 
*** My god is this place cool AF. I aint saying it's perfect, and I'm not saying it's ideal to only study already completed proofs all day (ya gotta make ur own, like you were thinkin' in ur tiddler). Dude, you should consider going through some of these proofs for math each day. 
**** Put them in your wiki. Take them, talk about them, get the LaTeX/KaTeX markup set. Make a tiddler for each proof. Build this thing in your wiki, eh?
**** Watch how others make proofs (I'm awful at it). While you have not made as much progress in mathematics as your sister, your quant feels stronger to me (and your standard testing scores were higher than hers [and, she is not exactly a slouch for her age, even if she is lazy as sin]).
*[[Notage Ti.18]]
** I'm convinced that your naming convention is a failure here. It can and should be more specific. Still, we all need a place to just dump things. That's why I have [[/b/]]. 
*** If you can find a place though, you generally should.
*[[2020.05.17 – Wiki Review: Failure]]
** Well, maybe for now you need that extra accountability. In a couple years, I'm gonna bet you will be far more disciplined and capable. I mean, have you seen the difference between 2018 and 2020 in this wiki? That's all you.
*** You did many of your other chores though. It's not like everything imploded when no one holding you accountable. Seems like at least a partial victory to me.
*** I know that it sucks right now. Let's keep working at it. You can do this, dude. I know it.
** Also, I'm not sure I would say the break was unhealthy. That seems backwards to me. I think it was super healthy for you have a break. You need some all-nighter experiences too. 
*** Most people would argue that how hard you have to work is unhealthy. Most of the dads I know send their offspring off to play, especially during the summer (mostly to get the kids out of their hair). I hope we can find the right balance here. 
**** "Balanced" is, like, my middle name, right? XD.
*[[2020.05.17 – TDL: Post-vacation repair]]
** I appreciate that you take yourself to having to "catch" yourself on the other end of vacation, to jump-start, fill in the gaps, etc.
*[[2020.05.17 – Prompted Introspection: Crying]]
** Aim for simplicity. You've got too much mud in here. 
** Can you cry without emotion? How?
** It's important to cry. I'm glad you do.
** I think you are increasingly constructive with your negative emotions. 
*[[2020.05.17 – Carpe Diem: Post-vacation repair]]
** Yeah, it is mailed-in. I've been there, homie.
*[[2020.05.17 – Antipleonasm Analysis: Lincoln has a point.]]
** I love your arguments. You handle the major concerns and threw a fastball. Ol' Lincoln would be shocked by your claim. 
** Break this up into paragraphs. Use moar periods.
** Your opening is difficult to parse. Perhaps the entire argument needs to be revised to sound more natural (I don't know). It needs clarity.
*** Most people aren't going to have a clue what you are getting at even if you said it cleanly though. Do you know that? The goal, however, is to write so as to include a much broader audience than just us. 
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** It's been a while since I've heard you utter "Watevs."
** You continue to evolve, son. I appreciate your hard work. I know it isn't usually fun.
