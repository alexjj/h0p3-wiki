title: 2020.11.03 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Voegelin

* Watching junk.
* Fireman Time!
* //The Social Dilemma//
* Read+Write+//Fool Us//
** Like everyone else in the world, I just want to be deceived [[irwartfrr]].
* Chips and a beer
* Sleep by 6
* Woke at 1:30
* [[Morning Routine]]
* The LLounge
* Read+Write
* //The Walk//
** I needed a walk, badly. Asked 3 people, and one said yes. =).
** Saw Max the Librarian.
*** Catching up on library-talk. 
*** He said my work (Max, are you still reading this madman's words?) reminded him of Eric Voegelin, considered me a student of his, said his professor made him read Voegelin.
**** I said I didn't think so, but I needed to look again. I should have said there's influence. That can't be denied.
**** I agree there's plenty of crossover (not the least of which is that I come from LSU, and you can still feel the effects in their polisci department), also with [[Strauss]]. I admire conservatism in many respects. I appreciate his conceptions of trust, alienation, and transcendence, though we may have a radical conflict in "Don't immanentize the eschaton!" It depends. I recognize the necessity of [[Faith]], especially for [[Justice]]. I have plenty in common with Gnostic Speculation and inventing terms. I may have a more mechanical perspective and the benefit of hearing many voices that came after.
***** I should continue thinking about it.
*** I wish we spoke longer. 
** It was a pleasant long one.
** Both parents think their daughter could be an incredible longconwoman, if she ever chose to do that. She can read some people like a book. She'd be dangerous, no doubt. It's a good thing she has holds herself accountable so thoroughly and doesn't practice the dark arts. [[Killcoin]]'s assessment that I'm delusionally raising Marxist-spy-assassins is pretty close to the mark. I like how he can name it where few can, but he knows how serious I am, unlike most.
* Write
* Found out we had spend $1k on the second appraisal. This was not in the paperwork, nor did our realtors even "realize" it until later. Maybe they are clowns or we are.
* Quick fix of dinner with offspring
* 3 Tablespoons of ABV. 
** Never tried it. Fuck the extraction. The taste isn't even there (though it's very dry, and I suggest water). 
** Could be nothing I feel, or it could knock me on my ass. I'm excited. =)
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Muffalettas, veggies, pineapple, water
** Discussed election
** Offspring played [[MTG]]
*** I like listening to them play. They play it like kids do. Also, they aren't spike about it, but they explore it as a social lubricant and cardboard rhetoric. At the very least, they speak of the cards, and when they are lucky, more stories emerge. So much better than I was, boy. Go you.
**** Seems like the easiest way to have friends over for them. I like teaching kids magic too. Even adults have something to learn from such a game.
* //Skintime// + Garbage shows
* Nap in lap...
* Woke at 11:55
** Smooth, lowkey highness. 

I am going to miss that walking path. In addition to its primary purposes, there's several scholars we've run into now. That's lucky. I think this is one of the things I miss about academia the most; it's a shame. I am still called by [[The Moral Law]] to [[aim]] to speak with everyone. I don't belong in the ivory tower, but it is interesting up there. I belong in the digital dirt, grass, roots, tentpegs, naked penises.
