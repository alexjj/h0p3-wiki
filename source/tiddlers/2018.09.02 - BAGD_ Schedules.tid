title: 2018.09.02 - BAGD: Schedules

We're at it again, Pinky. The month long unschooling test gave us our results.<<ref "2021.09.02-1">> We will try again sometime. I cannot hand your autonomy over to you without evidence that you've already taken it up,<<ref "2021.09.02-2">> that you are being Reasonable of your own Reason. This process is an iterative growth of your autonomy.<<ref "2021.09.02-3">> We are engaged in a kind of scientific method.

You are taking notes right now, right?

There's a richness to our tutorial dialectic Socratic method. Let's use it!<<ref "2021.09.02-4">>

I'm looking for you to turn up your effort to 80% and leave it there. Have room to turn it up to 11 when you really need it, but you need to build spaces where you chill.

my empirical measurement of how you try has to be based on something tangible. I need results; actions speak louder than words, although words are absolutely necessary (even if they are insufficient).

I need a pause button for my sound for you.<<ref "2021.09.02-5">>

<<footnotes "2021.09.02-1" "It's failed every time, and I'm glad we did it. It's been part of the ticktock process for us. I don't know how to demonstrate to a student that they ultimately have to be in charge of their own learning (it's not like anyone ever did that for me), but these risks/attempts were worthy. It gave us plenty of talking points and examples that we still use today, and it allowed us to flesh out the goals of school as well as the nature of their growing autonomy with spaced repetition.">>

<<footnotes "2021.09.02-2" "Sadly, the evidence often turned out to be simply a refusal to do any work despite any carrots and sticks available. I can only [[hope]] they won't have to pay absurd prices for it.">>

<<footnotes "2021.09.02-3" "This has turned out to be a more vital topic each passing year. I'm simply never a good enough father. I [[hope]] they'll think charitably about this evidence.">>

<<footnotes "2021.09.02-4" "Can't stop, won't stop. I'm no longer their official teacher for their official schoolwork, but we still do this every day. I wouldn't trade it for almost anything. It's made them both formidable in some hard places.">>

<<footnotes "2021.09.02-5" "Eventually, working in their own rooms and developing enough trust for them to wear headphones (which is still quite imperfect) have been more useful. This practice has great for watching or listening to stories together though. We gotta sit and talk sometimes.">>
