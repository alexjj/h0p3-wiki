title: 2021.12.08 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Sympaticon

Mandarins. Chilled with [[ASK]] + chatted with [[ASmith]] + [[TTTOTW]]. [[ASK]] made me some lemon ginger tea and pomegranate. //Death at a Funeral// + //Raw Skintime//. Sleep by 4?

Woke at 11. Vivid dreams keep coming. Rumination, Meditation, Fireman Time! Pushed Brix. Hugs'n'bugs. [[ASK]]'s back isn't feeling great, but I think she's in a good mood (better than yesterday, I think). Offspring grinding with me in [[The Den]]. Rabbithole on permaculture, and my daughter's Vox book. We tested the quasi-NUC power adapter in several places, and it trips a breaker on most. Looking for a replacement, and, ofc, we aren't the only people having trouble with it. [[TTTOTW]]. [[ASK]] joined us as well, and she adds perspective, flavor, and wisdom.

[[TTTOTW]] + Speaking with [[Anon]]s. My daughter was commentating the entire time as she shouldersurfed while she was supposed to be researching for an RPi setup that would suit her needs. With lost wireless access, except on my own machine for the grind, she lacks that [[RGM]]. Time to force a headless "remote" route. Walked through this with both of them. We had a conversation about markets, supply chains, and chip manufacturers, ofc. She's wrestling with [[Outopos]] concepts. We considered collaborative editing among friends (and trusted strangers); raTox as transport for subl and nvim CRDT plugins. 

[[TTTOTW]].

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. Told me all abouts her day. One of those: she did good work, but she doesn't feel like she accomplished much or made progress. A backslidin', `/nod`. Quite a political creature taking off his mask at the end of his run. Let's play dumb. S makes an excellent point about how much C worships her for the eval. G continues to open up, imho; game recognize game, yo (jk, I'm shocked by his tech skills). M is delusional, and hopefully patience will take it down. Meetings were kinda a wash. Prep for presentation on that presentation.maymay. 

[[Family Gathering]] was dope. [[ASK]] made a deconstructed chicken pot pie soup with mash potatoes at the center (stew was gravy, yo). Holy shit. Yus. I had two. Also, she baked salted strips of pie crust to dip. Yus. It was outstanding. Watched the CIPA episode of //House//. Laundry. //Skintime// with mi amor.

Brief exchange with, [[search_social]]. `/wave`. Still lookin' for moar. Love to see your systematic write-up, if you ever have the chance. [[TTTOTW]]. Hugs'n'bugs. Put mi amor to bed. Finally toast. Still needs to buy that bulk D, and at least she's taking one set to her office. I need to arrange if for her. Waiting on [[5c0ut]] here, I think. 

//The Walk// with [[ASK]]. Snowing hard. Some false starts, including, primarily, that we had to head back for me change shoes so I had any grip. I think I'm [[lucky]] I didn't fall today. Vapelyfe. It was excellent. She's my sympaticon.
