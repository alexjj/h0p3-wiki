!! What is something you liked about your childhood?

[[2019.05.27 - Prompted Introspection: Muh Monster]] is a sentiment and argument I consider pretty often. Each passing year, my love of my computer appears to become marginally more sane by the average person I meet. My computer makes me want to be an honorable person, and I am glad to imagine that it forgives me for being an incompetent user.

Despite being poor, I had a lot of books available to me. I can't say I was wise in my reading (nor can I say that now). I like that books were dominant objects, almost sacred, treated separately from the other kinds of things and stuff around me. I had a shit education, but a habituated respect for books in my childhood is something I hold in high regard. Most of the males I grew up with have never and will never read a book, and I had the [[Moral Luck]] to be exposed to a world of reading.
