title: 2021.09.20 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Talking To Folks

<<<
Finished speaking with [[ASK]]. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! Cleaning. Corn quesadillas + Footbath + LEC Playoffs + [[TTTOTW]].

Added KaTeX plugin for TW. I need markups and shit, I guess.

[[ASK]] has asked, and the answer is yes. They are safe enough to their standards, so we aren't in a rush. There's lots to get in order. I may be going on a significant road trip. 

I don't remember how sleep operated. I think I got some. Fek. Sorry.

[[Family Time]] was longer than I thought it would be and thankfully less concerned with my own writing. It was nice, except, [[m16]] froze up! Seriously. 100%. OOM maybe, but 100% CPU. Primary suspects are either FF or Etherpad. Vapelyfe. I pontificated and rambled about the usual problematics, and everyone quite patiently listened. I never stop talking. Also, my daughter said to me, "I have no idea what you just said. There were like 12 layers of sarcasm there." We are doomed. I regularly can't recognize even one of hers. Imho, some of the [[art]] to fitting sarcasm is a willingness to walk down the disjunction in proof by cases.

We watched //Star Trek III: The Search for Spock// while eating pizza (my offspring are now officially addicted to anchovies with me). I never recognized so thoroughly the moral problem in it (I guess I just passed it off or something? How did I miss this? I'm an idiot, of course.). I really wanted to watch the next one, but it was late. 

That girl denied me, and her argument was terrible (almost PMSing bad). I much prefer the: I'm exhausted. Yes, you are. Mini-//Skintime//. Go have alone spoon-recharged time, get some sleep, loser. <3. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Chat with [[ASK]]. I [[love]] them. Kinda insane how fast we connected all over the fucking place (I'm extremely excited to see how [[k0sh3k]] interacts with them). One of the most interesting parts to me is how crazy hard it is to model them. I think they are like some brokenly brilliant cyberwitch who has reverse engineered everything through agonizing chaos and abuse. They are a high-bandwidth caliber [[wrestler]] I very rarely encounter. Unstable? That's the wrong way to look at it. It is as though they constructed the ground beneath their feet from nothing, from thin air, from magical powers or something. Insofar as it is up to them, they DM their own absurd life [[beautifully]]. Words don't do them [[justice]], and they live in words. I'll never be able to do them justice, lol. I'm encouraged to try anyhow. You got it.

Woke at 6? I kept waking up, but I know I dreamed hard. It was good. She's up, and I caught a few minutes before she left. She decided she's feeling fine and wants to go today. Okay.<<ref "o">> She knows the answer I'm looking for is: I will seriously think about it, and I am open to the claim. It's often the get-out-of-jail free card with me. I'll shut up. I brought out leftovers and cut up the melon. She says I never stop smelling like garlic (woman, I'm pretty sure I can't live without garlic). Pushed bricks. Hugs'n'bugs. Prep for dinner.

[[TTTOTW]]. Chat with [[ASK]]; someone who has a more messed up sleep schedule than I do: it's impressive. We can't use sleep as stable landmarks for rhythmically slicing time. Sounds like a Pod is the way to go here. Talking about how to preserve the box and cello. I have a chance to be a pillar for this person, to calm the chaos. Footbath + Vapelyfe + [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

Oh, exikyut, `/wave`. It's my pleasure.

//The Walk// with my offspring. My daughter seemed interested in exikyut. She still hasn't worked on the weeds (I'm not picky, but the concrete will erode; and, of course, the larger fight). Son watched plenty of The Youtubes, but he got some handwriting and math done. Vapelyfe. A large conversation about estimation and empiricism. He had difficulty remembering much about his day, including the animations he was watching. My son broke down for a bit (quite understandably), and we halted a few times to reflect. We sat down on the hill for a bit too. Lots of hugs and tears. Continue to think about what life is like for the other 13yo manboys on the planet. My daughter had a lot to say about pathos, logos, and ethos; she is ever suspicious and opinionated. She offered a poor argument to her grand donors, so I can see why they responded as they did. She needs to practice.

[[JRE]] called toward the end of the walk. Painful being a father sometimes. We have very few people we can talk about it with in many respects. It is my opinion that most people have no place talking about masculinity at some levels; it is a lived experience that teaches us qua qualia in non-trivial cases. A difficult and sustained argument with [[Rb]], and my brother was extremely rational, humble doubt, and reserved in extending the argument (except for a joke that was in beyond poor taste<<ref "l">> [even I wouldn't have uttered that one, though probably only because I'm not clever enough], despite it proving his point with brutal logic). [[Gradual]]ized [[T42T]] is such an expensive thing to live and teach. Had an argument against anti-vaxx sentiments 3 vs 1 at work, but at the end one complimented him on standing his ground (or the IDGAF attitude more than anything). A series of unholy jokes were unleashed. Sometimes my brother [[JRE]] is the only one could can maintain the darkest humors I know with me. His nurse practicioner is a 10, and she was obviously unhappy at the thought of giving him a prostate exam; he's a lucky man. We have very strong opinions about our sex toys, and, apparently, he can no longer show anyone his VR setup because it is that infested with porn that he's ashamed to show anyone except his brothers, lmao. [[Rb]]'s school is going alright, but she curiously is kinda lacking the ability to ask questions about her work (which is odd, as she is quite intelligent). He needs to set up new laptop (or, she could, but competitive advantages and so forth, she's busy enough as it is). He's thinking about writing [[letters]] to his offspring, since I was telling him that I've begun mine (guess I should push them out of buffer now). Also, my brother has offered to host my offspring whenever they feel like it, with no babysitting, just to be there. This seems excellent (and I think a Greyhound trip would do them a world of good). 

They came down to work on their machines. My daughter is upset, but she has two to fix. It's sometimes no fun being in an argument that lasts for years with me; I don't pick those fights accidentally. Son gave me the proof and some explanation. Cool. Recommendations on archiving pornography and other smut, like regular [[art]], thinking about syncs. 

She's home. You got boxes to work on upstairs. I love you: get out. //Raw Skintime//. Not much to say about class, interestingly (that's odd, so something's off). We're in "I just need vent, don't try to solve the problem" territory with M (partially A, qua M). Apparently, I'm not allowed to write a section of mashnotes to SZ on this ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±.<<ref "d">> PT Becky requires an invite (`/fingers-crossed`). You laughed at my joke, so you must be way into it.<<ref "sz">> I've officially requested Harley Quinn for Halloween. Welp, I'm on the edge now. //Inform the Men!// Meditation. Cleaning. I'm letting her off the hook for showering, all on her own. May it be her sanctuary.

[[TTTOTW]].

[[5c0ut]] and I rubbed our fuzzy nipples together, and we all got food. [[Family Gathering]], The Board Voting episode of //House//. My daughter keeps flipping me the bird the entire time, especially when we pick out rhetoric. I think she kinda likes it. =).

Helped [[5c0ut]] with automating his torrenting again. Should be noice and clean. 

//Skintime// + //Project Runway// until I heard her snore. Bedtime, girl. Stat. (As much as I despise the thought of not holding her, sleep is what she needs).

[[TTTOTW]].

Sleep by I don't know? 10?

<<footnotes "o" "I'm glad you thought about it. Thank you (for the Xth time).">>

<<footnotes "l" "I roar-squealed laughing twice in that conversation.">>

<<footnotes "d" "She's `/point` always wet. Gynecologists agree to three things: she has child bearing hips, she is well-lubricated, and since she is born to breed, it's my job (and hopefully others') to put a load in the dishwasher (proverbially, as, in fact, she has never really cared for doing dishes). Thank the maker for that babymaker. In any case, SZ, I enjoy it dry too. `/wink`. Have you ever been with someone will who both rail and cuddle you senseless? We can talk OT if you want. Nothing gets me hornier than whispering sweet nothings about the progressive revelation `/eyebows` of OT sluts (no Jael roleplay).">>

<<footnotes "sz" "And, SZ, if you're into the joke, it's a not joke. =). It's never joke. I'm always dead serious about sex.">>
