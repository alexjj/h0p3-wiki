//...It's just empty. I feel that empty too.//

[[h0p3]]: //We all make mistakes. You look at me everyday, and you know that to be the case.//

[[j3d1h]]: //Thank you for interpreting it as a mistake. I know you generally do not.//

[[h0p3]]: //Mistakes are things for which we can be responsible, and there are often still consequences. I'm trying to find the fitting consequence here.//

[[j3d1h]]: //people tend to be ''less'' responsible for mistakes. the word "mistake" (usually?) implies you didn't know something about the situation.//

[[h0p3]]: //I'll agree that responsibility for mistakes comes in degrees. To what extent are you responsible for the work you've not done lately? What are you going to do about it?//

[[j3d1h]]: //I think I'm less responsible than I seem, and, supposedly, I'm going to try to fix it.//

[[h0p3]]: //You do inspire confidence.//

[[j3d1h]]: //I exude confidence.//

[[h0p3]]: //What do you want me to do? Put yourself in my shoes.//

[[j3d1h]]: //Change what you do to "a lot less" or "nothing."//

[[h0p3]]: //That hands you full responsibility. I don't think you are wise enough for it, but I'll admit you are, in some sense, mature enough for it here. I suppose we could disambiguate your claim, "I think I'm less responsible than I seem" (which has at least two distinct interpretations).//

[[j3d1h]]: //I don't see two different interpretations.//

[[h0p3]]: //You want me to let go of your hand, and if you don't wipe your ass or cross the street safely, then you'll accept the consequences of the skid marks? Are you going to bear the responsibility of your life here?//

[[j3d1h]]: //Take the pressure down for your offspring.//

[[h0p3]]: //I feel like I've already done that lately. Look at the profound freedom I've handed you past noon for weeks here. Even your mother hands you a couple days' worth of work spread across a week. Where can I further alleviate pressure that makes sense to both of us?//

[[j3d1h]]: //I don't know if it will make sense, but I have a theory.//

[[h0p3]]: //Could it be bunnies?//

[[j3d1h]]: //`*long, exaggerated sigh*`//

[[h0p3]]: //So, do you mean: simply lower my expectations in general?//

[[j3d1h]]: //No.//

[[h0p3]]: //Okay. I'm still not sure what I need to do. We've been somewhere similar to here what feels like a thousand times. Nothing, right? Fuck. You got it, kid.//

[[j3d1h]]: //I don't need you to do absolutely nothing. It also doesn't need to be all or nothing.//

[[h0p3]]: //I feel like I've specified what I think you should do fairly well. I still don't know how to specify what I need to do for you. If you choose to do nothing here, it will haunt you for the rest of your life. Maybe that's the risk we need to take though. I recall that your mother and I were both lazy AF slackers at your age.//

[[j3d1h]]: //I'm not lazy. I'm just entirely unmotivated.//

[[h0p3]]: //I'm not sure that distinction buys you what you think it does.//

[[j3d1h]]: //Laziness is a lifestyle; a lack of motivation is a lack of resources. "Just do it" does not work for me.//

[[h0p3]]: //Obviously, I think your argument is conveniently awful. I'm gonna let your hand go though. Your mother may still take your devices away, and we'll still be working toward machines where you have little use for them beyond schoolwork. I [[hope]] you find what you're looking for.//

[[j3d1h]]: //Thank you.//
