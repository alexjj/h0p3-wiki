title: 2020.11.07 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Fun & Relaxed

* Read+Write+Walk+Talk
** Delivering the goods to a self-hoster. `/salute`. I'm dead serious, homie.
* [[Seeking Sphygmus]] deepreading
* Read+Write+Walk+Talk
* Attempted sleep by 5:30?...didn't seal it until 6:30 from episode count. 
** Conversations flying through my head. Seeing my place in the world is dizzying enough.
* Woke with alarm at 1.
* Read+Write
* Talked with [[k0sh3k]] about her conversation with Rachel.
** She's perhaps climbed out of and recovered from her divorce pit enough to date. She wants someone who thinks (hell yeah!). She agreed to my assessment over my optimistic wife's, of course (I tend to be more accurate, as usual :P). 
** Among Trump-voters, this woman is a [[gem]] (similar to uncle [[Charlie]]; I do not hold him so responsible for his bamboozlement). She has spent her life helping children, particularly those who need it most. I am lucky to know this woman. She is like a beacon to me (and a beacon qua my wife as beacon). 
** They both tiptoe around politics so wisely. I think it's a dance that only empaths with decades of trust could do.
** They should talk more.   
* Walked With My Light In The Forest
* Howard and Ellen gave the USB drive back, said it was corrupt. Okay. 
** Welp, I take it the girl has wordlessly spoken in this way. That is not an accident. Lol. God damnit. 10-4, kid. I'm taking your hint. I will stop trying. You aren't on your own, but only you can solve this one.
* Read+ABV
* Inform the Men!
* Meditation
* Pizza, noodles+eggs, ginger beer
** My farts have been the deadliest.
* Talked with my daughter some. 
** Her day hasn't been great despite radical freedom. Not a terrible one though. Anhedonia, at the least. 
* //Skintime// + //Star Trek//
** Cat found a good groove with us too.
* Fell asleep holding her at 9?

Interactions with my offspring were minimal, especially for a Saturday. Most of the chores appear to have been done. My son is partially ducking me because he knows he hasn't solved the problem over the week that we were crystal clear about. Considering just killing the account off for him instead. If he really wants a number, he'll get one. I've talked about this several times too, and could be managed purely off an internet connection if he wanted to be resourceful.

Also, I need to continue to drag them out to walk with me. I can avoid the topics that must be avoided to a non-trivial degree. I know the pull of wanting to just live in one's room, no doubt. I'm wondering if they were able to connect with folks and perhaps make new friends like that had planned yesterday. We'll keep trying there.
