*** Leet investor's assessment is consistent with Marx's theory that surplus-value is produced by labor not capital. We are shocked :P that someone who makes money from knowledge of the market would essentially agree with Marx's descriptions of everything except prescription (which Marx can't justify either), Ian. Gracias.

*** Hey, loser, this is a place you should consider. Only a true retard or NPC would engage this. Aside, we've talked about it before (you don't remember), but Julia needs to be added to the list of languages you try out, please.

*** I'm not convinced this works under advanced oppression. I agree that it is likely wiser to sneakernet just the plain files and database for metadata (so if they want to build something with it, they can) inside nested TC containers + at least one steganographic tech. Incidentally, this is one of the reasons I recommend Tiddlywiki too. There are limits to how safe we can make it to smuggle information, especially if the user is not going to be literate.

*** I'm not sure which of you ~~shits~~ based autists wrote this, but <3. It hurts. I must admit: I have no idea how it's possible that I get to have sex at all.

*** The entire set of accounts has a special vibe. I have extremely mixed feelings about it.
*** "Everything has two meanings." There's enormous clarity in this (obviously privileged) kid. This one is going places.
*** I have exceptionally strong Gen X characteristics for someone my age, perhaps an indicator of the conservatism in my genetics and conditioning.
*** This is also the first time I've ever been pissed off that autoplay doesn't go forward on this atrocious platform.
