<<<
Tom yum noodles, water, pudding. [[TTTOTW]]. LoL Worlds.

//The Walk// with my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]]. Sleep by 6?

Woke at 2? Hugs'n'bugs. [[TTTOTW]].

Read //Alphabet of Thorns// to my sympaticon.

A wild [[thijshelder]] appears...

//Skintime// with mi amor. //Inform the Men!// Shower of the gods!

[[TTTOTW]].

Made noodles for myself and offspring (don't think they cared for it). 

[[Family Time]] was quick! Not much written, not much read. `/shrug`. Opt-in accountability. All growed up. //The Sandman//. 

Mi amor chilled with me. She's feeling better about the exam, and she should. Thought about a translation of someone's beatitudes, wondering what Paul would have thought about them. She's going to be taking her migraine meds and trying to get some real sleep. Another device to attempt to ease her back, and we're going to keep trying to find any even partial solutions while we have healthcare. 

Baked potatoes, meat morsels, water. Watched LoL Worlds with my sympaticon.

Sleep by 9. Tried staying up as late as I could. 
<<<

Woke at 2. Meditation, but gumpination that can be set aside. `/thumbs-up`. [[5c0ut]] thinks my long johns suit me, `/nod`. I think he's right. Assignments. [[TTTOTW]] + LoL Worlds. Peanut butter toast, popcorn, lemon candy, and water. Caffeine. I need to right the ship.

//The Walk// with my sympaticon. A quiet one. Walking is where she  allows herself to hit the grenade; hasn't been able to not use for any extended period. Saw mi amor leaving. Hugs right before she drove off.

[[TTTOTW]]. I'm buying an expensive mouse now. I am not a fan of spending much on anything, even on my beloved [[monster]]. My Das Keyboard has lasted for over a decade, and it's been a wise investment. Considering how much I use my mouse (despite how I've worked to be keyboard-driven), this may be a worthy peripheral to have long-term. I'm not destructive (highly respectful of my machines, insofar as one can to a non-person, and so forth), but I use the fuck out of my mice. If it lasted 5 years, and if it is a cut above the Anker, then it will be worthy. Wireless with wired option, and we'll see if I can make the extras work on Loonix. Back and forward are the critical buttons, as sometimes I've gotta surf one-handed. Browser Tab, Workspace Tab, and Workspace switching on the mouse would also be noice, but I aint gettin' errthang. 

Took old mouse back to UPS. The shipping place here in town is not a full service UPS, so they won't return. Raining a lot today. Did make it to a place I've been before (forgot). Lady at the desk had an odd spark to her. Held my phone out 

Shopping @ Aldi with my sympaticon. Pretty quick. It was early. Two carts, less than $400. Enough TP and paper towels to survive for a couple weeks, ofc.

My sympaticon was upset about the potatoes that she made yesterday, tryin' to contain herself, I think. Unpacking. 

Shopping @ W-Entity. Saw what's-her-face (shit, don't remember) at the deli. Picked up missing pieces for meals. Snack in the car while it rained and the tree colors have changed since we last sat there.

Unpacking. Card supplies have arrived. 

Read //Alphabet of Thorn// to my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]].

Brix pinched from my poop coochie. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Chat with [[T-Money]]. Offspring came down to grind. Slow and quiet, but we got to talk. =). 

Mi amor called. 

[[Family Gathering]] was good. We had fish'n'chips with water. //Mr. Robot//.

Chilled with mi amor. Put her to bed (well, sorta). [[5c0ut]] had a helluva day. I really don't like Phillip. [[5c0ut]]'s surviving. Job is job. 

Sleep by 8. Still trying to shift my sleep schedule.
