How are you?
Jul 23 7:44pm
I'm hanging in there. I've been doing a lot reading and thinking. Trying to make sense of the world, lol.
Jul 23 7:44pm
How about you?
Jul 23 7:44pm
That is a big task
Jul 23 7:44pm
No doubt. Ha, I am feeling the heat.
Jul 23 7:45pm
But, it is good. Everyone is healthy, and we make progress.
Jul 23 7:45pm
I am good —[[AG]] is recovering from wisdom teeth out and [[UJ]] is 47 today
Jul 23 7:45pm
[[AG]] is a sore chipmunk but a good patient
Jul 23 7:46pm
We had dinner tonight with [[K]] and [[L]] —good mexican foods
Jul 23 7:46pm
Glad everyone there is well —does [[k0sh3k]] have a lot of work during this craziness?
Jul 23 7:47pm
Wow. I bet she is sore. How long will it take to heal?
Jul 23 7:48pm
47, fantastic.
Jul 23 7:48pm
They said tomorrow may be the worst but after that pretty quick
Jul 23 7:48pm
Okay. She has anything to help with the pain?
Jul 23 7:49pm
Coldness, I assume is mandatory
Jul 23 7:49pm
Yeah they gave her a head sock with ice packs , ibuprofen and hydrocodone
Jul 23 7:50pm
Excellent. I am glad the mouth heals so fast.
Jul 23 7:51pm
Congratz on being able to have the family together too. I am jelly! Lol.
Jul 23 7:52pm
It's an exceptional gift in 2020.
Jul 23 7:52pm
I have to think about [[k0sh3k]]'s workplace quite a bit. She has to navigate some difficult territory. She's been running point for the other librarians on developing policy (and representing her library with the others who are developing policy).
Jul 23 7:53pm
I do not know how to she is able to do what she does. There is a lot to reason about.
Jul 23 7:54pm
I think it's going to start getting even harder in the next month, but hopefully will cool down within a couple weeks of that.
Jul 23 7:55pm
Yeah it has to be difficult
Jul 23 7:56pm
Our school is down in enrollment right now but it can flex either way depending on parents and public schools
Jul 23 7:56pm
They still want us back in the classroom by the 4th but have made promises like students remaining 6 ft apart when I am not sure how that will happen
Jul 23 7:58pm
I have extremely feelings about that matter.
Jul 23 7:59pm
mixed*
Jul 23 7:59pm
Yeah —I see kids needing back to school but I feel like there is some misrepresentation going on
Jul 23 7:59pm
On a side note my tomatoes are going to takeover...

That is four plants...and they are now in the walkway
Jul 23 8:01pm
That is joyous. Looks amazing.
Jul 23 8:02pm
And my chickens are good children
Jul 23 8:03pm
It's such an awesome way to transform the house.
Jul 23 8:03pm
haha, I bet

How noisy are they at this point?
Jul 23 8:03pm
Not too bad —I don’t have roosters
Jul 23 8:03pm
The little one mostly chirp and a few of the bigger ones cluck but none crow
Jul 23 8:05pm
The one named Lois is the prettiest of the bunch
Jul 23 8:07pm

She’s the brown one
