Apr 11 7:56pm
He is sleeping on me now i think
Apr 11 7:57pm
Yay! =)
Apr 11 7:57pm
Best part of a belly like ours.
Apr 11 7:57pm
Yeah, I can get him to sleep fast now, but cant set him in his bed without him waking up
Apr 11 7:57pm
He getting more active and babbling more?
Apr 11 7:58pm
I actually have his head on my shoulder, his knees against my chest, and his butt on my arm. Like an upright fetal
Apr 11 7:59pm
Super active and babblin
Apr 11 7:59pm
Fast crawl, stands and walks while holding stuff
Apr 11 7:59pm
Amazing and tiring
Apr 11 8:00pm
Babbles with intention (can see when I say daddy, he pauses and purses his lips, then says mommy or something else) although I dont think he connects words to us
Apr 11 8:00pm
Just copies sounds I think
Apr 11 8:00pm
Gonna happen soon enough, I bet.
Apr 11 8:01pm
Yeah, but really glad shelter in place is forcing me to spend so much time with him
Apr 11 8:01pm
It's been a boon for some families to be able to spend time together.
Apr 11 8:02pm
I think path of least resistance is so alluring, almost like a temp dad.  Just when I get home from work
Apr 11 8:02pm
So hard when they are that young too. Just potatoes potating.
Apr 11 8:02pm
Lol
Apr 11 8:03pm
Rofl
Apr 11 8:03pm
Yep
Apr 11 8:03pm
Lil tards being retahded
Apr 11 8:03pm
I know a lot of people prefer the baby babies. I think it gets easier and more rewarding as they get older though (at least so far).
Apr 11 8:04pm
Afk, gonna try to set him down.  Hard to hold him on my forearm and text
Apr 11 8:04pm
