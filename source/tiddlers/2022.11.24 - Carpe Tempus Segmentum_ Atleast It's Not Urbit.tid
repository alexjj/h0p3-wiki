title: 2022.11.24 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Atleast It's Not Urbit

//[[Happy Thanksgiving|https://i.redd.it/h4ut3tsqh02a1.jpg]]. I love you.//

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! Sleep by 1? Woke at 8. Solid sleep. Meditation. [[TTTOTW]]. Chat with the [[ASmith]] crew. Cleaning with my son, chattering with folks in the kitchen. Chat with [[Ignota]].

//The Commons// functions. Got a grow light up for the yaupon. May they make it one more year before we plant them. 

[[MTG]] with my son, then my sympaticon. 

Clarinet. Talked with mi amor about her paper as she was writing. It's good work, and it's interesting seeing how to fit into the machine. I would not be surprised if she went onto publish it. 

Demonsaw demonstrates the problems of the centralization of Federation too well (beyond simple UI/UX of being unable to connect to more than out router at a time, it seems). Router knows your IP, and when you hide it over Tor, you lose the ability to [[share]] files. Why trust the servers this much? Why cede that much ground? The tool wasn't made for [[anonymity]]. Worse, they who control discoverability control who is likely to be heard. Even with turnkey servers, I disagree with this model. [[DarkMX]] does it better (a profound achievement for one person [and someone who can't pay others to do it either]; continued movement toward pure p2p requires steps even Sir zzz cannot; and if these god-tier programmers can't, I can't). It remains unclear to me that Ryft has a real shot at solving the problem; doesn't look like the answer so far. [[Anonymity]] has to be baked right in, and preferably in a way modular to other [[anonymizing]] networks. Make it worth building and using bridges there.

The [[Outopos: DHT]] is the starting place. Until the [[Atropos]] layers can exist, I don't see the point in building on top. The [[Locutus]] foundation may still be critical. I simply cannot argue that the [[Ian Clarke]] doesn't care about [[anonymity]] as he constructs this tool, even if it is not anywhere near such a thing (seeming afterthought). So here you go, [[search_social]], F2F-based  Democratic multiverses built on digital contracts and a world-class DHT (connection bonding at multiple layers, might as well have the gamut of interfaces, several anonymity methods that can be mixed and matched, and ultimately [[shared]] computing resources that does real work being key to why we trust it. I'd like to read and write about this topic with folks. Land I do not own is land on which I'm more likely to be an observer. I am careful about how I colonize and participate as a citizen on [[shared]] land. It's a Robustness Principle application, perhaps.

Given the tradeoffs, The Feds control the entrances at some level. I hope we grow common ground, places upon which we can be fairly constructive together with the few resources we have. We do have to construct DAOs that do proper voting, and ones in which we believe each person is one person (I think the barrier to entry there needs to be pretty high, maybe on the order of even 1% of the work I've put into this ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±). A proper DID can acculumate that much information. Proof of autonomy.

More talkin' with mi amor about her paper. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. //Skintime// with my sympaticon. 

[[Family Time]]. [[5c0ut]] made a feast, and I didn't even touch the desserts. I had two plates. We sprawled and chilled whiling consuming. Parts bittersweet, but overall pleasant. 

Donors called offspring. Short one. Played a game of [[Magic]] with my son. Kept 4 Mana open from turn 4 on (I had a lot of acceleration).  Never had the combo. 

Sleep by 9. Pwned.
