It is easy to [[love]] [[you|https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30008797]].

=D. Dude. I'm very glad to [[meet you|Contact]] and [[share]] feathers. [[Flowers|2019.12.25 - kickscondor: Triage]] and [[butterflies|2021.03.10 - kickscondor: Concrete Tiled Desktop Dogma of Love]] and [[泉 こなた|2019.08.07 - chameleon: Nets 4 Outcasts]] and [[Christ|2021.07.13 - §: A Prayer For The Newborn]] to [[the living|https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27973851]], indeed, [[nomad]]. `/bow`. That might be the highest praise I have ever received in my life. Thank you. Doin' what we can. You clearly know hao [[itdo]].

My bet is that you've tried these before, but in case you haven't:

# https://fraidyc.at/, an open virtual servant of Humanity, can follow HN users and many more too (and you can't get away with something like [[Update Scanner|https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/update-scanner/]] here because of pagination and the expense on your notification system past a certain threshold of following). 
# Though it doesn't always work for me, [[Hacker News Enhancement Suite|https://github.com/etcet/HNES]] might be a reasonable way to have a signal that you've upvoted someone before. 

It is my honor.

Hi h0p3. Thank you. You made my day.
Reviewing your friends list, I agree we're in the same flock. Tangent: I'd love ready access to my personal metrics on HN. Like maybe star or highlight posts from users I've upvoted before. Would definitely like feeds, akin reddit's multireddit feature, so I could easily follow my friend's comments.

I poked around your site, read some of your posts. I think you're a good person who's really trying to be present for your loved ones.

Peace.
