title: 2020.05.06 - Prompted Introspection: DJ Trump indahaus

!! What trait did you admire in another person recently?

Modified from [[2018.08.27 - Prompted Introspection: Admiration]], as it should be more open-ended. This is an important one for me, especially because I'm prone to divide each person I see into parts that I admire and don't. Unfortunately, it is too easy for me to fail to appreciate what is quite MacIntyrianly excellent about an individual. Alright, I'm trying not to puke or kill myself here, but it's time to push the question to its limit: DJ Trump.

What traits do I admire about Donald J. Trump? 

He's not afraid to be different, and he has non-trivially adapted to his mental illnesses and evils. Sometimes his contrarian point of view is correct (at least in part), and he can hold a position that enables him to achieve his ends in a manner that most people would not predict. He's found a way to be media savvy and tell fragmented stories to a variety of people while profoundly relaxing the moral constraints on his ego, and it makes him far more formidable than anyone would like to admit. Of course, we can talk about how he is a symptom, a peg which shockingly fits the hole generated by what appears to be coincidence in our power structures, but he really does believe in his greatness in a way that strikes me as being similar to the disunified version of the virtue of courage. WWF sophistry fueled by alternate-reality maymays just werx, and he knows it; that's a special thing to know and practice so openly. He shows us how truly evil we are. I feel like I owe him a debt of gratitude in this respect. He's helped me realize how much I despise even people who call themselves Democrats;<<ref "i">> putting the nail in the coffin for me (it's been a long time coming).
