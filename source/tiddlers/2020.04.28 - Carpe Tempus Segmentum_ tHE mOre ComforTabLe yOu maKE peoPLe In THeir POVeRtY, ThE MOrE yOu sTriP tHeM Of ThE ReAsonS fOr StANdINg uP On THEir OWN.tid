* Woke at 11
** Not sleeping well enough. Fool.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Walk+Talk with myself
* Read+Write
* Dialectures
* I need to stretch more. Feel it building up in me.
* [[Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση]]: [[Embodied Cognition]]
* Chats
* Walked with muh wife
** Took the extra long route
*** Wife has me on her deaf-side because it was so crowded that it made it difficult to think.
**** Perhaps just better to take walks later than we have been.
** Thinking about how to safely start up the library again.
*** Bunch of hoops to jump through, and it's problematic without having any students to help. She's got a pickle on her hands.
**** I'm glad she has a chance to help shape policies in her meetings. Bunch of libraries at Yale having to figure out a general strategy here.
** Folx have been on the brain.
** Got a cookie
*** Meat was cleared out of the store. 
**** Are my predictions coming true?
***** Also, last w-entity trip, I saw that formula was very low. 
* Dialectures
** And disappointment. 
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Pulled pork and brussel sprouts! =)
** We decided to watch the Season 2 finale of //Westworld//
** I fell asleep during it...
* Sleep by 9?
