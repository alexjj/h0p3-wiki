The velocity of virtual churn explodes as the product and means of production become remote and driven by VC shotguns in which every worker in the stack must continually rejustify their existence.

Media discovery is often not a "viable product" because we've yet to fully and efficiently automate the modeling of each person's evolving sense of [[The Beautiful]] with respect to anything sufficiently complex. I'm not convinced yet that it can be completely automated, but I do think we can build tools that increasingly aid us in hand-picking what is [[salient]].

Psychedelic calm, quieting, the low-energy filtration of outside input, accessing semblances closer in representation to what our sensory organs detect. Hyperbolic geometry is the translation of being overwhelmed by sensory input. Our sense organs, in some cases, detecting differences in intensities rather than intensities themselves. Apprehend difference against a recursive pattern. Fringes on the periphery of some of our [[phenomenology]] maintain the remaining raw input to fill in the gaps.
