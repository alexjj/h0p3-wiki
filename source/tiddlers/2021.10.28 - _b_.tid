"Works well under pressure" is another way of saying "will submit to being yelled at" to signal the superiority of my overlords (customers included). Yes, please pay me slave wages to represent you as being better than who you are as a person, boss.

Here's the dirtiest Occam's I know: none of it is real, none of it matters, it's all made up, it's an illusion, there is only correlation, you have no access to truth or its bearers: you are an observer of your own self-constructed incoherence and nothing more. Anti-realist solipsism is the fastest, simplest answer and egoism an evolutionarily fit (though not fitting) perspective by many metrics. [[gfwiwcgws]].

Into [[infinigress]], I agree that every object and process requires an anterior metastructure to protect it from a dialectical void where consistent multiplicity is sutured to inconsistent multiplicity, a continuum problem that we can only ever empirically approximate, paradoxically into reconstructions of the noumena [[itself]]. Even the state of the void is counted in the totality. I know nothing, Socrates.
