title: 2021.03.03 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Freestyle Sleeping Pattern

[[TTTOTW]] + Vapelyfe. Hummus. 

Picked up Sunflower Lecithin, MCT Oil, and Lube. Missing pieces for the tincture, and it won't hurt your throat. Easy to dose, sublingual, faster than an edible too (though it won't taste great). 

Freestyle sleeping pattern on shuffle. Fireman Time!

[[TTTOTW]], mostly weak-ass surfing. Also, note, Auto Text Expander malware. 

[[chameleon]] showing me her upcoming build. God damn, it's expensive. Sexy AF too (Lian Li cases do that). Lawd! Just my unrequested random thoughts, in case it would be useful: I'd just wait on the GPU, pickup something cheap to hold you over (you are dealing with extortionist rates! [I pray to goddess they come down]). Interesting going pure SSD for storage though (hawt). I'd still go 2+ HDDs for colder storage (they can match the speeds of a sata SSD in many tasks, especially if you pool them together) and 1+ NVME 
 (you'll have backups and you won't be slurping through the sata straw). If you are going to have 128 GB of RAM (and, if I had the money, I'd do that too!), you might as well have a Ryzen 7 (it's unlikely you'll burn that much RAM, even with heavy browser abuse [tends to be light on CPU use] without wishing you had more CPU to go with it [cue compiling XKCD swordfight, but Golang doesn't have this problem, sadly =/]). Consider watercooling, and it's a shame not to passthrough in your shoes especially, I think. 

Offspring went on a walk without me. Glad they took the initiative. Hugs'n'bugs, slung cards with 'em. Discussions of socializing with my son, and Ruth + [[The Great Human Conversation]] + history of the Catholic Church as a political entity with my daughter. Son's crushing at the game. Ranga sat on the cards (big cat takes up almost the entire battlefiele, homefry needed attention) as we petted him and played from memory.

[[TTTOTW]] + Offline Hunting (that'll be a yikes from me, dawg)

Dialectures, Come to Jesus, and so forth and so on. A million times. You know what I think, and I will say it again. I am willing to think carefully about our disagreement if you'd like. `/sigh`. 

Cleaning and organizing. Laundry. Made the drive for my daughter (fastest way to skin this cat). `/salute`. Forgot, need cheesecloth (or those one tools, I forget whatchercallem) and the aeropress. Have everything we need otherwise, delivered in 16 hours (wow!).

[[Family Gathering]], scrounged, Scout's sleeping but joined us, I had fried rice (dope) and more stealing nips of her drank (:P). Son was feeling quiet, back to everyone, too much of me today (fair enough), but joined in eventually. My wife recounted her day and we thought about the surprise meeting with her boss's boss's boss. It's probably about Le Kevin. I hope she has the time in the morning to prep for the meeting. You have documentation (two sets too, one to guide the other). It's a rare event, and you are always auditioning. There's a string of retirements coming. Positioning begins now. You don't have the status of these people, but your competence shines. Already, some rally behind you! =)

Repairing the ghetto walls in my room. It's going to take multiple passes, and it won't be perfect still. Meh. As long as it works.
