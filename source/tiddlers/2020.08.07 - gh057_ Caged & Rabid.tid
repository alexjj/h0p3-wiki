I'm hanging in there. Easing off my offspring as much as I can to give them space. Lots of reading and writing.

Yes and getting people hired has been tough. The task has been overwhelming...plus working at the school started
I hope they are doing well. They are good kids. How's [[k0sh3k]] doing?

How are the folks at the school feeling about re-opening?
Aug 7 2:10pm
[[k0sh3k]]'s stressed. Been a clusterfuck trying to open the library.
Aug 7 2:11pm
Very perplexed. They put off starting till Aug 17th. They are going for 1vweek and then all virtual.  The teachers are trying to learn how this is gonna work. They are not trained in virtual. 
I hope she calms and things starts flowing well.

[[k0sh3k]] got her CV19 test, and she was negative. Higher levels of dizziness. Teenage emotions are much stronger than I anticipated. Everyone is getting sleep though (that's a change for us).
Aug 7 2:48pm
I'm glad [[k0sh3k]] was negative. Teenagers are like a caged animal with rabies sometimes. ðŸ˜‚. I don't miss it lol
