!! How has your health been this week?

* 1uxb0x
** Acne issues and sleep issues, otherwise normal.
* j3d1h
** good. need to remember my vitamins.
* k0sh3k
** Adjusting to the new meds; now taking full dose. I think it's helping with some things, but my sleep is still all over the place and my head feels too busy. Also, one full-blown panic attack and some small headaches... Hopefully, it'll all even out over the next week or so. 
* h0p3
** Sleep has been all over the place. I am getting enough though. I did have that migraine without the pain. Weird.
* ASK
** I'm okay. Overall improving.

!! What was interesting to you last week?

* Talking with [[BDS97]]. 
* [[Monsternix]] and a lot of p2p technologies
* //House of Cards//, //Dresden Files//, //Party Down//, //ATLA//
* It was a very long week of getting all the physical stuff done at the library - shelving and transfers, mostly - as well as hiring student staff and doing search committee meetings... 
* The chapel stole //two// of my student staff! Dang! 
* Had a //very// long talk with CH. 
* My week has been alright, I've been trying out a few codebases I want to host for Space station 13/14 content, and currently choosing between two incompatible ones. I've gotten my work done this week, which was good, although I only just moved on from slopes in name (still messing with them a bit.) into functions!
* kinda ending up in a support position for all my closest friends. that's alright, they're getting better :)
* decided to just start drawing backgrounds, since theory has been boring me to death.
