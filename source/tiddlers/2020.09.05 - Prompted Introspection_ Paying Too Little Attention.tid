title: 2020.09.05 - Prompted Introspection: Paying Too Little Attention

!! Complete this thought: "I wish I had paid more attention when..."

Oh god, Samwise, this question is insane. I don't even know where to begin. I am simply never wise enough with my {[[Focus]]}. The mistakes I've made are legion. Ugh. I'll go with fun ones for now.

I wish I had paid more attention to getting asked to get coffee. I didn't care for coffee for most of my life (warm beverages are disgusting to me). I'm lucky to be married to [[k0sh3k]]. I'm glad she didn't interpret my idiocy as disinterest. I wish I knew how to escape my literal mindedness and preoccupation with precision appropriately.
