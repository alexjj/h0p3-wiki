title: 2021.01.22 - Prompted Introspection: Signs of The Universe

!! What are the signs that someone understands you uniquely?

This is an emotional and quite imperfect answer.<<ref "c">>

Oh,<<ref "s">> when they can pick out the lines in [[review]] (or anywhere else on the wiki for that matter :P) that only they can decode. In some cases, when they make private sacrificial moves on your behalf that could not have been made without enormous empathy. When they can interpret your [[gibberish|hlexicon]], when they defend your unpopular view, when they care about your words when no one else does, when they see past your syntax errors (when they correct them too followed up by realtalk), bridge the gaps for you, finish your sandwiches, and so forth. When they know there's something there with you even when no one can put words to it. When they can not only pass a semblance of an ideological turing test but feel the weight of your beliefs and desires in their own. When they are quick to say they don't know what you are thinking and feeling, but they still regularly benevolently behave as one who does (even if only subconsciously).

You know who you are.
