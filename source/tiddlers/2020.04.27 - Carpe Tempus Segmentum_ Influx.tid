title: 2020.04.27 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Influx

* Woke at 11
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Walk+Talk with myself
* Dialectures
* Some cleaning
** Offspring got the kitchen done
* Chats
* [[Wiki Audit]] work on everyone's wikis. 
* Son and I talked about the tool he's building. `/fingers-crossed`
** I know it feels high pressure for him.
* Walked with wife
** Park is becoming more gorgeous.
** There was a really fucked up part of the walk though, the beginning. We noticed huge traffic lines (we've never seen them like this before).
*** Person walking behind us talked about it. It was for the foodbank at the school.
*** Pigs rolled and squealed that there was no more food left. Some people had been there for a long time.
**** The ration lines are here.
** Felt lucid today.
** Talked with store owner. Shitty capitalist answers to my questions. Asshole.
*** Business is only down 20% for him though (picked back up after initial hype), and I was surprised (revenue much lower though).
**** I am surprised he spoke with me about the matter too. I'm homeless looking, lol. Wonder what was going through his head.
** I met a sleeping angel.
*** They have a card and more now. 
* Talked with [[JRE]]
** Walked me through his encounter and paper
** Talked some about his work.
** Dude is down like 10lbs. That's fucking crazy.
* Dialectures
* Pulled pork was prepped too late =/...plan B.
* Met a person who went by the name [[telos]] today.
** `/wave`
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Played some card game, the DnD-tictactoe-roshambo-shootsnladders pretense of shuffling cardboard to tell stories with each other.
*** Glad I was there. I didn't realize I was a druid, so I had to immediately kill myself. =D.
* Massive influx of [[FTO]] today. 
** [[kicks]]' post pops immediately for me.
*** He leaves so many details (or I'm imagining things, I can never be sure, lol)
*** Those words came out of my mouth, but they are just as much his as mine.
**** I'd argue he's been far more direct about that thesis than I have.
***** Though, I think we may be running with the thesis differently, I cannot see.
* [[vidyas]]: Category Theory stuff...Eugenia Cheng is hawt (having a hard time paying attention ;P; she's skilled at delivery too, can't put my finger on it right...wish my offspring could learn directly from her (gawdayum)).
** I should have shown them in the correct order. My daughter and I had dialectic about tackling the unknown. She was getting stressed that she didn't fully understand what was being said (not like I did either, we had to watch it twice, and still didn't have it down clean). 
*** When will she learn to be fearless? 
**** I'm worried she wouldn't branch out on her own in curiosity to push the limits. 
***** Fuck it, at least I've exposed her to it. The next round will not feel so scary.
* [[h0p3ful Review]]: both stayed to listen to the other's...neat.
* [[vidyas]]: Tiktok garbage 4 lyfe
* Walk+Talk with myself
* Put away the pork. It's done. Nobody to eat it. Lol. Tomorrow we will feast.
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 4
** Idiot.
