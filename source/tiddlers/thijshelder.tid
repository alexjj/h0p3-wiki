** 36, "rugged dude," "redneck/hillbilly," "a 'stereotypical' masculine guy; I hunt, fish, hike, camp, watch football (go Titans!)," from Southern Appalachia, just came out to his mom as gynosexual ("never had any sexual experience with the same sex, although I would like to") 3 months ago.
*** Sexually attracted, but not romantically to men, and perhaps not women either ("skeptical of relationships"). Has tried being romantically attracted so as not "to be seen as 'sex crazed.'"

** "I agree with that. I think Marx has become a buzzword for liberals who basically just want to fit in and appear as though they are revolutionary."
** "Endless 'intersectionality' might be the best way I have seen it put. That is honestly how I feel. I went to a really good university in the northeastern US (sorta regret it) and my dad told me I was their 'poor white trash quota.' I thought he was just being a jerk, but after moving there, I found out he was pretty spot on and that when I genuinely asked questions about poor folks, these 6-figure-a-year professors did not care too much. Their endless intersectionality appeared to just intersect with themselves and other bourgeois nonsense, and rarely intersected with working people. I fear individualism is ingrained into these professor's minds to the point they cannot abandon it."
** "That makes sense. I come from a pretty poor family but was able to get a Master's Degree. Seeing some professors rarely care anything about poor working class people while claiming Marxism sorta turned me off to them. At the same time, however, this is where I learned most about Marxism. I guess I am a little conflicted."
** "However, I am curious if anyone could explain to me what 'authoritarianism' and 'totalitarianism' means under something like Marxism-Leninism. To put this into a better perspective, I am from the US and have been taught individualism my entire life, but after studying Marx for a few years, I think the outcome he wanted was for individuals to ultimately be free. I guess a different 'individualism' than the bourgeois Western one that sees selfishness as a virtue. I appreciate any help. Thanks."
** "I have noticed this with many 'woke' 'progressives' too. They do not want to abolish the power structure, they simply want to reverse it into their favor. Bourgeois socialists indeed."
** "I do not have a solid answer (yet); however, when I was at seminary, I wrote many papers on Christian socialism. I grew up a semi-fundamentalist Christian and thought anything with the word 'socialism' in it meant evil. Then I took a deep dive into early Christianity and its collectivist nature while it also appreciated the individual in the eyes of God. I then dove deeper into the Anabaptists. Point is: I think that the Abrahamic Religions can keep their uniqueness while embracing socialism and appreciating others, whether they are religious or not. I wish you well in your studies and if I come across anything on Islamic socialism, then I will let you know (I have a few ideas but am too busy today with family stuff to do research)."
** "We are not allowed in the country club. I am also disturbed about how mainstream media makes the LGBT community look like they are perfect. Even us within this community that speak out about the hatred from within are silenced. I am tired of it. There is very little inclusion in the modern LGBT community. Personally, I am out of the LGBT stuff and will never go back. I do not need that tribalism in my life."
** "I am a musician. I actually once got to record in Nashville, which was awesome. I haven't played in years now because it is so depressing to know what you love brings you no way of surviving."
