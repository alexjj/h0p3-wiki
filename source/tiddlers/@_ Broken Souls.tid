I beg you ignore what I say, ask, and do unless it pleases you. I'm a talkative person, and it's expensive speaking with me sometimes. 

> [Theta] Nice to meet you too, h0p3. You sent in a lot of questions, so we won't be grabbing the camera for this. I'll just write down who said what for ya.

Oh, that's fine with me. I'm a paranoid man who tries to avoid cameras (like John, perhaps) at almost all costs (it gets harder to do each year). Only [[Root User]]s or strangers in need may ask to see my face (mine is pretty ugly, so people normally don't want to see it). I much prefer text to other kinds of images to get to know people anyway. I hope you don't mind that I prefer speaking in (and from my) ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 so very much. From my perspective, I'm speaking to you from [[my|Monster]] [[computer|Computing]]. How do you hear me? How do you know I said these words to you?

> [Bow] Ask anything!

What things matter most in our lives, and how do you know it's true?

> [John] I don't give a shit what you ask either.

Okay. Why don't you give a shit what I ask?

> [Bow] I am Bow Tie Julip!

What is the most fitting occasion for wearing a bowtie? How long does it take you to tie one? I can't tie one at all.

> [Theta] Theta Kenton here. I was named after the little glowy trinket round my neck - more on that in a minute.

Is it a family heirloom? How did your namers decide that trinket was worth naming you after?

> [Bow] I enjoy happy stories with happy endings.

Yes, sir. Are there happy stories without happy endings? What makes it happy? Who should be happy?

> [John] I enjoy horror stories and fantasy books.

Braver than I am. I cannot handle horror, at all. What stories and books in particular would you recommend to me? Do you have any that you have enjoyed multiple times? Have you ever read //The Hobbit//? That book is dope! I can get you a copy, if you'd like one.

> [Theta] I like all kinds of stories, especially the ones that prove a point.

Oh, you, I like you. Straight to the point: do you know what the point of this story is? Will you be able to prove it?

> [Bow] The 4th wall? Looks like any other wall to me.

Hrm. Yeah, I appreciate that. All walls do have something in common. I like to call it "wall-ness," the essence that all walls [[share]] in common to some [[dok]]. I'm just making conversation (I'm not good at it), so we can can think about something else. What do you like to think about?

> [John] Why the fuck are you talking about walls?

Curiosity. Hoping there's more to the world than [[mere|https://i.redd.it/xw1d233s5b571.jpg]] walls. 

> [Theta] I prefer seeing writers that keep it intact.

Lawd. I know that feel. What do you think about the relationship between and natures of coherence (internalism, top-down), accuracy (externalism, bottom-up), and salience (what is relevant in all contexts filtered to your particular context)?

> [Bow] Hosting is rather wonderous!

What's wonderous about it? How long have you been doing it? 

> [John] I'm in the mood for you leavin' me the fuck alone.

I [[aim]] to give you space then, my friend. I'm always listening if you need to speak.

> [Theta] Thanks for the nickname, I guess... And if you mean the amulet, it's sorta like a magic battery, holding extra power that I'm not using right now.

No problem, ΘθϑϴᶿⲐⲑѲѳ𝚯𝛉𝚹𝛝𝛩𝜃𝛳𝜗𝜣𝜽𝜭𝝑𝝝𝝷𝚹𝞋𝞗𝞱𝜭𝟅. Again, it's a pleasure to meet you. I heard [[this story|https://bookwyrm.quest/#The%20Importance%20of%20Names]] about the [[power]] of [[names]]. What's in a name, Theta? Is it related to that amulet? Is it alive or does it contain life? How does it replenish? How is it used, and when would you use it? Have you ever used it? Do you consider that item "overpowered" in any sense? What is the nature of power sources more generally? What's it worth to you? Have you ever encountered anything else like it? I often chew on my necklaces: does that one taste good or have a good mouth feel?

> [Bow] What's a "based"?
> [John] I'm confused.
> [Theta] Is this a riddle or somethin? You need to work on your jokes, dude.

[[This|https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=based]] and [[that|https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justep-foundational/]] are what I mean by based, fellow kids (perhaps the opposite of cringe). Wait, are you kids or how old are you? How old do you feel?

> [Bow] Multiverse plus what?
> [John] Multi-what-now?

My good people, you must forgive a madman for speaking his gibberish in broken words. Maybe Theta will translate for us. It might not be worth the time though. I am, after all, an insane person. =D.

> [Theta] If you meant THE multiverse, then yeah, I'm not even from this universe. If you mean the website, though, I've never seen it til now. Looks like it's broken.

Oh, I'm sure some souls would think it broken. Just look a bit deeper, and you'll see something rising inside. I wouldn't be surprised to find multiverse.plus accessible from your universe, strangers. I know they would be quite welcoming and nice. Here's a link to an artist: https://multiverse.plus/phx/sumain (also, check the very bottom out, you can sign up for an account). Maybe you should crosspost there.

What it do, my ninjas? I'm [[h0p3]]. It's a pleasure to meet you. I [[like]] your stylish font and your faces. What kinds of questions am I supposed to ask you, Broken Souls? Tell me about your names. What draws you to stories? What do you think about what some call The 4th Wall? What do you think about hosting, Bow? What are you in the mood for, John?
