How's life going?
Jul 31 5:00pm
my phone got smashed, not be me :P
Aug 2 10:08am
you ken anything about blackview BV models versus Ulefone Armor? Both 'rugged' phones
Aug 2 10:08am
Was going to just replace what i have (htc one m9) as already have the case and the phone is sufficient, but they're actually more expensive than tehse waterproof deals (I ken, 'waterproof', i've read about the I68/69 rating or whatever)
Aug 2 10:09am
and because my waterproof camera broke last year? year before? i'd love to have something I could get oot on the boat or the beach
Aug 2 10:09am
both get quite good reviews... looks like I can get higher spec for my money with ulefone. Let me know?
Aug 2 10:09am
and why are there older phones with newer OSs? fucking lame
Aug 2 10:12am
with a phone, how much difference does it make between a quad and and octa core processor?
Aug 2 10:31am
these are what i've shortlisted on amazon. gonnae check ebay

Found the blackview for Â£110 https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Blackview-BV5900-Rugged-Mobile-Phone-Android-9-0-3GB-32GB-NFC-IP68-5580mAh-5-7/184378028009?epid=18036107986&hash=item2aedc96fe9%3Ag%3A%7EncAAOSwxe5eoCWq&LH_ItemCondition=1000

From what I can tell, only benefit of the blackview over others is the battery. It's Android 9 in stead of 10, and has 3ram instead of 4...
Aug 2 10:43am
I'm going for this one unless you have reasons I should not! :) https://smile.amazon.co.uk/dp/B088ZLH74L/?coliid=I1XS257GVR53TW&colid=5U2JB8HLGCMQ&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it

I'm not terribly knowledgeable about phones, sadly. That one looks reasonable to me. 4GB of RAM has been enough for me for many years on my phone, but I do my best not to use the device.
Aug 2 11:41am
That one is rootable too.
Aug 2 11:41am
Not sure if it matters for you, but you might need to check if it works with your carrier.
Aug 2 11:43am
I like that the phone is meant to take a beating. I ended up having to get a case for mine like that.
Aug 2 11:43am
i t hink it'll be fine - it's unlocked
Aug 2 12:13pm
so should work with any carrier. I can just put in my sim card
Aug 2 12:13pm
What's 'rootable' mean?
Aug 2 12:40pm
It basically means that you have more control of the machine, you'll be able to install and use software that isn't normally allowed.
Aug 2 1:07pm
It might not be important to you.
Aug 2 1:08pm
oh i see. no probably not, but still good to ken
Aug 2 1:12pm
how are you? good weekend?
Aug 2 1:12pm
I've been fine. Taking care of [[k0sh3k]]. She's had an epic migraine this weekend. She's still not great today, but she's here.
Aug 2 1:13pm
Just worried about her. She has been really stressed.
Aug 2 1:13pm
Aye, she was telling me :( I'm sorry to hear about the migraine! as if that's needed on top of the rest :(
Aug 2 1:14pm
No doubt.
Aug 2 1:14pm
well i just read a review on tech radar, i'm gonnae go for the phone
Aug 2 1:20pm
please give [[k0sh3k]] a hug from me :)
Aug 2 1:28pm
Done. =)
Aug 2 2:21pm
I'm digging Heilung more and more. It's a good song that I want to leave on repeat for hours.
Aug 2 2:23pm
And they have a couple that strong.
Aug 2 2:23pm
i know, right? bit crazy.
bit crazy all they are and all they've brought into our lives. Weird.

But I'm glad you're digging it! What tunes you most into?
Aug 2 3:49pm
Does [[k0sh3k]]/the kids like it at all?
Aug 2 3:49pm
They are annoyed that I like to leave the same song on. That's how I often test a song.
