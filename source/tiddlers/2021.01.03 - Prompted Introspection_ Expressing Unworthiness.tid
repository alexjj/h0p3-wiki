title: 2021.01.03 - Prompted Introspection: Expressing Unworthiness

!! Could you have a serious relationship with someone who expressed that they thought they were unworthy of the relationship?

That's a really weird question, Samwise. It's a very narrow one too. I take you to be using the existential quantifier here, and I have a broad concept of the possibilities of people in our domain. Note further that just because someone expressed it does not entail they mean it, nor that they aren't actually worthy, and so on.<<ref "w">> 

All else being equal, yes. Nobody is actually going to do that, btw, lol. I would argue with them about that. 

I suppose it also depends on how you define "serious" here. There are limits to any relationship; and there's only so much I can do to build the bridge. There are places where I am difficult to approach, but I work hard to combat that, [[WINTCIS]]. Still, the conditions can be met in at least some cases.
