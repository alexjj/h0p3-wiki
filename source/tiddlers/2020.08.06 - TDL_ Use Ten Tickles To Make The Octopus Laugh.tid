title: 2020.08.06 - TDL: Use Ten Tickles To Make The Octopus Laugh

* Assuming you can, Costco. You need it.
* Teenagers need showers.
* [[FTO]] Check-ins.
* I'd like you to lay off your penis some. You have a triple-crown event the coming day (well, an attempt ;P). 
* Look, you aim to make the stars align here. They should have machines that allow them to work on their wikis.
** IP updates.
** What if the battery life is just fucking terrible?
*** Run the cord along the couch, loser. 
*** Replacements would be fine too. 
* I know it's scrounge night, but maybe those pork chops should be used.
** See what people want.
