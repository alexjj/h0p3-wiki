Which objects in the world hijack your mind to any [[dok]] without sufficient justification?

Standardly defined [[civility]] favors those who don't reveal their true motives, emotions, or intentions.

I'm not a fan of dehumanizingly being called a bot or an NPC by anyone who I don't know, but I'm kinda enjoying being told I'm retarded or that I don't know shit. Yes. `/nod`. You got me, my ninja. And, my god, if I don't, then what in the fuck do you know? Lol. I know dividing by zero is hard.

There comes a time and place in discourse where justified epistemic authority does not rest upon standard citation. This is a social version of The Foundation problem. Academia is a useful risk distribution tool, but the hardest problems are fundamentally narratival, qualitative, poetic, and based upon each creature's [[phenomenology]]. Trust begins and ends outside the scope of specified consensus and vetted sources of source-vetting. That the majority can always be wrong is why free speech is crucial even under Ideal Liquid Democracy (which, it turns out, the Rule of Law might function a helluva lot like a [[Straussian]] Hegelian Constitutional Monarchy if he could understand the machines that are possible to construct [and, maybe he did; it's unclear that anyone is qualified to speak on the matter]).
