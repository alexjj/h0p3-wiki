!! Audit:

* My wife does a fine job of providing or emulating a more standard schooling. I often feel like it's my job to emulate the world, capitalism included, to prepare them for the insanity of the jungle outside our bubble. 
** Ignorance may be bliss, of course.
* [[CTS]] + [[Wiki Review]] at a weekly timelice for everyone. What are these stories together?
* It's ridiculously hard to engage in this kind of log with //just// wikis. Remote is way, way harder (some might say impossible). 
** I have no idea how to plan for that well enough. It was absurd in NC. 
* I don't think my offspring are taking into account their mental health enough in these answers.
* As long as we are clear: I am dog. Lol.
* Struggles in making sure the log was put together completely, but it has flowed for us.
* It continues to evolve over the years. I'm not sure where else to take it. So much {{Text Art: 𝕱𝕴𝕽𝕰🔥}} in here.
