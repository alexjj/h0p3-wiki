title: 2022.06.18 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Push

[[TTTOTW]]. Thinkin' about China. Hard to find good information on when they are pulling the trigger in the coming decades. Seems like more and more of the appearance of a legal framework and rhetoric for it is coming out, setting up expectations for it. Prepped for the trip. Some packing. Mi amor has my bag. Chat with a /g/entooman.

Shower. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Sleep by 3.

Woke at 6:30. Mi amor is up. Neither of us can sleep. Applying. Prep for the job this afternoon. Coffee. [[TTTOTW]]. 

Hit the post office for [[Lauraceae]].

Shopping @ W-Entity with my sympaticon. Comforts for her. Saw the neighbors with 3 boys there. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Packing. Assignments. 

Delivery came in. Smok Nord 4 with RPM 1.2 ohm quartz coils. Toyed with it. Tried to widen the syringe tip just a tad. Eventually set up a rudimentary station (I need to smooth this out). My sympaticon helped me as it got out of hand (shit is so fucking sticky, and I don't handle hot things well). Loading the glass syringe from the back works, and the coffee hotplate was just enough heat. Silicon everything from now on. Unfortunately, even with pressure, there was a leak on the bottom (not much wasted though). With enough heat and alcohol, it worked. Did our best to wick it in stages. Don't want to burn out coils, but we'll see. My sympaticon did the testing, as I couldn't hit today. No sleep, too much work to do, have to drive, and the fucking fumes. It works. 4.5ml per pod. That's pretty amazing. I'm a slow user too, so that should last me a good while. Battery is not nearly as good as the Voopoo (nor is the mod as adjustable*). The custom coils and ~~tank~~ pod just fucking work though.

My son and I worked for several hours to prepare the tub. It's old and in bad shape. This still might not work. Went to paint, and this shit is toxic. Definite brain damage and asthma interactions. It cleared everyone out of the house too (and I took all the precautions I could with what I had). I worked as fast as I could to paint, and it's flawed. I'd rather save at least a few braincells.

[[TTTOTW]]. Watched some terribly sad shit about China with my sympaticon. One of things I respect about her is that she is very clear that it is our duty to be witnesses, however painful it may be. It's our job, especially as outliers. 

The 4 Amigos sat in the back, in our chairs, with Ranga (and the squirrel). Wandered a lot. Also talked about the [[letter]] to [[The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum]], rabbitholes deep into philosophy, teleosemantics, mathematical logic, Platonism, [[other]] minds. 

Drove to the train station. Walked inside. God damn that thing is fancy. Bunch of rich folks here. Paced until she called and saw her. Eventually let her go. Running on fumes and caffeine today. Found her favorite burger joint up here too, neat. SZ plans to retire in 2-3 years (after director and the position above are filled), and she's pushing for mi amor to take her position, trying to get all pieces into place, introductions, etc. The conference didn't really teach anything new; it's still just paper tokens and relationships. Mi amor was told by several that she need not continue presenting, as it's too much work. The proof has been made. Still need to meet these people in person. There's only 50ish people she really needs to know. Open source librarian expert hookup too.

[[Family Gathering]] was a surprise. We even had food, prepared by my sympaticon. Noodles with a sauce that reminded me of gravy (can't put my finger on it) and brats with sourdough, mustard, and kraut. Water too. We watched the Wilson's Actor Son episode of //House//. 

//Skintime// with mi amor. She toast. Put her bed. 

//Skintime// with my sympaticon. We were both exhausted. Gonna wake her up before I leave if she's not already up. I almost fell asleep instantly, but then rumination kicked in. Tending to my tenant.<<ref "n">>
