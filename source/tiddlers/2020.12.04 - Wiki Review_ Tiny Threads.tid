title: 2020.12.04 - Wiki Review: Tiny Threads

* [[2020.12.03 - Prompted Introspection: Not Trusting Oneself]]
** Samwise, stahp! Please. Lol. 
** Kinda nifty to feel it valuable to dig into the wiki more generally, even if they are only tiny threads.
* [[2020.12.03 - Wiki Review: Dealing]]
** They are often the best part of my day too. I experience probably the greatest range of emotions with them, including over what I otherwise encounter on my [[monster]]. 
** I still haven't dismantled [[monster-16]]'s desk. I can move everything but the desk itself myself (no one is touching my darling). 
* [[2020.12.03 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: More Packing]]
** There's not much to say about any particular things I did, but there's something to say about the day in general. Better than [[CTS]] two years ago. I'll take it. =)
