** It kinda feels like our routines have disintegrated some in the past couple weeks.

** We did start it early, and I'm glad. We needed that time. They were able to get to bed on time.
*** Although, at midnight I heard a loud sound that indicated one child was up. I was surprised to find it was my son who was up late instead playing [[vidya]]. =). Good times. Now get ur ass to bed, lol.
