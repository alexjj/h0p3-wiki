title: 2020.11.25 - Wiki Review: WEIRDWASP

* [[2020.11.24 - Wiki Review: Existential Thots]]
** Completed. I should lower my desires down to my predictions here. The odds of finding anyone who will want to speak with us at length are vanishingly small. Better to just not offend and blend in a bit better. 
*** We have tons of vanilla WEIRD WASP attributes and appearances. Can just ride dat privilege.
* [[2020.11.24 - Prompted Introspection: Fucking Autist]]
** Completed. Not being able to connect on what I value with others makes it pretty lonely too. This ability would probably entail being a profound communicator. That would be dope. The wiki gives that to some degree, but it's, of couse, never complete.

** I think I did get some sleep. I felt less zombified than I normally would have. The chillpill day.

** I don't think gaming is what he's really after though. It's a connection point for us. But, we're getting older, I guess. I am rarely as good at picking out things for [[others]] as they are for me.

** This is kinda dumb. One thing I've been doing more these past few years has been just reading through people's accounts as microblogs shotgunned across contexts. I wish I could point to the posts of banned accounts on many platforms, but that's part of the punishment sometimes. Some of them I wish were still posting to some [[dok]].

** I've accidentally created this one enough times. Fuck it. I use it often. Perhaps there is something to write about it as well. That is what I'm shooting for anywho, right?
