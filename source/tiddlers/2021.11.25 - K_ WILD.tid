Happy Thanksgiving [[h0p3]]! Hope you and your family are doing well. :)
Happy Thanksgiving, [[K]]!
It's going well. It's a chill day.
How about you guys? How are you doing?
Doing the big shindig at the church?
My parents cancelled at the twilight hour. Youngest brother has had a respiratory infection so they are being cautious. So it’s me, the in-laws, my sister and her fiancé. We are all vaccinated so that is good. 

I have SO many things to tell you about student teaching once I get back to a computer haha. It’s been WILD, [[h0p3]]. XD
What are you all gonna make and do today?
I am very excited to hear, sir!
I'ms orry about the infection. How's he holding up?
Hopefully next year will not be as covid problematic as these last two.
I'm doing jackshit, lol. I'm making farts, love, and noises on my keyboard.
Nobody would take my suggesting (begging) to just get Chinese. They all want to do a big T-day thing (and, I'm not gonna complain about gettin' to eat, ofc).
It's been a good day.
He’s getting better, but my folks (after a year of not caring) now want to be cautious about COVID. Which is nice, except they are still having all of our normal family over sans us. Which is weird, but ehhh. 

Chinese for thanksgiving sounds lovely. Reminds me of A Christmas Story, every time. Lol.
I hope you eat until the belt breaks!
