** I dislike that the competitive advantages I can see in GPT-3 are profoundly immoral. It's still a learning toy prototype except insofar as it's a weapon. It does pass the turing test for a large enough percentage of people that it can nudge and disrupt large scale pretty cheaply. 
*** After the model's expensive creation, execution for 20 pages of output costs a single cent. The expensive part is mapping it into social settings and steering. This is the thing that is shown publically (well, on invite, and to an API + discussion), and OpenAI doesn't even have nearly the same firepower that Google or the US military is throwing at this broader space.
*** Increasingly, I must ask myself if I am speaking with a bot.

** I think I'd rather get drunk. My offspring are driving me crazy. My son, in particular, has taken me to the edge. I'm doing what I can to create some space at this point.

** I am more glad to be alive now than I have been in a long time.

** She's had them since she was a young girl. I wish there was a solution. This sucks. =(. 
*** I'm really glad that it semi-broke into delirium though.
