You: HellO!
Stranger: yow
You: What brings you here today?
Stranger: tell me you're not a bot
You: I am not a bot.
You: I can prove that.
You: If you need.
Stranger: i'm just bored
Stranger: you?
Stranger: what brings you here?
You: I hear that. What do you like to do when you aren't bored?
You: I'm here to [[Find The Other]].
Stranger: no i just need someone to talk to
Stranger: i'm at work and bored
You: Oh, cool. I'm down to talk.
You: What do you want to talk about?
Stranger: anything
Stranger: what are you up to?
You: What do you do for work?
Stranger: i'm a dev
Stranger: web dev
You: I'm engaged in the task I said: https://philosopher.life/#Find%20The%20Others
You: Dope.
You: Do you enjoy your position?
Stranger: yeah kinda
Stranger: how bout you?
Stranger: what do you do?
You: I read and write about what matters most, to the best of my knowledge. I speak with people. I'm a philosopher who works pro bono at this point.
You: I'm very interested in the web too, btw.
You: I'm kinda a linkslut. You have any links that you adore? I will be sure to visit them.
You: What do you like and dislike about your position? Do you get to work remote lately?
You: We can talk about whatever is interesting to you, btw. I'm just shootin' the shit. I tend to be too talkative.
Stranger has disconnected.

You both like Web.
You: Hello!
Stranger: hi there hello
You: =)
Stranger: tell me you're not a bot
You: Did we just have a conversation?
You: I am not a bot.
You: I can prove that.
Stranger: ok
Stranger: i dunno got disconnected
You: Ah. Omegle is buggy.
You: Sadly.
Stranger: are u the one talking about other
You: Yup. That's me!
Stranger: just a while ago?
Stranger: omg
You: Pretty cool to reconnect immediately after.
Stranger: haha. so what now?
Stranger: are you from us?
You: I am from the US. Lived all around. How about you?
Stranger: from PH actually
You: Oh, noice. Originally, or you an expat?
Stranger: no i'm a filipino.
You: I lived in Thailand for a few years, long ago.
Stranger: i was born here. :D
You: How do you like it out there?
You: I've never had the pleasure of visiting.
Stranger: you should try. there's a lot of beautiful places here.
You: If I can find a way to do it, I will. I'm kinda a cheapskate. It's expensive to travel. I do most of my traveling through my [[monster]] (https://philosopher.life/#Monster-%CE%A6).
Stranger: so you were in thai for what? "business" haha
You: I was a teacher, and I helped start an orphanage to get children out of sex trafficking.
Stranger: omg. i was just kidding
You: Oh, well, I take people literally. It's part of my autistic nature.
Stranger: that's great.
You: I had some questions from our previous session, btw.
You: > You: I'm kinda a linkslut. You have any links that you adore? I will be sure to visit them.
> You: What do you like and dislike about your position? Do you get to work remote lately?
Stranger: i feel you're a bot.
Stranger: weird
You: I am not. Would you like some proof?
Stranger: go
Stranger: haha
You: We can talk about what it means for me to pass your turing test.
Stranger: ok. what do you teach
You: I am regularly called a bot, btw.
You: I teach philosophy.
You: Back in Thailand and before that in KY, I taught English.
You: (and piano)
Stranger: Ok, yeah i worked remotely because of this covid thingy
You: Do you enjoy working remotely? Some people seem to flourish with it.
Stranger: yeah, it's cheaper.
Stranger: plus i'm introvert so I don't work well with other
Stranger: less interaction
You: I hear that! =)
You: Do you have anyone in your life that you enjoy regularly interacting with?
Stranger: I'm with my parents. This is kinda the tradition here in ph. I know it's different there in us right?
Stranger: guys inside their parents house always being looked down? not sure
Stranger: i mean culture not tradition
You: I think highly of that tradition. I consider kicking one's offspring out at 18, at least at first glance, to be immoral. The world is too complex, and there's a reason that extended adolescence exists...there's too much we have to learn to participate in the world as a functioning adult.
You: I'm a hikikomori. So, I spend most of my time sitting in my basement.
You: I hope to build a life for my offspring where they would be comfortable living with us until I die, hopefully doing remote work too, if they wished.
Stranger: filipinos are very family oriented. I think most asian countries are. it can be good but sometimes it also toxic
You: Also, one type of proof: https://philosopher.life/#%40%3A%20FTO%20Proofs
Stranger: is that your site?
You: That is my site, indeed.
Stranger: i can't open your link
Stranger: oh it opened
You: It takes a while. It's ~45MB html file (much smaller compressed).
Stranger: jesus christ.
You: I agree with your assessment of Asian countries.
Stranger: are you a dev too?
You: I do not merit the title.
You: I do some things that devs do though.
Stranger: ohh ok.
Stranger: it's prety dope tho
Stranger: your site.
You: Why, thank you. And, feel free to [[Contact]] me any time (https://philosopher.life/#Contact%20h0p3).
Stranger: sure!
Stranger: i feel you're a geek
You: Most geeks consider me in another league of geek, hehe. I'm a madman.
You: Retarded, even. :P
Stranger: jesus christ
Stranger: how did you do this?
Stranger: i mean what tech stack
You: https://philosopher.life/#RGM
You: I use Tiddlywiki as the base file, but there's a sprawling and evolving infrastructure around it.
Stranger: oh, not familiar with that. I only do client's site. Stupid wordpress laravel stuff
You: It's a self-modifying HTML file, basically. It saves over itself. I use a modified node server to make it so that I can edit the file from multiple tabs (and modify from the command line to have it render in the browser).
Stranger: ohh.. how do i contact you
You: There are many properties that I like about it, including that the site can be served over a sneakernet. It allows people to search it with maximum privacy, even on an air-gapped device.
Stranger: i'm about to out
You: Tox and Session. From the link above.
You: It was a pleasure to meet you.
Stranger: what icon?
Stranger: it's 4:30pm in here.
Stranger: I can't find contact link
You: 4:30am here =)
You: https://philosopher.life/#Contact%20h0p3
You: My pubkeys for Tox and Session can be found there.
Stranger: i don't what the hell is that
Stranger: haha
Stranger: do you have an anonymous email
You: Worth your google. Promise. Secure, P2P messaging.
Stranger: i can send a message to
You: h0p3@protonmail.com
Stranger: great!
Stranger: I guess I can kill a few more minutes
You: Cool.
You: So, tell me about your family. (Everything you could want to know about me is already in that file you've got sitting in your browser).
Stranger: I'm too lazy to read. haha
Stranger: we're 6
You: Haha.
Stranger: 3 bros 2 sis
You: Where are you in birth order?
Stranger: i'm the lat
Stranger: last one
You: I have 2 younger brothers, [[JRE]] and [[AIR]].
Stranger: so you live alone now?
Stranger: is it true if you're 18 you need to get fuck out of your mom's house?
You: I live with my family, including [[AIR]]. There's [[k0sh3k]], my wife, [[1uxb0x]], my son (13), and [[j3d1h]], my daughter (15).
Stranger: in the west?
You: Sometimes it is expected of people. That norm is changing, considerably, especially with covid.
Stranger: ohh.
Stranger: your wife is an xbox
You: She has a wonderful box, and X does mark the spot. =)
Stranger: jesus christ man. i don't understand :D
You: Oh, I'm just making a joke. I'm retarded. Forgive me.
Stranger: why are you saying you're retarded? you're mentally ill?
You: It was a dirty, lewd joke. Her "box" so to speak.
Stranger: are you getting bullied?
Stranger: haha
Stranger: yeah I get the gist :D
You: Sometimes I get bullied. I do think I suffer from some mental illnesses, but I think I'm quite fortunate.
You: I say I'm retarded because I often am.
Stranger: then why call yourself retard?
Stranger: no you're just being mean to yourself
Stranger: westeners are mean haha
Stranger: is that racist?
You: I should be mean to myself to some extent. Don't worry, I also think quite highly of parts of myself to make up for it.
Stranger: omg everything is racist
You: lol
You: I think it may be culturalist.
Stranger: so what brings you to omgel
You: But, I'm not radically opposed to that.
Stranger: are you bored too?
You: To [[Find The Other]], my friend.
You: I am very rarely bored.
Stranger: what's the other
You: It's almost impossible to bore me.
You: That is not a simple question to answer. You will have to read to find out what I think. I [[recent]]ly had to examine it: https://philosopher.life/#2021.08.17%20-%20Antipleonasm%20Analysis%3A%20Loving%20The%20Other%20As%20Yourself
Stranger: nah man. I'm too lazy to read
You: [[The Other]] is not ourselves. It's something(s) or someone external to us, alien, a stranger, that which we do not know, that which we must wrestle with (kindly) to understand ourselves, them, and the world as wisely as we can.
You: I can see that, my friend.
You: It will be difficult for me to distill everything that must be said to answer your excellent question.
Stranger: then we should skip that haha
Stranger: how's your child?
Stranger: i sure hope you're not banging a pillow anime wife or some shit like that :D
You: This is also thoroughly answered in the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱. I think they are doing well. I'm worried they aren't trying hard enough in their schoolwork. Our walks have been tremendous. They've been cooking a lot for us. I respect their opinions, and I'm glad to have them in my life.
You: [[Mitch The Bitch]] is my anime pillow.
You: Just got him quite recently, very comfortable, sensuous even, as far as evil politicians go.
You: They both do some basic programming too. I bet you'd find them interesting.
Stranger: nah that's just a joke
You: They both have wikis like mine.
Stranger: yeah sure
Stranger: what language?
You: My daughter has worked in Python, C, Bash, Javascript, and some toy languages. My son Python and Bash.
You: Oh, she tried [[Rust]] as well.
Stranger: at 15?
Stranger: jesus christ
You: Since she was 6.
Stranger: you're kidding right
You: She is reasonably skilled for her age.
You: No. She completed Calculus 2 at 12.
Stranger: nah dude
You: We [[homeschool]]. I pour my life into those creatures.
Stranger: fuck math
You: Preach, yo.
Stranger: oh sorry
Stranger: :D
Stranger: why homeschool?
Stranger: you should start a cloud business with your fam :D
You: That requires an extensive answer. I will say that the schools available to them would be more like prisons than places of learning. They get to be tutored by two highly educated adults at home, and there's no substitute for it.
Stranger: lol
You: We are fortunate enough to be able to give our work away for free. I have thought about having some businesses online, but I want to work on things that capitalism will not pay for.
Stranger: i dunno about captialism tho
You: What don't you know?
Stranger: wait just google
You: I do.
You: I write about the topic at great length.
Stranger: oh so you hate for profit
You: I don't believe that was my claim.
Stranger: enlighten me
You: I am opposed to the exploitation of persons, treating them as mere means.
Stranger: oh ok
Stranger: I hate being exploited too but we have no choice here. :(
You: [[Socialism|Redpilled Socialism]] is not opposed to making a profit (and, this word may be more difficult to define than you might realize).
You: I agree that your choices are extremely limited.
You: Most [[power]] has centralized into the hands of far less than 1% of the population of the planet.
Stranger: jesus man if you only knew. fast food crew here are waged 7 bucks per day. talking about capitalism
Stranger: got only 4 mins left. i'm about to out. :D
You: I appreciate that problem. When I lived in Thailand, the wages were quite low. They survived on very little, and they did not flourish.
You: Your area of the world is highly exploited.
Stranger: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4a_QuVAP80
Stranger: that's from asian boss
Stranger: that's how filipinos get by. i was lucky
You: Yes. Thailand was quite similar.
You: And, if you can believe it, there are parts of the US like this as well.
Stranger: i think all south east asia experience the sam
You: Billions of people living with almost nothing, forced to sell their labor for next to nothing, scraping by.
Stranger: there's very few in western country. but i don't dismiss the fact that there's none.
You: I will agree that the proportion is tiny.
You: Most people in Western nations have never even glimpsed real poverty.
You: (and, for that, they are immoral)
You: I am glad that you were [[lucky]], my friend.
Stranger: yeah
Stranger: i'm about to out dude
Stranger: how can we talk again
Stranger: it was nice btw
Stranger: so i will email you then?
You: Alright, HMU sometime. If you need something, let me know. Tox and Session, or that e-mail address (however, I address people FROM my ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 when they e-mail me).
Stranger: that's h0p3@protonmail.com right?
You: That's correct.
Stranger: we figure that out sometime. email is slow tho
You: We have time, my friend.
You: This is a code word for ya: [[REDACTED]]
You: That way I know it's you.
Stranger: lol
Stranger: u have reddit?
You: I do use the site.
You: [[Reddit]] is quite a drug.
Stranger: i'll put that on subject the code
Stranger: username?
Stranger: we can chat there instead
Stranger: if you don't mind
You: I chat from Tox and Session.
You: In time, it will make more sense.
Stranger: whatevs dude. :D thanks for your time
Stranger: i'm out
You: `/wave`
Stranger has disconnected.

Peace. There's some cocksure impatience here. I adore it. <3. I must sound just as insane when I say I don't read books at this point, lol. We are after the low-hanging fruit, no doubt.

http://logs.omegle.com/deb30436a4a5a62c

You both like Psychology.
You: Hello!
Stranger: hi!
You: What brings you here today?
Stranger: boredom and feeling sick hbu
You: Oh, how are you feeling sick?
You: I'm here to [[Find The Other]], talk with folks.
You: I suppose chattin with folks can be a decent way to deal with both boredom and take your mind of feeling sick, to some extent.
Stranger: though being distracted works great
You: Tru dat. =)
You: What are some of your favorite distractions when you aren't on this website?
Stranger: crying
You: Oh shit, lol
Stranger: joking ofc
You: Some days we do have to cry it out.
Stranger: idk really, i like psychology, chatting, hanging with friends and doing new things
Stranger: art, writing, and music are cool too
You: What particular things in psychology interest you?
You: Do you have any particular pieces of [[art]] or [[music]] that you could [[link]] me to?
You: Do you write often?
Stranger: I have aspd so I love the control part and the aspects that let you into the mind of another
Stranger: so basically industrial psychology
Stranger: and you?
You: Fascinating.
You: I'm autistic. I can appreciate the interest in trying to model another's mind. It's not something that comes natural to me.
Stranger: oh? it's definitely something you'd gain from studying then. would overcome a lot
Stranger: or at least should
You: I [[hope]] so. I think it takes work to apply that knowledge, but it has opened doors for me (even into just understanding myself).
Stranger: ikrrrrr
Stranger: it's an amazing field seriously
You: I have mixed feelings about it. It's not easy to engage in science, and it relies upon folk theory and a literature that can't reproduce its results well enough (though, this seems increasingly common among sciences around the world, to my limited understanding).
You: It's a necessary field to study though, and I'm glad I do understand whatever I do.
You: I spend a lot of time talking about it with my family.
You: So, how do your friends handle your ASPD?
Stranger: sorry busy for a sec
You: Not a problem. I'm not in a rush, my friend.
Stranger: mind if we pick this up later?
Stranger: assuming yoi have socail media
You: Sure, HMU here: https://philosopher.life/#Contact%20h0p3
Stranger: thxxxx
You: It was a pleasure to meet you.
Stranger: same
Technical error: Server was unreachable for too long and your connection was lost. Sorry. :( Omegle understands if you hate it now, but Omegle still loves you.

We will see. Greyrock instincts can pay off, and barring that, being a madman who at least signals some resourcefulness makes me a poor target (at least thus far). One must be expensive to troll, even in appearance.
