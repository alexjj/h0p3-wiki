Hey! We’ve been in Texas visiting family! It was a blast. How are y’all??

Noice. =)

You all have been traveling during the pandemic.
May 28 1:47pm
Yeah, we didn’t go anywhere for the first couple months. And only to family now. Both Texas and Mississippi are open so it was all legal, lol. Everyone we went to see had been isolated so everyone was down with the probability lol. 

This is the only time Adam has had a chunk of time off so this is the first time he’s been able to visit family for more than two days at a time since college.

Jesus, I just said time a lot
May 28 1:50pm
Lol
May 28 1:51pm
That's awesome.

I like how you've turned a crisis into something positive.
May 28 1:52pm
We’re doing what we can. It does feel kind of careless to be gone so much during this, but we’ve taken care to isolate between trips the recommended time between trips and everyone we’ve gone to see is strict about isolating too. But even with us being strict about everything, there’s still that WHAT IF I’m the back of my mind.
May 28 1:54pm
Who did you get to visit in Texas?
May 28 1:58pm
Adams brother Luke! They moved there right before the pandemic started and so we finally got to see their new place.
