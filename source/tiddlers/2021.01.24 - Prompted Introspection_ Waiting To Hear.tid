title: 2021.01.24 - Prompted Introspection: Waiting To Hear

!! What are you waiting to hear from someone close to you?

I'm waiting to hear back from [[Sphygmus]] about how she's approaching it (I'm not anticipating a change), considering how pieces fit together (they probably can't), and thinking about what I need to do. Perhaps I've significantly misunderstood, but I'm not optimistic in the short-term here.<<ref "i">> Maybe I'm waiting on her to more explicitly put me out of my misery?<<ref "m">> Perhaps direct [[contact]] will simply vanish, and I want to make sure I've [[ltf]] to bootstrapping us back together should it appear again. 

The [[pause]] has been instructive for me. I have prepared for living quietly like this in the ocean of words for a long time, [[WINTCIS]].<<ref "t">> The vulnerability is still there; it's not gnostic, it's fair (anyone paying attention should know of this route), but the obscurity of mild steganography is probably going to work in most cases.  

I have no idea how long I might need to wait. [[k0sh3k]] thinks I should shoot for less than my gut here.
