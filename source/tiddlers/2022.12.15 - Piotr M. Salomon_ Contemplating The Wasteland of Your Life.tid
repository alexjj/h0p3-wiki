It is always my honor to meet a philosopher in the desert. This is a profoundly ugly and reductive opening gambit, too. Unfortunately, I think it's the only fitting one available to us.<<ref "ty">> We're gonna have to make it personal. `/bow`.

Most people who would run across you and your words would abandon you, and, in this case, I sympathize with their instincts. I completed the handshake of our conversation knowing what would be required; it's part of my vocation to work with evil people and lost causes, [[WINTCIS]]. So, I'm doing my best to tend your wounds and point you in the right direction, though I do not predict my effort will be fruitful for you.<<ref "id">> Picking and setting bones can be painful. This may hurt. I remain with you. 

You will note that I have taken the time to [[wrestle]] with your feature-rich antisocial<<ref "as">> testimony.<<ref "yw">> It is a horrifying picture. I've done my best to understand your perspective (including, for example, your [[climate change|https://www.reddit.com/r/Polska/comments/bo7wwv/poziom_co2_w_atmosferze_osi%C4%85gn%C4%85%C5%82_rekordowo_wysok%C4%85/enjyrgo/]] [[hysteria skepticism|https://www.reddit.com/r/zizek/comments/bjgmqp/slavoj_zizek_on_kids_who_protest_climate_change/em8gp9s/]] psyops) given such a short timeframe.

I recognize you haven't [[escaped it|https://www.reddit.com/r/awakened/comments/3r5tw9/you_think_you_are_wasting_your_life/]].<<ref "il">> Your past decade is clear evidence of that.

I've seen the [[bankrupt|https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/cduvdx/moralizing_ai_can_we_make_machines_that_reason/ety8s88/]] [[script|https://www.reddit.com/r/Polska/comments/baf44m/broniarz_przegrywamy_z_rogacizn%C4%85_i_trzod%C4%85_chlewn%C4%85/ekgipur/]] you are following and [[repeating ad nauseam|https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/cdj4mw/an_ai_of_human_intelligence_or_above_would/ety5dce/]] plenty. And, though I know it's painful to hear it (as you accuse others of lacking authenticity over and over again like a cookie-cutter N-word-ean), I'm betting dollars to doughnuts there are quiet moments in your life when you know your position is hollow and worse than meaningless as well.<<ref "nb">>

Beyond the opportunity to actually understand reality (to whatever [[dok]] we can or ought), one crucial reason not to be a nihilist is that you'll have a [[chance]] of successfully [[ recognizing|https://www.reddit.com/r/zizek/comments/d19lc4/slavoj_zizek_the_amazon_is_burning_and_your_tiny/ezl2au6/]] and [[respect]]ing the objective dignity of persons (including your own) and acting accordingly. In short, you can't be a good person as a nihilist, and that's why you should find and live for what really matters. If [[you don't see the purpose|https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/cdj4mw/an_ai_of_human_intelligence_or_above_would/etv9jjv/]] in being kind, then you may tend not to.<<ref "tn">> You do seem comfortable in the dark, becoming one with the abyss, [[narcissistically believing nothing is really true or ultimately matters|https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/m7n3zz/well_never_have_true_ai_without_first/grginb7/]].<<ref "en">> Of course, I [[hope]] you are making moral progress in [[dissociating|https://www.reddit.com/r/sorceryofthespectacle/comments/bqjmmf/how_to_dissociate_yourself_from_the_spectacle/eo7lchd/]] from your self-described [[dark triadic tendencies|https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/355pl3/the_dark_side_of_ace_manipulating_and_hurting/]]. 

[[You|https://www.reddit.com/r/nihilism/comments/4ft608/nonexistence_of_self_is_a_narcissistic_mask_not/]] still don't seem to know what [[love]] means (and not just from what appears to be a lack of experience<<ref "lv">>) nor even a fitting orientation for [[your place|https://www.reddit.com/r/nihilism/comments/4enxb8/on_why_undermen_always_think_they_are_the_supermen/]] in reality.

> It's neutral/positive fact of language.

However [[ironic|https://www.reddit.com/r/nihilism/comments/5fdsbt/the_blind_spot_of_irony/]] the phrase may be, the [[essential|https://www.reddit.com/r/artificial/comments/cdj4mw/an_ai_of_human_intelligence_or_above_would/eucw7y1/]] tenets of nihilism are neither deducible from language nor obtain as facts in themselves. As you know, under epistemic closure, it inevitably deconstructs itself, and in a degenerative manner at that. [[Phenomenologically]], it's perhaps something like the act of importing an {[[axiom]]} that all there is solipsistically boils down to importing [[axioms|https://www.reddit.com/r/nihilism/comments/8u27ah/how_nihilism_originates_in_dogmatism_for_the/]]. How convenient for you! That's part of the reason you're stuck (or use it as a cover for your egoism). As part of your radical abuse of the word "truth," you really want to think meaning is just a language game in a material world. It's sad to see your intelligence wasted in such a malignant tarpit. It's been interesting to see you develop your continental vocabulary over the years, expediently picking from the postmodern buffet, but it's obvious you've not studied the right languages (a damned shame given your intelligence and sensitivity too). 

I'll give you this though: it's admirable you do not turn to faux spirituality, but instead [[aim]] to be somewhat instrumentally logical about the matter. You don't avoid existentialism<<ref "ext">> like others might in your shoes, and I admire your ferocity. Thankfully, you don't take your nihilism too seriously, as though enlightenment‚Ñ¢ were realized via negativa, understanding the emptiness of all [[games]] such that you stop playing for money, status, relationships, herd morality, purpose, and eventually "enlightenment" itself (lmao).<<ref "enl">> Obviously, I disagree with the games you choose to play: not all are equal. Getting back to metaphysics and the objectivity of morality, what you desperately wish to reject (even perhaps going so far as to conflate it with social constructs), is an [[expensive process|Positive Disintegration]].

> Technocracy is not nihilistic, because to realize nihilism one has to perform intellectual operations. Technocrats are naturalists subordinate to the same rudimentary mechanics as bio-chemistry, echoing natural stupidity and obedience to external conditions, as well as maintained by simple loops of satisfaction. 

> It is those same technocrats that coined the idea of nature being disorderly and free in a negative sense, in a classic neurotic disavowal to create positive meaning to their idiotic classifications, their eternal obedience. But in fact both nature and technocracy are of the same strict order, inertia of life gravitating towards repetition.

Why do you think this is what I was talking about? That isn't what inspired me to ask you a single question. I'll bite though. 

I did not claim technocracy was nihilistic, though it can be created and maintained by those who are nihilists. Note that one can be subject to technocracy or participate in one while performing intellectual operations, including the misguided assumptions and inferences of nihilism. Further, we can entertain the idea that one can be either a nihilist or nihilistic without realizing it, and just in case it need be said: arriving at nihilism is hardly a noble or serious intellectual feat in itself (many technocratic inferences are wildly more complex and difficult to achieve from a computational perspective). Technocrats need not be naturalists, and I wonder if [[you are|https://www.reddit.com/r/Brain/comments/bwcwyq/when_you_think_is_it_happening_in_light_speed/epyv5jd/]] [[projecting|https://www.reddit.com/r/Polska/comments/bd0ubj/deleted_by_user/ekvie2w/]] [[here|https://www.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/bnu0af/climate_change_and_altering_life_plans/en9e0pp/]]. 

To be clear, you think [[capitalism|https://www.reddit.com/r/zizek/comments/bne1i2/whats_zizek_position_on_morality_of_age_of/en5l60l/]] is nihilistic, and given [[your own logic|https://www.reddit.com/r/sorceryofthespectacle/comments/c33yx8/the_goal_and_purpose_of_western_civilization_is/erq0hgb/]], it seems plausible to apply it to technocracy as well. There's an irony to a nihilist who resents his own oppression in a nihilistic system, desperate to find a way to maintain his own nihilism (which is really just a shield for egoism) while decrying it in others. And, I realize, as a nihilist, you don't really care if you've represented reality with salient accuracy here; it doesn't really mean anything to you beyond [[what you want it to mean|https://www.reddit.com/r/Polska/comments/d3q6zn/czy_jest_jakikolwiek_pow%C3%B3d_by_%C5%BCy%C4%87/f093ekr/]], right? `/sigh`. 

It remains far from obvious that you are much better than these technocrats. You pick out the hedonic treadmill well enough,<<ref "re">> and you hate watching others live as though they are merely pushing particles on the surface of this rock (though you seem to take pleasure in telling people that's all they are to you). You also know we are autonomous and that we should have contempt for misusing it (but, that's the problem: you are misusing your freedom). May you choose to pursue what's objectively more valuable than worshipping the apparent nothingness inside yourself as well.<<ref "ti">> 

I admire many of your critiques of the centralization of political power, and you pick out many immoralities in the world (even though you claim there is no such thing as immorality). I wish [[others]] could see even half as clearly as you do. Unfortunately, your nihilism prevents you from having any serious foundation for [[pleft]]ism. You've not any universal reasons to point toward, and hence no reason to differentiate your subjectivity from any other. At best, you can make predictions, like Saint Marx, and at worst, you're as worse-than-useless as Stirner. In many ways, you are better than the covert narcissists who [[private]]ly pursue their own pleasure and self-absorbed fantasy worlds in apathy, indifference, and ultimately, a chosen lack of empathy even more dangerous than your own; you publicly face the music more than most in your shoes. Keep going, sir. You can do it.

> If anything, I'd like to escape nature, and the fact this existence does not allow me to is my eternal source of anguish. Nature is a prison, and all naturalists are learned in prison logic, prison values and virtues, prison rules, leashed by their stupid pointless survival.

This is perhaps the most honest thing you've said in the thread.<<ref "tno">> It sounds like your will to [[power]] is to extend your essence beyond everything, that you wish to be [[The Absolute]] [[Itself]]. Do you desire to be something like [[God|https://www.reddit.com/r/sorceryofthespectacle/comments/bku8zr/discussion_topic_3_god_as_a_tangible_knowable/emk8rqw/]]? Is the fact that you aren't the greatest conceivable object in the universe an affront to your [[ego|https://www.reddit.com/r/Polska/comments/bdt54p/%C5%BC%C3%B3%C5%82wiak_szanghajski_zagro%C5%BCony_zmar%C5%82a_ostatnia/el18xfv/]]?<<ref "sh">> You sound like [[Agent Smith|The Matrix]].<<ref "nt">> Indeed, it becomes ever clearer what it is that you need to escape from: your self. 

You don't want to be bound by any laws, especially [[The Moral Law]]. So, you choose your philosophical position because you don't want to face pain?<<ref "lmao">> Yeah, I can see why you don't want to face the truth, going so far as to denying such a thing is real altogether. You know there's more to life than surviving, but you've chosen delusions and masturbation to fill in the void. I can see why you still feel like it's pointless.

Meaning isn't internal: it's external to you! Finding what's worth binding yourself to is the hard part, and I know you've been burned badly here. `/nod`. I run across so many ex-Christians, though few as clever as you. It takes courage to escape nihilism. You can do it. May you discover what your freedom is really [[FTSO]], [[nomad]].

> Isn't it sad that in absence of your own name you have to use mine in effort to make an impression? 

Though I am quiet about it, my names have not been absent. You simply weren't listening and looking for them.<<ref "lp">> The trail to my identity has sat before you the entire time. I'll agree that I put effort into understanding your identity and writing a one-liner that would catch your attention. I hoped to offer you the chance to agree up front, as well. 

I used your apparent [[legal name|Piotr M. Salomon]] because you clearly adore it and perhaps even need people to know it.<<ref "rm">> More importantly, it was fitting given your uncharitable diatribe toward RNGreed. I'd like to see you attempt to steelman reasons for [[anonymity]]/pseudonymity, which I can't seem to find anywhere on your account (despite your violence and obvious hypocrisy).<<ref "op">>

I'll agree speaking with you is sad. I don't have a problem with how I've approached you, but I do find the circumstances which brought about my speaking to you sad. I suppose I could make other kinds of impressions on you, but this has done the trick just fine. I've opened the door, Piotr, in case you want to listen (and to let you know you've been heard). I had hoped you might have something more polite, coherent, and accurate to say to both myself and your original interlocutor.<<ref "n">>

Allow me to jog your prodigious memory on [[how names|Naming and Necessity]] might work. Different individual constants may pick out the same object in a domain of discourse, and they may have particularized meanings despite [[sharing]] the same referent (each reference being its own category of contexts). 4eak is an old name of mine, but it still checks out. Roughly, it still picks me out, and in a particular way that has its own meaning. There are many names that pick me out. The same is true of you, hockiklocki.<<ref "a">> It's true that there are other 4eaks and hockiklockis on the net, but the same is true of our offline names as well (I checked, in your case). So far, it seems like your legal name is somewhat arbitrary (but, hey, you're a nihilist, right?). And, as is tradition on this ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±, I ask you: what do you think your name means?

You spend a lot of time telling people who you think they are, a dangerous task. I'm obligated to do so for you in this case. In a sense, our stories are our names, and that's what I'm addressing in this [[letter]] to you. I'm thinking about how you've named yourself, intentionally and unintentionally. Obviously, it's a mixed bag, homie. `/nod`.

> Among others one thing which differs animals form humans is that they don't know the value of names.

I am fortunate to have the opportunity to speak with people who are interested in this distinction. No doubt, I take [[name]]s seriously. Your statement isn't as accurate as you intended. First, humans are animals. Second, not all humans are persons, and that's what you're really trying to differentiate. Third, there may be other animals who use names effectively enough to meet the conditions of personhood, language users, full-fledged Dasein, and so on, and so forth. Lastly, and sad-ironically, through your nihilism and psychopathy, you have failed to recognize and search for the meanings of names and their bearers. It is you who have turned your back on the objective value and meaning of names and language more generally, sir. You seem to temporarily pick it up only when it suits you.

> Piotr M. Salomon

A cursory search doesn't demonstrate you use your offline name on most of your presumed accounts.<<ref "at">> You appear to use many pseudonyms. That's a pity, Piotr. I'm looking forward to a [[Public Self-Model]] beyond your plebbit account to go along with that noble name of yours. As far as keyboard warriors go, I think you've a ways to go before a rational person would call you courageous or high-integrity. At the very least, thank you for offering up yourself to be made an example of. If you ever want to speak in [[good]] [[faith]] with me, please do. I think we could [[share]] a great deal together.

With skin in the non-mere game, I am here to love my enemy, sir. Regardless of whether you communicate any further with me, time is of the essence. You have the [[chance]] to choose to be a [[good]] person. The world would be [[lucky]] if you did.

[[Love]],<<ref "l">>
