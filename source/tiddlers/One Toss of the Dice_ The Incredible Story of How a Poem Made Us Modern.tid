title: One Toss of the Dice: The Incredible Story of How a Poem Made Us Modern

!! [[ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱]]

<<<
Space in “One Toss of the Dice” has the function of punctuation, a have-stop function. It distracts and destabilizes, disrupts the normal expectation that the order of appearance of syntactical units will correspond to the logical sequence of meaning, and that meaning will coincide with the world. The empty spaces leave hanging elements of language that cannot stand alone, e.g., “than playing” (que de jouer), “no matter where” (n’importe où), “or the event” (ou se fût l’évènement), “not so much” (pas tant). Space dissolves what the printed elements of the poem unite. The spaces encourage us to pause, to seek another method of reading, other paths to follow, such great unexpected reversals, surprises, ellipses, and setbacks all being part of verbal modernism, and of the hypertext of the information age in which we now live.

At the furthest reach of its effective horizon, Mallarmé’s poem is an early avatar of the hypertext of our era, with its modular possibilities of reading up and down, backward, forward, and obliquely, with great leaps. In its juddering jumps from one place of meaning to another, “One Toss of the Dice” is the zero point of a change of mental universe that culminated in the World Wide Web.

The poet expressed the blurred boundary between continuous space and linear time via the medium of verse whose scattered words were meant to be read one after the other, yet taken in all at once—an approximation of the simultaneity that Einstein articulated via imaginary thought problems and mathematical equations.

At its furthest reach, Mallarmé’s practice of interactive reading, as expressed in “One Toss of the Dice,” and his vision of an infinitely connected universe, as expressed in the idea of The Book, have materialized in the hypertext of contemporary media, and in the global, public computer network system, the World Wide Web.

“One Toss of the Dice” is a seafaring poem, and “cybernetics” is a nautically derived term: its roots, in the Greek word “kubernetes,” hark back to the third-century philosopher Plotinus, who used it to refer to the “steersman” of a boat. Almost all the characteristics of our cybernetic world are as if preordained in the terms that Mallarmé used to describe this “total word” and “Poem of Humanity”; this “terrifying and harmonious plenitude”; this “immaculate grouping of universal relationships come together for some miraculous and glittering occasion”; this “latent conducting wire” that “would explain all earthly existence”; this Universal Library whose fluid pages exceed the bindings of any traditional book; and this alchemical source of limitless wealth that would transform the nature of the human community. In turn, the ambitions of those who made computers, their software, and the Internet elide surprisingly with those of France’s “Prince of Poets.”

Early contributors to the development of the Internet emphasize the associational logic that we have seen to be an integral part of “One Toss of the Dice.” In a landmark article published in The Atlantic Monthly of July 1945, Vannaver Bush, an engineer and inventor in charge of the U.S. Office of Scientific Research and Development during World War II, spoke of “wholly new forms of encyclopedias . . . , ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them.” Information technology pioneer Ted Nelson, the son of Hollywood director Ralph Nelson and actress Celeste Holm, wrote in 1965 of “literary machines,” computers that would enable people to write and publish in a new, nonlinear format, hypertext, which, when combined with graphics, video, and audio, constituted a new way of imagining knowledge: hypermedia. For Nelson, “hypermedia” meant “nonsequential” text, “in which a reader was not constrained to read in any particular order, but could follow links and delve into the original document from a short quotation.” The English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee, working at the European Organization for Nuclear Research in the late 1980s, developed HTML, a universal language by which various computer software programs might communicate with one another. He emphasized the decentered nature of hypertext in the earliest version of the Web, Enquire, which allows us to break out of ordinary linear modes of thought and to “make intuitive leaps across the boundaries—those coveted random associations.”32

Mallarmé’s integral vision of The Book is echoed in the totalizing push of the World Wide Web. Vannaver Bush asked us to imagine a “future device for individual use, which is a sort of mechanized private file and library.” He suggested we call this device a “Memex,” “in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications.” Tim Berners-Lee imagined that the universal HTML language might connect “all the bits of information . . . on the planet” into “a single, global information space.”33

Cybernetic information sharing and storage, in the wake of Mallarmé’s original poetic articulation, have revived the ancient dream of assembling boundless, unified fields of knowledge in a single volume. The poet’s Grand Oeuvre may, in fact, be most fully realized in the electronic encyclopedia, available worldwide in a plethora of languages, Wikipedia, and in Google’s attempt, announced around the beginning of the twenty-first century, to organize the world’s books by scanning the holdings of five American research libraries. A Chinese company, Superstar, reported that, as of 2006, it had digitized 1 million books in Chinese, or half the titles published since 1949. With whole libraries accessible online, we imagine that whatever we wish to know or to have or to do is somehow to be found or obtained or done via the World Wide Web, a virtual mirror of the universe that carries to completion Mallarmé’s vast project of writing on everything by assembling writing about everything.

The Internet has brought to fruition the poet’s ambition to compose a work that would “change the nature of the human community,” whose isolated parts are now connected worldwide. Mallarmé, writing in the 1880s and 1890s, imagined his project of The Book along the lines of a peculiar theatrical performance, one in which those in attendance would read a series of folios alongside the “operator,” the “simple reader,” or the “first reader.” The poet provided for a participatory community of readers that anticipated the new communities of readers on the Web. Whether in a bar in Brazil, an office in Bangalore, a basement in Beijing, an attic in Brooklyn, a beach on the Riviera, or a bistro in Beirut, internauts are potentially in contact with one another. As long as someone has an online device, he or she can read, author, correct, comment, and contest information on the World Wide Web. Today’s global websites are forums in which participants exhibit still photographs and video; make restaurant and travel reservations; read dining, hotel, theater, and shopping reviews; play interactive games; meet online, and mingle via social media; rent apartments and houses; and buy and sell real estate as well as all manner of consumer goods and services.

Mallarmé, who suffered from a lack of money his whole life, may have seen The Book, alongside The Latest Fashion, as a get-rich scheme. Ready to burn “the furniture and the rafters of the roof, to feed the furnace of the Grand Oeuvre,” he described its potential for generating wealth in alchemical terms. When it came to an actual business plan, however, his ideas focused on the conventional means of selling a large quantity of books, whose blank spaces, like those in “One Toss of the Dice,” would be loaded with advertising inserts. The poet, who wrote an advice column for women and endorsed some of the most exclusive luxury merchandise of fin-de-siècle France, could not have imagined the potential of the Internet for generating exponential sums via the sale of advertising, commissions on transactions over commercial websites, or the explosive increase in the market value of stocks in companies that in some cases have yet to turn a profit. Both the Web and the poet’s unrealized project of The Book hold the potential for mysterious, wanton wealth, whose source and limits are unclear.

Mallarmé’s master poem indisputably and unapologetically set the agenda for artistic modernity, for the associative logic of the modern novel and poetry, the flattened perspective of modern painting, the atonal harmonies and syncopated rhythms of modern music. The poet’s masterwork was the first of a series of great breaks with traditional notions of time and space, which, along with an emphasis upon the quanta of matter, are the stuff of modern physics. The enchantment of the world that Mallarmé envisaged via poetry prefigured astonishingly the World Wide Web, whose speed, vastness, and endless possibilities of connection bring the times in which we live closer than any in the past to that great Platonic harmony, of which “One Toss of the Dice” is an early beacon and a guiding light.

!! Modernity

<<<
Insofar as Mallarmé considered himself to be “a capacity of the spiritual Universe,” he took himself to represent all of humanity...Modernity, as it took shape in the second half of the nineteenth century and the first quarter of the twentieth, was synonymous with rupture, melancholy, skepticism, anxiety, self-criticism, spiritual failure, nihilism, and despair, alongside the perceived loss of individual autonomy as well as the failure of science and technology and of liberal democratic institutions.

<<<
Mallarmé may have thought himself a vessel of the crisis of faith as it worked itself out between the Enlightenment and the end of the nineteenth century...he had caught a glimpse of the great universal undefined infinite, which he would henceforth characterize as his “dream” or “ideal,” and which gave direction and meaning to the rest of his life.
