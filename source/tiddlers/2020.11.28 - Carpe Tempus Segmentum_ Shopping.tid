title: 2020.11.28 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Shopping

* Chips, dip, coffee
* Read+Write+//GoT//
* Someone has damaged my laptop charger (or maybe worse).
** I'm so used to sitting on [[m16]] to write. It's not so common for me to be on a laptop on the couch, but that has ramped up this past week. I've not taken too much seriously this week. It's been nice. 
* Sleep by 8?
* Woke at 2?
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Had my offspring articulate their tasks outloud. Surely, they will understand the value of their words.
* //Skintime//
* Assisted Fireman Time!
* I was given a book to read. There are hot women in it. It's going to have an amazing plot. I know it.
* [[JRE]] Called
** Old racecar driver video & cheating
** Flat-earthers and epistemology
** Moving plans
** xylophone
** Doesn't want to lose Quinn
** Wage-slavery definitions, power decentralization focus
** Got to video chat with Matthew, and saw Quinn (fuckin huge for 10 weeks old)
* Shopping at Costco
** Felt like fewer people than usual.
** Rumbled along in our beater. When it dies (any day now), we should get another one. I like having the space.
** We got a ton of noodles and rice. We stocked up. 
** Hotdog date. =)
*** My wife told me a terrible story about a group home she worked at. A church demanded they travel down to Atlanta to open presents in front of them. The kids had to be coached on attitudes in order to not endanger funding. My wife said the truth about the matter, and it got her in trouble. 
** Also, Star Experiment is over. She did notice it (I struck out there), and she thought I might actually be measuring something (I struck out there), but she didn't give a fuck (nailed it there).
* More discussions of my offspring's requirements as members of the household. 
* //GoT// + Chips + Salsa + Coffee
* Many hugs
