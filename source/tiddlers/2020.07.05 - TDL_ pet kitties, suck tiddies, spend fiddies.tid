* I'd like to see you take a tolerance break and clear your lenses.
** It's not as important as it once was to you; you are convinced. Still, [[Question Everything]] is exceptionally fair here. Let's at least ease off to some extent.
** Can you do it without drinking? Will you?
* A simple camp would be dope.
* [[k0sh3k]] wants to hit the major W-Entity we missed. 
** Might as well pick up missing camp supplies (god fucking damn you Samwise Gamgee, I guess getting me some rope and tarp would be reasonable), some kind of dinner on the fly, and spices.
* If you can, sleep out there. 
** Might not be ready, and maybe nobody will want to. Enjoy playing Minecraft otherwise.
* Clearly, you need sex. All of it. Every last drop. =)
