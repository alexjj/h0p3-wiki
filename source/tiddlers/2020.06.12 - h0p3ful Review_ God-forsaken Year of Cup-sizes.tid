** `/standing-ovation`, Bravo!
*[[The Lightning Thief: 13 & 14, Final draft]]
** Make sure you make all corrections your mother picks out. There will be many things to learn, and you have a long way to go still. You are doing excellent work.
*[[2020.06.11 – Wiki Review: That'd suck]]
** You should hunt for "git" puns. Given the number of sickos who work with that toolset, I am sure there are loads to be found.
*** Puns are a natural ally of the autist in some cases. I think your mother wields them well in lots of social situations. I hope you continue to practice and enjoy them. It's an art well beyond me.
** Well, thank you again. I will do my best to live up to it.
** So many books to read. I am excited for you.
*[[2020.06.11 – TDL: Science!]]
** Please use your grammar tooling.
** Let's keep trying to pump it up.

** "God-forsaken year," lol. Especially 2020, right?
*** Though, it seems like you've had an upward trajectory year over year.
*** Terrible for the world, and insofar as that matters to you, then terrible to you in some sense. I appreciate that. If you lived in a vacuum of sorts (or a bubble ;P), we'd have ample reason to think that it's been pretty sweet this year, yeah?
** The end of the year is a giant firecracker. Candy is dope.

** Sparse. I am grateful to see you writing about your book.
** To be clear, you have not failed completely. You are not being fair to my own judgment in this case. You are regularly praised in our [[Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση]] presentations.
*[[2020.06.11 – Antipleonasm Analysis: Maybe.]]
** That is an interesting tangent to go on. It's not obviously on topic, but I somehow don't care. The point you bring up is valuable to weigh. 
*** It will be important, however, that you are able to stay on topic and respond to the object springing forth in the burning bush as we all tell the story of it. Make a clear path to tell the primary story, but don't forget to develop those branches like this.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** [[Print Reading]] seems like a place to grow when you get the time.
** I wonder how AJ, Alex, Jacob, and Isaac are doing, [[2017.06.12 -- Blessings Log]]. I bet it has been a wild ride for them being homeschooled for a few months.
*** I hope they have a good life too. People come and go in our lives. We're lucky to have them sit by our campfires while they can. We are all traveling nomads.
** You've become significantly more adept at telling the story of your life.
