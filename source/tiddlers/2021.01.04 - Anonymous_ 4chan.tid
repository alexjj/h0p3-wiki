How do I navigate this exactly? What is the site for? Weird indeed, friendo.
<<<

There's a "[[Read Me|Readme]]" but it didn't help much. Maybe too much to navigate. The source is huge.

...

it looks like the author speaks directly from the site sometimes too

<<<
there's chatlog under bkmrx button on the right that might have something interesting. this looks fun.
<<<

[[FTO]] is a place that I need to figure out how to improve upon. I'm heading back to the drawing board to try again.

<<<
It reads like a pseud rationalist got addicted to Adderall lol. Anything potentially interesting is going to be buried under layers of hypertext navigation and overly verbose nonsense.
<<<

That appears to be a fair assessment. I am a [[madman]] in the desert.

<<<
It's someone's personal blogwiki.
<<<

That's true. I also speak from and through it in [[hyperconversation]]s. `/wave`

<<<
Most of the weirdness is affected. It's an attempt to embody a certain "philosopheur" aesthetic. Or alternatively, someone's private language. But given that this is posted online for everyone to see, probably the former.
<<<

XD. That doesn't sound cynical at all. =) I can appreciate that (I speak of it a great deal), and I imagine I would likely draw similar conclusions in your shoes. 

<<<
I hate when people try to do this larpy “schizo” philosophical aesthetic. It’s not impressive.

“OOOH I CAN STRING TECHNICAL TERMS AND JARGON! I’M GOING INSANEEEE AHHHH”

It’s not that jargon or technical terms are a problem but you can just tell they’re stringing them specifically because they like the schizo-techno-Phile aesthetic
<<<

I would like to see more examples of what you're pointing out. I'm hard-pressed to find many [[ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱]]s like mine. It does have some LARPyness to it, but I think close inspection might demonstrate it's not a mere [[game]] or RPed story. [[Aesthetic]] is insufficient, I agree, and I also agree that that my life and life's work are not impressive enough. To whom much is given, much is required.

It's fair to say I'm going insane, and I do string together a bunch of annoying words. What do you think the text ought to be? 

<<<
I love that stuff like this exists
<<<

Me too. It's been expensive to read+write. I am [[grateful]] that some folks find it at least amusing and interesting. I [[hope]] we can build more than that together too.

<<<
Nah, you need to be a little cringy to push art forward
<<<

I am interested in making [[Art]], but only insofar as it is toward [[The Telos]]. That's what I think [[Art]] is [[FTSO]] though. I agree that it is cringy to such an extreme [[dok]]. Earnestness is cringy in a postmodern world.

I appreciate your defense.

<<<
No fun allowed
<<<

Lol. Thank you for defending my work. I find this comment funny because I am often the "no fun allowed" asshole in many contexts. So cereal, [[I know|Know Thyself]].

<<<
    i read entries on here, this is a honest and sometimes moving account of a persons life.
<<<

Thank you. That means a lot to me. I appreciate that you would take the time to empathize. I know it is an expensive pile to rummage through.

<<<
Is it really pushing art forward when nick land’s been doing it for longer than many posters here have been alive? 
<<<

Well, I cannot say I'm all that original. I think some of my best work is merely a [[footnote|Footnotes]] to and reiteration of [[Saint Plato]]. If you are a fan of Nick Land, you might really dislike my work.

<<<
But it’s not even particularly unique or fun, how many lain-esque sites like this exist and how many word string schizophrenia posters have you seen online? Maybe I’ve just been more exposed to it but it just seems like such a larp. If they were doing it in a genuinely artistic way I guess I would find it better, but it just feels so visibly like an act. I don’t fall for the illusion.
<<<

I am a huge fan of [[Serial Experiments Lain|TV: Library]], if that's what you mean. Do you have a list I could look at? I am okay if it is not unique or fun (though your claim seems debatable).

Note that "string schizophrenia posters" aren't conceptually incorrect communicators, nor do they necessarily have invalid perspectives in all contexts, nor can we rule out the rhetorical presentation with any certainty. Maybe some charity is owed, yeah? Part of what it means to engage in empiricism will likely imply making mistakes in our top-down modeling, including the delusions or hallucinations of schizophrenia in what we perceive. 

There are some who consider it mere performance. I would [[challenge|Wiki Litmus Test]] you to actually speak with me for a while. [[Question Everything]], of course. I am a person who takes skepticism seriously. What do you think makes for an authentic representation of a thing-in-itself? Is it simply too deceptive for your taste? I say the truth as best I know how up front; usually, it takes a while before people realize I'm serious.

<<<
the funny thing is you are obsessed with the attitude you critisize. It's not "genuinely artistic" to you because it tries to be genuinely artistic to you. You are essentially wanting them to try harder
<<<

I'm not sure I can try harder (I already pour so much effort into it), but I could do a better job (though we might speak of "doing better" in terms of trying harder). Whether or not it is genuine art (whatever that means) is less relevant to me than whether or not it fulfills its primary purposes. 

<<<
Yes, I want them to genuinely put in effort to make the artifice beautiful and decadent while keeping it convincing and elegantly smooth. That’s the juggling point that I personally like.
<<<

Some find it [[beautiful]] and decadent, and most don't. I admit that [[The Golden Rule]] requires me to some [[dok]] to make something you find aesthetically pleasing too, though I think that is not a signficant enough factor in what is most [[salient]] in this practice. 

I am curious about what you mean by "unconvincing." You have a very strong reaction to it to not be convinced of something. I'm not a fan of mere rhetoric; too often it is unjustified [[Memetic Warfare]]. You may find it more convincing if you engage it more directly and long-term. I know that what is right is not sexy often enough.

<<<
I like the design, but could use less brainlet level big name philosopher namedroping, a bit too much unnuanced ethos for my liking (not against ethos, but do it a little better)
<<<

I agree that my intelligence and knowledge are quite limited. Most of the writing never even mentions big name philosophers. I'll agree that most people find me dogmatic and unnuanced eventually. I [[hope]] to do it better, ofc.

<<<
can you give an example of something moving. the writing style is a bit much for me but he seems like an intelligent person and I like the retro edgy-hacker aesthetic
<<<

I like it too. I'm sitting here in front of my screen enjoying the view as I write, [[ITS]]. The writing style is atrocious. I wish it were more legible. I have to strike a balance, and I don't know how how to do that well enough. I'm not a [[good]] writer in so many crucial ways too, I know. 

To be clear: I do not wish to merely move people. [[gfwiwcgws]]. [[FTSO]]. Toward what [[end]]? I [[aim]] to never treat my interlocutors as mere means.

Tell me more about yourself, and I might be able to locate something "moving" to you, but I think it is better to engage the ergodic text yourself, digging for [[gem]]s the old-fashioned way.

<<<
    Self-improoving, but without Peterson. Fake and gay
<<<

XD. Peterson and I have some profound disagreements. I appreciate not being like him in many respects (although, I sadly find myself agreeing with many sections of his arguments). There are significant self-improvement aspects to this [[ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱]], but, depending on how you wish to define "self-improvement," you may find a kaleidoscope of work in here.

<<<
on the other hand we are all going insane so the tone is somewhat justified
<<<

<<<
This whole category of "cringe" is actually very puerile.
<<<

I pride myself on my childish [[humor]]. It's an important part of my life. It would be a mistake to lose it, though I agree it doesn't belong everywhere.

<<<
is this your blog? some interesting phrases but overall looks like the retarded after-thoughts of someone who took a little too much LSD
<<<

It is at least a blog of a retard's after-thoughts. I highly recommend using LSD at least once in your lifetime. It changed my life considerably. Do you use any substances yourself?

<<<
This is a respectable LARP
<<<

I am glad that you find it respectable. I am not convinced it is a LARP (I need some definitions, particularly those that don't devolve into picking out everything as a LARP [which I'm afraid some definitions might]), though there is some RPing in here (e.g. [[???]]). I don't consider this medium a prop, though it is often a [[gem]], a lantern, a boat, and more to me. It is a communications device, no doubt. It's a real human talking with you, albeit behind the proverbial 7 proxies and contained in an ugly black box, I realize.

I do speak with interlocutors who are presumably primarily constructions of my mind ([[Aispondence]] and [[Prompted Introspection]] are some solid examples), but I'm lucky to develop real relationships with this tool too. This wiki is a dialectical extension of my identity over the wire, and so are your communications an extension of you. There will always be an uncovering, but I know this is real even if I don't know what it is well enough.

<<<
What exactly is "forward"?
<<<

<<<
    I don't understand why someone who is so focused on the greater "good" and self-improvement would sink so much time into something that just serves to fuel your own ego
<<<

It serves plenty of intermediate purposes. I suggest you've not gotten to know me or the text well enough to have warrant for your claim just yet. I can appreciate why you are worried this "just" serves to fuel my ego; I'm fairly worried about the egoistic Rand-Locke memeplex infection of almost everyone, including myself. I am trying to demonstrate what it means for egos to collectively find [[Justice]] together, to give a theory and a [[PSM]]ed practice, [[WINTCIS]]. My open accountability is part of what keeps my ego in check.<<ref "t">> Even my voice in this [[hyperconversation]] is hedged-conservative. I'm saying my limited 2 cents on the forum and giving you the ability to know more if you want (on a medium we can both privately own to a significant degree); I'm not polluting the commons, and I make myself quite vulnerable (consider how little skin-in-the-game you have here by comparison). I've tried to make it fair discourse. Admittedly, it may be the case that it takes some ego to stand up to the text, `/nudge`, :P. [[We can|Find The Others]] [[wrestle]] {[[About]]} [[It]] [[if you'd|Anonymous]] [[like]].

<<<
Is this link safe or is this some glowie shit?
<<<

You are not the first person to essentially ask this question. You are free to download the entire site and examine it on an airgapped machine. I have no idea how to make it safer without a loss in functionality.

You have [[Root]] read access. [[Root Users]] may have read+write access. I will agree that I am too quick to add [[Root Users]], and I will also agree that giving people the entire [[ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱]] is beyond awful opsec. I am aware of many of the immense [[privacy]] losses/costs I incur.

    Very sweet words written about his family. If he's being honest he's a more decent man than most of this board, that's for sure. He actually seems to hold principles and wants to move forward and do something positive instead of being a debased contrarian. I also expected more schizo-styled text after reading this thread but it's not so bad.
<<<

Thank you, anon. That is high praise. I do my best, [[WINTCIS]]. 

I think much of the structure (linking, tagging, [[alias]]ing, etc.) of the wiki, not just the writing-style, is schizo-styled. There's something to be said for making connections. I cannot say I do it wisely enough. I wish my [[ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱]] were easier to interpret. I recognize that my interlocutors pay very high prices with me in the long-run. 

<<<
reddit confirmed

...

when did this become reddit?
<<<

Yes.

I'm a [[Reddit]] addict and obviously a hiki degenerate. It's true. I would not be surprised if I used Reddit before you could read; same for this fine establishment.

`/blow-kiss`

For the record, I strongly appreciate the desire to punish those who don't [[aim]] to anonymize themselves in online public social interactions. There's something to be said for that, and I think my [[ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱]] is a useful discussion point here. In no small part, I [[PSM]] in virtue of some version of the ethos you've probably picked.

<<<
It's not root access. The site is built on Tiddlywinks which is 100% open source and saved to a single index.html. You can save your own copy of the entire site, while any changes made to the online version aren't saved server-side. Refresh the page and your own entries disappear.

t. looked under the hood since I really like how he set up his site

...

Tiddlywiki, I mean.
<<<

Well, I'm glad you like the setup. Feel free to [[contact]] me! I'm happy to think about your wiki, your life, and more with you, [[nomad]]. It's always my honor to meet a stranger in the desert.

<<<
    wish I were decent at putting myself in a creative trance like that. clever game.
<<<

Thank you, anon. To be clear, it is not merely a [[game]] to me, and I [[hope]] it is more than clever (though I want to be clever too!). [[The Existential Game]] is expensive to play well. I feel like I play this [[game]] in hard mode sometimes. 

You may find it a lot of fun, but there are some really hard places to work on in here too. I prefer to think of it more as a discipline than a trance (a discipline that leverages and even makes spaces for entering those flowstates and creative trances sometimes though). 

It helps that I enjoy price-efficient grinding in [[vidya]] [[games]]. I have played and botted plenty, and I'm used to spending a ton of time {[[Focus]]}ing on what is usually considered tedious (I'm a fuckin' autist, anon, as you know). Working every day in this [[ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱]] is like that often enough.

I appreciate the sentiment. I would even go so far as to say that most people really don't care about anyone but themselves when they do care about anything. I have found exceptions in the world though. I'm going to keep looking.

Oh, it gets even worse when you start using some of the tooling inside. I'm sorry. I have considered this before (e.g. [[2018.10.19 - Josiah: Tailoring]], and you can search for more, just not likely on mobile, hehe). For now, that's where I'm stuck. I would have no idea how to make this even 80% as functional on mobile.
