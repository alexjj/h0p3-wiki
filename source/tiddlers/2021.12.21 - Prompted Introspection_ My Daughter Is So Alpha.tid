title: 2021.12.21 - Prompted Introspection: My Daughter Is So Alpha

!! In as much detail as possible, capture one favorite memory you've created with your loved ones.

I've only mentioned this story [[here|Smelting Muh Silly Farts: ð“‚º]] with some faint allusions otherwise, IIRC. This is, by far, [[j3d1h]]'s most favoritest story (my son can't remember shit though). When my brother [[JRE]] and I were very young, we learned how vaccines worked, and we thought it cool (it is cool). I started vaccinating my brother against feces by bringing my butt right up against him and farting on him. I was a very clever young man (I'm now an old ~~fart~~ retard, tyvm). This shit never got old. I'd fart through the years, and once in a while that maymay would play out in the conversation (right now, I say "2 points" to all successful farts and burps in the room, and a 3-pointer must be __earned__ through outrageous behavior [I don't fucking hand those out for just any attempt at immortality]). Anyway, once I grew up by having had offspring, I decided it was pretty crucial to pass down this wisdom to them. These are important facts they needed to understand, and what better way to teach it than by farting on each [[other]]? [[Share]] the [[love]] (ikr?).<<ref "jc">> 

This story occurs probably months before [[ALM]] moved in with us in New Orleans. My daughter is 6, my son 4 (mind you, this girl is taking symbolic logic at Tulane, destroying all the dumb fucks in my classes - I'd call on her to answer a question when everyone else failed in order to shame them a bit).<<ref "ia">> I'm standing in the living room with mi amor, and my son comes running into the room screaming. He's got shit all over him (both of my offspring were potty-trained at 2, though they did have some accidents when we moved back to The States with a much, much colder climate), but that hadn't fully registered with me. Behind him I hear my daughter running and screaming over him, "I didn't do it! I didn't do it!" (IIRC*). But, she's [[naked]], and clearly, she has shit on her ass like a kid with chocolate cake smeared on their face. Once I figured out they were safe (drop down 2 emergency priority modes), I came to my senses and asked them what happened (because, I'm deeply confused, and I really don't like being lied to, again, IIRC*). So, she spits out the story (my son is //just// learning to say words [though he understands a great deal by this point]). She [[naked]]ly wrestled her brother down to the ground, declared her intent to vaccinate him (so alpha), and shat all over his chest. (That's what you get!). I almost died laughing. I was unable to respond seriously about anything for half an hour. My wife tried to take a motherly tone to handle it, but I was laughing so hard she couldn't keep a straight face either. We sort of gave up parenting right there. I had to go call every person I knew in the middle of the night to explain how fucking [[awe]]some my daughter is. I have no idea how [[1uxb0x]] is going to pay her back, but it's going to be epic.

<<footnotes "jc" "I just checked the /r/girlsfarting subplebbit I began many years ago as a joke, and I'd like to congratulate the degenerates who have grown it to 25k subs. It's well-curated (though not what I intended), and I left it in good hands (though they did not engage in democracy as I would prefer). There are probably very few places on the web as dedicated and successful in this particular mission. Godspeed, motherfuckers.">>
