"""
[8:32:55][DigidocTN] Thank you for your shares.
[8:33:18][DigidocTN] Help yourself from my collection.
[11:53:29][h0p3] Np. You have a beautiful collection. It's a pleasure to meet you.
[11:56:55][DigidocTN] I xan share other drives on request.
[11:57:10][DigidocTN] I spane 35 hard drives.
[12:23:58][h0p3] That's a ton. I suppose it must be difficult to have them online shared at the same time.
[12:34:16][DigidocTN] I can share 7 at once.
[12:35:22][h0p3] Are they externals or do you hotswap, or how do you manage?
[14:24:38][DigidocTN] I pause all transfers, and then swad them out.
[14:29:18][h0p3] Reminds me some of compact shelving in libraries.
[14:30:08][h0p3] How many TBs you got across the 35? Do you have any redundancy? How'd you acquire this much of a library? It's pretty amazing.
[14:31:00][DigidocTN] I have collected for 25 years.
[14:31:14][h0p3] `/nod`.
[14:31:19][h0p3] You do the rips by hand?
[14:31:21][DigidocTN] Since the early days of Napster.
[14:31:53][DigidocTN] Some I did myself. Most were downloaded
[14:32:03][h0p3] You ever use Scour exchange back in the day?
[14:32:12][DigidocTN] no
[14:36:16][h0p3] If it can be afforded, Unraid may be a worthy option.
[14:43:58][DigidocTN] I have lost a couple drives with files.
[14:44:27][DigidocTN] I have a list, so I start looking again.
[14:45:04][h0p3] `/nod`. I keep my lists too. I lost a set of drives long ago. Heartbreaking.
[14:45:45][h0p3] Here's my [[Music: Library]]: https://philosopher.life/#Music%3A%20Library
[15:07:04][DigidocTN] You have a few dozen I like. Most you have, Inever heard of.
[15:07:42][DigidocTN] our differences are what makes us interesting.
[17:19:39][h0p3] There is something to be said for being interesting and interested.
[17:20:42][DigidocTN] agreed
[17:21:53][DigidocTN] I a retired engineer. In a wheel chair. I struggle with one leg amputated BK
[17:22:25][h0p3] Ah, how'd that happen? 
[17:22:30][h0p3] What kind of engineering did you do?
[17:22:49][h0p3] I've had a lot of different jobs over the years. 
[17:23:22][DigidocTN] Computer hardware,
[17:23:37][DigidocTN] The leg was diabetes.
[17:23:49][h0p3] I hear it knocking on my door too.
[17:24:07][h0p3] What kind of hardware? What aspects did you work on?
[17:24:23][h0p3] You still do a lot of reading on the topic?
[17:24:26][DigidocTN] Test Often so you know.
[17:25:18][DigidocTN] Everything from desktops to mid-range and even Honeywell mainframes.
[17:27:39][h0p3] Never got to play with a mainframe before. 
[17:27:51][h0p3] Bet that was interesting.
[17:28:25][h0p3] Had a friend I worked with once who handled the mainframe at our megacorp. Very curious dude. Arcane knowledge only he knew.
[17:28:44][h0p3] So how you do enjoy passing the time these days?
[17:28:55][DigidocTN] Some of the mainframes use several thousand cores to work in tandem, perhaps 40 terabytes of memory.
[17:29:24][DigidocTN] collecting and sharing media.
[17:29:55][DigidocTN] I use SS of course. I also use Gigatribe.
[17:30:32][h0p3] I've little experience with Gigatribe.
[17:30:37][h0p3] What do you like about it?
[18:06:44][DigidocTN] it is good for sharing and for chatting.
[18:07:17][DigidocTN] I remote in and help people around the world. Use Teamviewer
[18:09:12][h0p3] I admire that.
[18:20:43][h0p3] Joined up and invited.
[18:22:20][DigidocTN] just accepted
[18:22:42][DigidocTN] Want me to get you more contacts?
[18:22:52][h0p3] Yeah, I'd like that.
[18:23:00][h0p3] Seems like a friend-to-friend network.
[18:23:28][h0p3] There's some other tools you might consider: Fopnu, [[DarkMX]], [[MuWire]], Retroshare, aMule, gnutella, and DC++. 
[18:23:33][h0p3] What kind of upload speed you got?
[18:23:45][h0p3] It's not great where I live in CT.
[18:24:19][DigidocTN] I have 1000 in both directions. Fiber direct to my hope
[18:24:39][h0p3] Lawd have mercy, that is dope.
