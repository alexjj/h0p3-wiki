; 1588-1679: Hobbes

* The universe consists of matter in motion, and nothing else exists; it is a vast machine.
* Every moving object, including human beings, is some sort of machine.
* Our bodies continuously cast and acquire tissue but a person is always the same person because of the unbroken nature of the flux.
* All mental processes consist of movements of matter inside the skull.
* Psychological motivations are sorts of pushes: appetites and aversions.
* Each person acts for some good to themselves, and appetites define what is good for each of us.
* Appetites (liking, love, etc.) are inherently unsatisfiable; they cannot cease until death.
* The strongest aversion is the fear of death.
* At the bottom, the fear of death causes people to form societies.
* In the state of nature there is no order of justice, violence and cunning rules; life is solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.
* The societal alliances should be such that it is not in anyone's interest to break laws.
* Everyone should hand over power to a central authority with absolute power who imposes law.
* The central authority holds its power from people, to protect their freedom and safety.
* Any tyranny is better than social chaos.
* A man should be contented with so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself.
