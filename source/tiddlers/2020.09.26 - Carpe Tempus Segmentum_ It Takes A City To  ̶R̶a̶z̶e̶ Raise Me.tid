title: 2020.09.26 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: It Takes A City To  ̶R̶a̶z̶e̶ Raise Me

//May be it a minor <<tag "Relic">>and limerence too.//

Okay. Switchin' it up maybe. I need more of this text.

* Read
* AFireman Time!
* Attempted to sleep at 2.
** Did not happen. 5 hours of just racing in my head.
*** GOD FUCKING DAMNIT! 
* Read
* [[Morning Routine]]
* I hear NPR blathering. Real smooth moves and a very well-made argument + a timed bet.
* Inform the Men!
** Got'em. 2 minutes to spare.
* Shower of the gods!
* Coffee + Cookie
* Went to look at places to live.
** I never feel like I belong anywhere, especially not with these wealthy people.
** Telescope, Jewish, KY, Chocolate, Banal, Hobbit, Fiddy
** Found 3 that would be pretty awesome.
** We went out to eat as a family! Subway! 
*** Omg, stupid expensive. 8 fucking dollars for a 6-inch sub. 
**** My daughter pulled me aside to think about capitalism. She is paying attention to how the humans around her are being treated.
** Agent got to know us all better. Talked shit about millennials. Didn't realize I am one. Recovery compliment that I am more mature than my age and not like the others. Boomers (it's my turn to talk shit ;P).
*** Her daughter is my age.
** There are limits to the fixer-uppertude we could accept (which sucks because I would love to pour my labor into something solid...and, y u m), and the butterzone is bigger than we need (who doesn't like it thicc and juicy tho?). 
** She has two children who work at Yale. Shoptalk.
** She's much wealthier than she lets on (I like that drive the shittiest vehicle possible but own millions in assets thing). She works non-stop too. I'm sure it would be very expensive to think about justice for her.
** A non-trivial commute feels inevitable. =(.
** Still no solid numbers yet though.
** I feel guilty getting a house. I know this feeling in me to acquire, to pursue safety into oblivion (beyond sane prep), to insulate myself. I know it doesn't solve my real problems, although it makes it easier to ignore. 
*** I feel better recognizing that I don't really own the house. It's just another version of renting where we are more likely to be rewarded in capital. I feel better recognizing I'm trying to find a cheap method to rent too. I feel better recognizing that I have to find a way for my wife to live sanely (with the few marbles she'll have left) when I'm gone. 
*** I feel guilty just planning all the things I'd want to do in the house too. It's easier for me in a [[vidya]] [[game]] where I can plan out the esoteric character in a world. Absolute [[power]] within limits!<<ref "i">> Lmao. I never have enough right to shed my depression and anxiety; honesty in empathizing at a grand scale requires it.
*** I'm excited that maybe another family would live with us. I would like to house people. I also know that I'm unbearable, and I like having a house where I'm allowed to be myself without the constant guard. My pursuit of safety is not sane enough though, and I don't have a right to my feelings as much as I'd like.
*** I'm {[[dream]]}ing about being a pure basement-dweller. I'm dreaming of having [[monster-16]] fully accessible from both the basement and the living room, literally two desks (KVMed to spare others the amount of cum and horse cock<<ref "t">> that I enjoy). 
**** I want a real urinal (or a trough where all the bois can compare and sword fight). I want a shower that entices my woman to strip for me and dance in mist for an hour every day (I want to touch her boobs too). I want a house where people thoroughly enjoy fucking (I want us to be happy to hear moans and to smile in pleasure that people are getting laid). I have no idea what to say about the irony: I don't want the planned party; I want the spontaneous one. Who would even want to come to my party? I want the world to be pragmatically idealized into porn (awww yiss). I want a cabinet of my own (something I trust for more than a few years) that was worth keeping organized to my autistic preferences that normally I've had to set aside to just survive in the chaos. I want a real work-shop, one that my brother [[JRE]] would come up just to show me how to use. I want a kitchen that [[AIR]] respects and enjoys being in with me. I want a neckbeard's home, one where people know they have to be disgusting with me. I don't want to feel guilty about my sleep schedule. I want a ping-pong table to have a physical game that my offspring adore playing with me, where they'd put-up with who I am just to have some fun at the table - no philosophy beyond smack-talking and pulling back from the world just to think about how to practice our wicked english. I want a DnD table that one day has my [[Root Users]] teaching me how to roleplay (I'm picking Senpai [[chameleon]] to DM for us). I want routines that make us happy. I want to hear [[DeathOfRobinhood]] pray in our house, to bless our evening. I want to grow weed, salvia, and mushrooms. I want to make moonshine with [[gh057]]. I don't ever want to grow up. Fuck that shit. I want to live absolutely [[naked]] in my basement, fire-off my pirated signal into a [[The Matrix]]. I want to go on walks, to have 10-100 paths into the world that I knew. I want to be mindlessly in the world sometimes, and I want to be right there sometimes too. I want to sit in the city speaking with others about what matters most. I want to feel like I belong in the world. Perfectly Maslowian, surely.
***** What Hebrew does not yearn for this? I do believe in the possibility of The City worth existin in its own right.
* Migraine hit her. Woozy.
* Chores
* Read+Write+LoL
* Sleep by 5:30. Zonk.
* Woke with that anxiety pinch in my neck at 10:30
* Cleaning
* [[k0sh3k]] seems better, but her tummy. 
* Walked through housing. 
** I have spent more time agonizing over a dollar's worth of items in a video game. God, I'm stupidly fucking irrational here. It's not like there appears to be so many other options though. I can't just logoff, and my character does need a pot in which to piss. Exercising the Socrates in [[Saint Diogenesocrates]].
* Read+Write

I think today has been stressful but damned good too. It was one to remember. Anthem for the day: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qetW6R9Jxs4. It's been a gradual skin in the game day. Good day.
