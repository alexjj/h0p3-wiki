; 1906-1975: Arendt

* The appeal of totalitarian ideologies rests upon the devastation of ordered and stable contexts in which people once lived.
* There are three types of human activities: labor, work, and action (in ascending hierarchy of importance)
* Labor is the biological practices necessary for the maintenance of life: an animal-like, unfree, private activity with impermanent products.
* Work is the fabrication of quasi-permanent physical and cultural artifacts: a non-animal, public activity with some degree of freedom
* The rise of 'animal laborans' threatens the extinction of 'homo faber' and what makes a community's public life possible ('world alienation')
* Authentic human action can initiate the wholly new - unanticipated, unconditioned by the laws of cause and effect.
* Actions cannot be justified for their own sake, but only in light of their public recognition and the shared rules of a political community
* The raison d'etre of politics is freedom, and its field of experience is action.
* Evil doesn't always come from malevolence; failures of thinking and judgment, sometimes abused by political systems, can result in evil.
* A disinterested and imaginatively publicly minded form of political judgment is required to tackle the new circumstances of the modern era.
