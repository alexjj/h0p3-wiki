title: 2020.08.10 - Prompted Introspection: Seeing gh057s

!! Which person would you like to see more often than you do now?

I'm assuming you mean I've seen them with my own eyes before. There's a lot of people on this list. That's something to celebrate. It's nice to have people I want to see.<<ref "t">> [[gh057]] is someone that I had intended to see more often. I assumed we would have more time (I didn't think we'd be lucky enough to find a position like we did so quickly). Last couple times we got together, we got wicked drunk. I would like to get him high AF. We could just watch [[Psychedelic Videos]] and listen to music. I dislike the thought that we might not actually get to see each other face to face again. We'll see though. There's generally [[hope]]. I liked getting to learn his family's stories, meeting his son, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter too at the end. I'm gonna bet that little girl will be taller than I am if and when I do get to see her again.
