title: 2020.12.20 - Prompted Introspection: Marry Me, Maeby, Baby

!! You have to marry someone in this room right now. Who is it?

It's just me again. I'm not a valid target.

I tend to write alone.<<ref "e">> Writing is so much more expensive than reading. It's difficult to accept interruptions while writing (it mangles my train of thought), but reading is more forgiving, especially [[hyperreading]] which tends to be comprised largely of rapidfire interruptions in a grind (hunting for that which is worth deeper inspection). 

This question is painful for me, and I'm going to sound even more [[arrogant]] and elitist than usual. Attraction isn't sufficient here. I find it extremely difficult to find people with whom I would be equally yoked. I require an interpreter in a way [[most|2020.05.02 - APonting: Soft Dance]] would not understand. I can find people with IQs and pieces of paper as high as hers, but I can't find people who pursue what matters (and have acquired knowledge of it) like she does at that level (it takes a lifetime and [[Moral Luck]]). And, more problematically, bridging to me requires an extreme patience, tolerance of my retardations, parallel dysfunctionality, ferocious street combat in the pocket (most of the highly educated people I've met are so privileged, they've never experienced anything like it),<<ref "r">> insane accountability, and hyperreligiousity that is usually pressured out of most brilliant minds if they wish to have any status and semblance of consistent hedonic happiness in the world. [[k0sh3k]]'s background plays such a significant role in why we are simpatico.<<ref "s">> 

[[k0sh3k]] would not be able to accept another me in her life,<<ref "l">> but I could handle another two of her in mine (I'm the exhausting madman in the desert, and she's the eternal well).<<ref "t">> In some ways, I think this is what [[FTO]] is doing though. [[Friendship]]s come in [[dok]], but given my unlikable disposition, harsh judgment, absurd intensity, and broad knowledge requirements, [[intimacy]] as a matter of reciprocal proportions becomes extremely rare for me (for a variety of reasons, I tend to understand [[others]] better than they understand me, and that only gets worse with age from what I can see). In a sense, to have connected with me (and, only [[k0sh3k]] speaks about my full set of {[[Axioms]]} with me [most obviously avoid it], even though it must be in her own tongue) requires as much work as a marriage, even if it wasn't specifically with me. I don't have much [[hope]] for how I spend my Dunbar numbers, and that's despite all the hacks, mods, filters, crawlers, and fishers I've used. Even one more like [[k0sh3k]] would be amazing, but I don't think they exist.

I think that's one of the more interesting parts of coming to Yale. I've always known my wife is a genius, but I'm kinda disappointed by the people here.<<ref "m">> Apparently, these are among the best in the world at what they do. Jesus Christ. We're all gonna suffer and die. The chances of another like my [[k0sh3k]] seem even lower than I would have predicted.<<ref "p">>

I am trying to lower my standards, be realistic, etc.

<<footnotes "e" "Even moreso now that [[monster-16]] is in the hikicave. I'm forcing myself to be upstairs to write to make sure I'm present.">>

<<footnotes "r" "Shout out to k0shiqua!">>

<<footnotes "s" "I suggest I require someone who understands me so well that I can see them as an existential threat (quite a wrestler) and yet feel safe with them. Otherwise, I've simply isolated an opponent and deemed them sufficiently benign (Mac's Patented Ocular Patdown). The vulnerability goes well beyond death or material; it's something else. I work hard to hand that [[power]] over even to my [[Root Users]] though. We will see.">>

<<footnotes "l" "But, lawd, we'd spitroast the living fuck out of her.">>

<<footnotes "t" "There remains what may be a three-body problem though.">>

<<footnotes "m" "I'm not even talking from a moral stance (which is obvious); I mean simply in terms of prowess. The thing she gets paid for isn't even her most impressive or most [[salient]] talent to my eyes (even if what she does is, pragmatically-speaking, the most feasible method of affecting change in her context).">>

<<footnotes "p" "I do have the ability to speak to children as my equal (who doesn't appreciate that level of curiosity and self-absorption? Who doesn't admire child-like wonder? Who doesn't think that being able to explain the universe as best we can to even a child isn't required? Who doesn't admire the creature that can't stop asking [[W5H]]?), but there is always an asymmetry in what can be [[shared]] (indeed, personhood begins for most by 16-months, and respect is owed; capacities [and desires, more importantly] vary though).
