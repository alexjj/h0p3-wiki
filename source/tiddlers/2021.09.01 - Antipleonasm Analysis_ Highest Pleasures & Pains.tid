title: 2021.09.01 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Highest Pleasures & Pains

!! Respond to [[the following|Why Not A Wide Area Network, Watson?]]:

<<<
Indeed, one of the highest pleasures is to be more or less unconscious of oneâ€™s own existence, to be absorbed in interesting sights, sounds, places, and people. Conversely, one of the greatest pains is to be self-conscious, to feel unabsorbed and cut off from the community and the surrounding world.

Yikes. That's perhaps comforting go-to-sleep-little-sheep rhetoric, but I don't see why it's true.

Living in low-energy flowstates, avoiding the anxiety of the present-at-hand, and just "being there" without much effort is something we've evolved to do; energy-efficiency (including relying upon near zero-cost abstractions)<<ref "ee">> is part of the drive behind our crystallization and the acceleration of the passage of time in our [[phenomenology]], and I can see why it's rewarded to some extent. In case it must be said, the edge of serenity of The Calm is not obviously pleasure. I also cannot claim that sustained unconsciousness of one's existence is all that pleasurable; it may be quite muted and flat really. Ignoring, flattening, or neutralizing our observations can help alleve suffering, but it tends to limit pleasure as well.<<ref "n">> There's definitely a time and place for giving one's mind a vacation, including from thinking about, feeling, and being so aware of one's own existence.<<ref "r">> Price-efficient pleasure is also something to value, though not as its own end.

Even the pursuit of minimal self-consciousness doesn't seem to fit either. Deeply experiencing and being open to interesting sights, sounds, places, and people may even require significant consciousness of one's embodied existence in those contexts too (even self-empathy comes in many orders). Throwing ourselves into novelty tends to require non-trivial self-awareness. So, you've strawmanned self-consciousness while failing to appreciate what may be necessary conditions for being absorbed in those activities. Great self-awareness appears to be a condition for even having the greatest pains and pleasures. I'll agree, however, that avoiding being aware of some areas of our own existence (even via lying to oneself) can make life more pleasurable.<<ref "s">>

Note that one of the highest pleasures is to be more or less as conscious as possible of one's own existence as well (that is quite Daseinic). I think it takes training and [[moral luck]] to have cultivated maximum pleasure from such a garden, but I think it's a greater pleasure in the end than simple ready-to-hand states. Moreover, satisfaction that is eudaimonic, not merely the hedonism you may be picking out, requires thinking about our existence consistently and quite thoroughly. Being absorbed in the now and living in the present is hardly an unconscious or non-self-conscious process, including of one's existence. Why should I think self-consciousness is empirically or conceptually linked to feeling cutoff from communities or the world?<<ref "a">> Appreciating one's relation to [[the other]] requires it. Those feelings of absorption<<ref "i">> and unity with [[The Other]] are only in virtue of this kind of self-awareness.

Regardless, the issue is less important than I think you imply. Pleasure is not a sufficient end; it is only a part of the normative story. There, too, self-consciousness is mandatory and the only mechanism by which we can make progress in the hard problems. There are excellent reasons for us to undergo such complex, rich, traumatic, testing pains, even if not for our own well-being, but [[FTSO]] [[others]]. Without it, we cannot empathize [[irwartfrr]]. One cannot [[love]] without enduring the pains of intentionality illuminated by self-consciousness. I'd rather have the pain.
