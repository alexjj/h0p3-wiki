title: 2021.03.22 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Pinephone Dream

Laundry, [[Weekly Check-In]], [[CGariety]], and [[TTTOTW]], as usual. Watching from afar, it's wonderful. Fireman Time!

Sleep by 5? Futurama rocking out. 

Woke early today, 2. Hugs'n'Bugs, offspring aren't proud, they did their chores though, assignments, [[Morning Routine]], new draft, matches with each. My son lost quickly in both (demoralized when thinking about our spaces), and my daughter absolutely demolished me (or my deck did...18 fucking lands, screwed after mulls in both games, only 3 in the G2). It was a horrific. =). Offspring's match is on G3, so we'll wait to see if we need to continue the tournament.

Was going to make sketti, but [[Scout]] took over and chose Indian food (which is wildly better than anything I could make). 

Localized-[[FTO]]. There's half a dozen exposures to ol'voldy that didn't exist before by my own hands. Hunting for people, trapped in these terrible fucking apps, and even the VM just can't make up for it. It's all garbage. Still, it's clear that the adults need to begin planting roots, finding friends, and that the role church played for us still need to be fixed because we don't have them come over to our house. Neighbors will be the best way to go, but it's got its own perils.

//Skintime//, she talked a lot more today for me, and I got to listen. Skin. Lawd. Assisted Fireman Time! 

[[TTTOTW]]. Called [[JRE]] up.

[[Family Gathering]] with insane Indian food. Every house has a special curry blend. We probably have ours now. =). May the cube be so as well. Offspring battled, and the adults took the other table and watched from afar. Lots of discussions surrounding it. This match showed more holes in their understanding of the game. 

A discussion about the Pinephone. I talked with my offspring. Gave her the 5 minute clock on me, the anti-talking-toy. That's what I talked about first. We all laughed. Okay. Pinephone, T1 Hypervisor, Whatever Ecosystems We Felt Worthy, OS Modes, etc.

[[TTTOTW]]. Vapelyfe with bro. He's been working on the wiki. Sick, breh. [[BDS97]] conversation rolls along.
