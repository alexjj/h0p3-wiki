title: 2021.08.06 - Prompted Introspection: Not Feeling It

!! Do you have more thoughts or more feelings?

What kind of crack are you smoking, Samwise? I don't think these peel apart cleanly. I don't think anyone has a clear understanding of what this question entails, nor do I think self-reporting is viable in this arena. I'm not here to validate people who don't respect cognition as the only verifiable medium through which we can even attempt to translate our feelings with each other (let alone seek that which is external to us). However, I'm obviously someone who thinks our feelings are fundamental to having a cognition like ours. 

You want a guess? Alright, let's, for the sake of argument, peel them apart. I bet I'm constantly in a state of feeling (even if I'm not aware of it at top level), but I'm not always constantly in a state of thinking (though, it's hard not to see how inferences aren't being made; perhaps even our nerve endings do so). I bet that my feelings are actually at least millions of feelings weighted with each continuously in parallel, and my thoughts will tend to be more single-threaded and slower.

I'm not saying the quantity doesn't matter, but it almost doesn't. Cognition is the hard part. I think your question isn't a great one, Samwise, and I feel you are wasting my time.
