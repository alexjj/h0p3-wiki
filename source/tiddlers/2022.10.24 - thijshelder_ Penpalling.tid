Dear thijshelder,

I'm glad to hear back from you, and it's dope that you [[love]] writing back and forth.<<ref "i">> I do my best, [[WINTCIS]]. I can't say I encounter many who reciprocate, especially in the long-run.<<ref "o">> I'm not much of a [[smalltalk]]er; life is short. Who else do you read and write with when you have the [[chance]]? Which of your relationships have been the most important to you in life?

> Thanks. I am honestly not too great at Reddit, even though I have been here a while. 

I think most lurk on [[Reddit]] for years before they end up making an account, if they do at all. I can't say I'm sufficiently skilled either, though I work to be.<<ref "af">> What do you think consists in being great at Reddit? 

I'm still thinkin' about your [[Public Self-Model]], which I take your Reddit account to be at least a part. Do you have anywhere else I should digest? I'm especially interested in words you are committed to. 

I've a bunch of questions to start us off:

* In your experience, what is the reason "[[forcing a romantic attraction is dangerous|https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/q20q6e/regarding_attraction_does_anyone_else_feel/hfi2n5y/]]"? 
* You have said that [[you are poor|https://www.reddit.com/r/amcstock/comments/p6jkfy/i_am_poor/]], but I'm pretty sure a bot deleted your post before it could be [[captured|https://www.reveddit.com/v/amcstock/comments/p6jkfy/i_am_poor/?post_flair=%22%5ETopic%5C%2B%F0%9F%94%8A%24%22]]. What were you hoping to express to that community?
** How do you do to survive in this world?
* Do you play guitar, or what sorts of instruments do you play? How long you been playing? How'd you get into it?
* Where'd you go to school? Do you regret it? 
** Are you still religious? What matters to you?
** What do you think of this thing they call postmodernism?
** What do you think Jesus would have to say to your professors? What do you think he would say about the US in general?
*** Saint Marx was never taught in any of my classes. 
* Do you think some kinds of injustice have a higher moral priority than others?
* What are we supposed to do with our lives?
* You say you grew up semi-fundamentalist. What was that like? How did your [[faith]] [[change]] over the years?
* What makes you say "there is very little inclusion in the modern LGBT community"?

I'm going to wait to ask more. I've a billion questions. Feel free to take your time responding. We speak when we can. `/nod`.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
