title: 2020.12.12 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Organizing

* Read+Write+//GoT//
* Fireman Time!
* Sleep by 3
* Woke at 10
** On and off sleep, awful. Felt more like 4-5.
* Inform the Men!
* Son and I modified MUC to include B2B, history of the deck, permutations surrounding abuse of this card
** Wishboard is taking better shape. Glad to see him walking through our extra cards piles for possible cards he'd want in the deck.
*** Pst: https://scryfall.com/ and https://www.tcgplayer.com/
** Hopefully, he'll keep his [[MTG]] decklists and notes in his wiki. Seems perfect for it. It's a good age to be addicted to textfiles too, I suppose. `/salute`
** Son's Affinity vs MG Forest Ramp +3: I open zealot (soz) and beacon before he opens. I mistakenly chord for dungrove when I should have just convoked for titan (which I did on my second). Some errors on his part, but I think +2 would have fit better.
* My daughter was exceptionally unhappy to have to work today. She needs a break. I think we shouldn't do any house work (beyond basic kitchen) tomorrow. 
* Unpacking, Cleaning, Fixing
** Bathroom
*** Scoured top to bottom. 
*** Toilet and seat are no longer loose. 
*** Curtains curtailed until they'll be hemmed.
*** Medicine cabinet fixed. 
*** Shelf mounted. This $5 purchase from a fleamarket has stayed with us for so long, and it's been really good to us: fits like a glove too. 
*** Organization complete (well, first round). Everyone has a shelf in the closet, overflow closet is sane, girls went through everything to make sure they want it there. 
**** I'm taking the extra shit on mine, and I will take all primary requirements. I never want to have to guess where to find the thermometer, bandaids, painmeds, etc.. My space is the keeper.
**** I give it 20% chance that it will stay that way. 
*** Noticed after my son's shower that there's nothing enabling moisture to escape. Hrm.
** Stairway Rails tightened, but there is still a loose piece. The wall is damaged there. Not sure how best to fix it since it should bear weight.
*** Looking at this stairway, thinking about my wife in a few decades, and I'm glad there's a driveway that ramps down to the garage instead. 
** Some headway made in the basement. At least it is dry and there's pathing.
** Doors, Cabinets, & Hinges
*** Whoever flipped the house did it in a hurry. Hardware appears stripped out of another house (though they are sturdier than most of the pieces I've had throughout my life), there's missing pieces, and it was installed crooked plenty. I did what I could to fix the doors and cabinets. A real fix would be expensive, and it's not worth it. I will admire the charm instead.
**** I'm also [[grateful]] that my offspring are older now. I think there's a chance these objects will last longer.
*** Waxing worked. Glad my brother pointed out why there was wax in the kitchen. It works. We'll see how long it lasts.
*** Attic door frame and door are not parallel. This thing was tacked on. 
** Wife's desk is complete. It's nice, especially for that price. Fits her corner perfectly. 
*** She's already throwing everything on it. I know her. ;P. I think in time, it will grow to house plenty. May that desk last her a lifetime.
*** Her favorite chair fits like a glove and right next to the radiator. May she read countless books warmed by it.
*** Her room is now 75% there (well, first pass).  
* [[JRE]] Called
** Bringing a gift to [[AIR]]. 
** Quinn's biomom was trying to make that call through the rehab center. Rebecca must be extra tired or something. Her reaction was very much unlike her. 
** Trying meds earlier. Needs sleep badly. No dreams this time.
** He made a FB post about the evolution of parenting, how we confabulate affection to handle what is disgusting through necessity, etc. He called it cognitive dissonance, and it may be it. I wonder who he's looking to respond to it.
*** Hypothesis: Parenting is the practice of applied cognitive dissonance resolution; you don't want to change the nastiest diaper you could possibly imagine, but you also want to take care of your kid because you love them.  The resolution (changing the diaper) actually makes you love your kid more. Use: Feed your kid alternating treatments of laxatives and cheese to help foster a deeper sense of love.
** His new Oculus comes in, gonna get high tonight, will be the last for a long time.   
* Bleachwater sprayed the mattress, continue to fan-dry it. Second round.
* I'm surprised by the amount of laundry we can push. They gave us the extra-large sized ones because they didn't have the cheapest we purchased. 
** I could see another dryer being worthy though, especially since they don't tend to last too long with us. Not wired for it. 
* Ghetto pingpong table has been started. It's cold up there. 
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Son's MUC vs Gobbos: Lackey, vial, vial, chief open...he did land a B2B but never developed. Mere junk and fanatics take it.
** Daughter's Affinity vs Son's MUC: B2B hit like a Mac truck. Have suggested Nature's Claim to my daughter. They should practice sideboarding and construction again. The game cannot be understood without it.
** Steak, green beans, fruit, rum, carrot cake
* Nap
** Poyfect. Also, that couch sucks for sleeping. After trying our old mattress again, I'm spoiled again. Given the modification I made to the mattress, I could prop it up as a couch (because I adore having the back), but I'm going to wait for now. Practice my manspreading underneath the weighted blanket.
* Mattress seems good. Wrapped it in my semi-plastic piss sheet again.
** It's not watertight. I suppose this is a fine way to learn it. It could have gotten awkward, and that's, like, that last thing I need in my life. 
* Hugged folks off to bed.
* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!

I kinda admire what the original owners did (found their pictures in the wall). For example, they done some work to chink the cracks of doorways. Hank Hill would not have approved of the craftsmanship, but he'd admire that it was done by the owner. Even the extra bit of asphalt near the garage makes sense for keeping water out (also, there's a drain in the garage, but I have no idea where it goes [maybe it's just a catch?]).
