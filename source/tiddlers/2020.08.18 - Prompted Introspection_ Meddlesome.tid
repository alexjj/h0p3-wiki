title: 2020.08.18 - Prompted Introspection: Meddlesome

!! What is the best way to treat meddlesome people?

[[gfwiwcgws]]? Also, it's not so easy to pick out what it means to be meddlesome. I'll agree that meddlesomeness has a negative connotation, but a lot of cases in which the average person would take someone to be meddlesome wouldn't be problematic to my eyes. I'm fine ignoring meddlers in many cases. Will I call out an instigator? Sometimes. I prefer to try to include and make sense of meddlers if I can, but sometimes the best option is to live in a way that disincentivizes meddling. Let us say that we are speaking of the sinister class of meddlesome people that I take to be my enemy.

Thankfully, I am nobody to most of the people I hate (and [[love]] for that matter). Some meddlers have to pay a price with me though (even if I am exploitable). This becomes more apparent over time, particularly for the dark triads I've met.<<ref "a">> I don't think I'm a fun enemy to have. I'm crazy, and it's obvious I'm crazy. It makes little sense to fuck with crazy people, especially if they feel like they have little to lose. I'm willing to escalate into absurd spaces just for the fun of it (let alone my vocation), lol. Even as a predictable zealot, there are places where I will bet all my existential chips where others won't ("[[CTS]]"); so, it's inadvisable to play some games with me. I have a long memory (not even including receipts), I'm obsessive (sometimes even ambitious), I'm just barely intelligent and knowledgeable enough to be dangerous, I'm perfectionistically competitive, I'm willing to go for the throat (though I aim to be justified), and while I'm not impulsive or much of a risk-taker, I'll turn on a dime full-force if I'm convinced of the justification (maybe like an Ent). Most people have envisioned taking another human's life. For a fool-hardy planner like me, I know exactly how I would take many people's lives. That I am not Rorschach (albeit a far less competent and flashy one) is a choice. Generally though, I'm so god damn boring, backburner leashably useful, exhausting, or annoying to interact with that most meddlers don't so much. 

I think meddlesomeness (at this point, the word may appear almost unrecognizable) that is evil is traceable to exploitation in material dialectics in a surprising percentage of cases. Really, this is a question of [[Justice]]. I'm doing what I can. I work to take the high road, to be "civil." I'd prefer to limit violence to mere ad hominem if I can; I work hard to be tolerant too. I prefer to reason with evil people (even though very few change their minds). If grace and mercy beyond what is owed is not what we'll hand to our enemies, then we're going to have to scale up the retribution (even qua the pursuit of restoration). Yeah, we can flip the switch. On those grounds, my suggestion is to literally kill the wealthy. All of them. I've never met one that merited their lives. Yup, go on and roll the dice with the [[power]] vacuum.

<<footnotes "a" "I've attempted to become adept at demonstrating to the psychopaths I know that the only thing that holds me back is a moral hedge (the source of my dignity). It's quite a moralfag gulf. I've been patient, consistent, and even kind in how I flash that I'm-not-trapped-in-here-with-you;-you're-trapped-in-here-with-me.grin (though it upsets the dumber ones). If I played by their rules, if I turned my incompetent autistic empathy off (and worked to shed my habits), I'd be a monster. I despise the idea though, and I'd rather think of happy thoughts! I've met plenty who identify with //Dexter//, which is funny to me: the character clearly lacked ambition and failed to appreciate his calling. Thankfully, from my own proof, I have [[hope]] that people can radically change (however small the probability). It's easy to [[Love]] 3% of adult homo sapien specimens, but it is so very expensive to [[Love]] the mere fragments of Humanity remaining in the other 97%. I think that's what it's like in [[Self-Dialectic]] too.">>
