title: 2021.07.24 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Til We Dropped

[[TTTOTW]]. Drinking fluids to prevent hangover. Trying to soak my feet (water is way too hot) in prep for a possible hike with fam tomorrow, Dark Chocolate, and ADHD-skipping in [[TTTOTW]].

Sleep by 4? Woke at 11? Liver. Ugh. Assignments. They were offered the chance to go out into the world after chores+shopping, and they said they'd rather just use the time to chill. They clearly did take their chill time.

Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

Shopping @ Coffee Store. While she went in, I checked out a new smoke shop (this is right next to our previous residence, still the closest coffee shop). Prices were out of control. $100 for a gram of Δ⁸ distillate. They were selling flower (and, I don't know how, since it shouldn't be legal just yet...soon^^tm^^). He didn't understand his own product upon questioning either (can't help me with the tank - he only sells the disposables unless its for nicotine), though he looked at me like I was retarded (and, I am, `/nod`). It became evident that I had annoyed him by having looked through the entire inventory. `/shrug`. 

Shopping @ Burlington with immediate fam. I got a pair of shoes that I think will last longer, $20, composite toe, slip-on workboots? Cool. Made for an autist, and I like their construction. Everyone else got clothes. Daughter is going for an androgynous look, my wife found several pieces with pockets that look good on her (I always join in on the dressing room), and my son almost lost his cool. It brings me back to my childhood, where I can count on one hand how many times we shopped for clothes like this (I was given or bought second-hand most of my own from 12+); it can be an unfun experience for an autist (on top of what sucks about being a poor kid around assholes) who isn't so good at putting clothes on in the first place (never found shopping with the donors to be particularly pleasant either). We got over the hurdle though, acknowledged, reasoned, soothed, and it became fun again. He did a good job thinking about it. I'm glad. We eventually left the girls to finish the job, and the boys hit our old W-Entity and Aldi. They didn't have shorts for him that were any better there. Picked up the rare ginger beer and some car-pies. Almost ran out of gas on the way back, but that was fine too.

Shopping @ Costco with mi amor. I was more brutal in weeding, and there weren't any big ticket items to get. We got plenty though. I'm beginning to know the pricing between our three grocery stores, and there's fewer things to try out. I need to make sure to stock up on dried mushrooms anytime they have it (since it's not regular). We had our new classic hotdog date, but this time with tables. Oh, [[k0sh3k]] really wanted the tumbler Costco was giving away with auto-renewal. Since we had it already, she had to switch to another card. Lady at the desk laughed, sang, and danced. She was a firecracker.

Shopping @ Aldi with mi amor. Stocked up across the board. We barely fit everything into our freezers and fridge (right at the line). We buy a variety of breads now. It's nice. We have fresh food again. =).

Shopping @ W-Entity with mi amor. Saw broski at work! He do be makin' pretty cakes. We got to talking to him, but then I think we got him in mild trouble (lady on the phone shushed us all ^^can't you see this person was helping a customer, woman?^^). Rockit apples aint bad at all. Over a thousand dollars today. Helluva day of house shopping. 

//Skintime// + //The Office//. Inform the Men! Meditation. 

Offspring have not completed their tasks, and they admitted they've not tried hard enough. Passive aggressive molasses. Classic. One day, they'll figure out they are burning their time, and it can't be soon enough. 

She came down to work on her wiki while I worked on mine. It's been a helluva day. [[TTTOTW]]. //Skintime//.

Hummus, pita, olives, water + LolVod.
