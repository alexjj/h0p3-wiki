; 341-170 BC: Epicurus

* All there is in the universe are atoms and space.
* Atoms are indestructible and eternal, but their combinations (objects) are always changing.
* We, body and mind, are among the ephemeral objects built of atoms.
* What enables us to be free is the existence of certain randomness (swerve) in the motions of our atoms.
* Don't fear death; so long as you exist, death is not, and when death is, you are not.
* Gods are far away and have no desire to be involved with us; it's as if they don't exist.
* Happiness in this world should be our aim.
* The way to be happy is to withdraw from public life into private communities of like-minded people.
* We should enjoy pleasures in moderation, though no non-injurious activity needs to be forbidden.
* The greatest pleasure is attainable through knowledge, friendship, and with freedom from fear.
