title: 2020.05.21 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Gratitude

* Woke at 11:30
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Dialectures
* TW Canvassing
* Listened to my wife speak to E, an old student.
** She almost called to ask us to drive down to pick her up. Her husband beat her. =/. Fuck. 
** I cried as I listened, especially my wife talked about being 19 in Arizona. It made my offspring uncomfortable since I couldn't talk.
** She's currently with her parents. They are Trump fundies, while E is sane enough to doubt her faith and the existence of a God (I have no idea why Milligan allowed her to attend, but they didn't deserve her). So, she's not getting much support despite getting kicked (literally) to the ground. Offered to have her live with us, but she doesn't seem interested.
*** Standard responses of an emotionally abused wife from her. [[k0sh3k]] is exceptionally empathic and well-versed.
*** We have to keep offering. She has to find a way to escape. We are a safe place for her, fresh start. She's gotta be broken; I would be.
* Presentations on [[Gratitude]]
* Work on Contextlinks and Backlink global and local buttons. 
* My wife had another interesting conversation. Her first BF (8yo) is now a monk after being a capitalist pig. Interesting. 
** She sent him a rosary. 
* Dialectures
* Walk with wife
** Long one. =)
** Unfortunately, she got hit by a bicyclist who was on her phone. =/. She may need to see a doctor. We're not sure yet.
* [[vidya]]: offspring installed their pirated copies of [[Disco Elysium]]. We all played some.
* Offspring made dinner for us
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Tofu stir fry and wantons, delicious
** I finished my long-fucking presentation on [[Gratitude]]. 
*** Everyone was tired, so we didn't do [[h0p3ful Review]], but set up the machine for it later.
* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
* Sleep by 3?
