title: 2021.11.24 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Irrationally Negative

Woke at 6:30. Holy fuck. Slept so hard. I feel good. She's up, caught her right before she heads out. Hugs'n'bugs, following our standard dialogue scripts. There's an itch in her today, but can't put my finger on it. Prep for dinner.

//Skintime// with [[ASK]]. Allergies kicking in. [[TTTOTW]] + Salad + Pineapple + Reese's Pieces + Water + SC2 IEM Katowice 2021, skivviesless in blanket and fingerless gloves, ofc. SC2 ASUS ROG 2021. 

Dadnap. Woke at noon? //Skintime// with [[ASK]]. [[TTTOTW]]. Offspring came down to [[The Den]] to grind. [[Morning Routine]]. Cherry jam toast. [[ASK]] is baking focaccia, and someone is brining* the turkey. [[TTTOTW]]. SC2 KoB2. Feeling negative today now. Vapelyfe.

The Offspring came down to grind. 

Mi amor and I hit the library. Children's librarian said it was good to finally put a half-face to a name when she met my wife. Two women of the same height and occupation, 20 or so years apart, similar taste in YA perhaps. They walked through the transformations of the library this year. This is the first time I have been able to even see this section of the library, and it strongly reminds me of a hospital and the hypervigilant cleanliness I sometimes find in overgroomed, rules-heavy impoverished daycares. She feels like she didn't get enough done, and everything is due in January, and nobody seems to have information on the nature of the changes to the promotion process, and it turns out to be difficult to find outside writers during covid (which has mangled a lot), including what she'd normally find from people implementing her process (hard to find anyone with time). I'm not worried, but I can see the next 6 weeks are going to be quite stressful.

Shopping @ W-Entity with [[ASK]]. We ran all over the place looking for stuff, but it wasn't bad. Place was fairly cleaned out (they will be closing for T-Day, which brings me back to my childhood). Last minute shopping for stuff (though, we have two trained culinary artists in the house who can make do, should they want to). Saw William, nods and he patted me on the back as he walked with another. We saw him again later. Snot dripping from his nose, and he doesn't know it. I think he may be ill. He said he had a place to be on T-day. My timing in the conversation was especially poor, like any autist. [[ASK]] is the gap-filler and standard response provider, knows how to keep the conversation train moving smoothly. She's got that [[Matrix|The Matrix]]-style coat today, compliments (because it is cool).

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. Penis no work. My hypothesis is masturbation has relieved skinhunger, and now that I get so much skintime consistently throughout the day, I'm somehow not as horny (I'm not claiming it's rational). Maybe it will change again. Lots of changes in my life, good ones. 

[[Family Gathering]] was excellent. Focaccia, sketti with meatsauce, and veggie tray (unused, from the party). I had a glass of wine too. No longer keeping water down here because [[ASK]] detects it isn't clean enough (her ability to sense is often even stronger than [[k0sh3k]] and [[j3d1h]]; the boys are often blind retards by comparison, sometimes jelly sometimes not, ofc). I had two plates! //Skintime//, and then an episode of //The Office// as we see it fly completely off the rails. 

[[TTTOTW]]. [[ASK]] walked me through her emergency kits. She is prepared. //Skintime// + //One Piece// with [[ASK]]. Sleep by 10? Hit me like a truck. Spending more time meditation and sleeping than usual.
