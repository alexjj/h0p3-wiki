*** Low-hanging fruit anonymized identities with F2F moderation/salience signaling on fitting p2p distributions. You need the disassociation to make it safer to the say the truth, and you need the workers to own the means of production (including the construction of epistemic authorities, webs of trust based on real people's relationships at the bottom). To be clearer, frozen peaches is a limited space we build, practice with, and materially uphold correctly.

*** I wonder if [[Saint Hegel]] might even agree at The Absolute point. Seems to fit plenty of religious beliefs.

*** god tier - it's [[art]] even if you don't know why it's amazing - oddly enough, it makes me feel sad to know this was created, bittersweet (but, I mean, he's also the current dev)

*** Also: wat. This is insane, right? God bless these archivists. Doin' the lawd's work, surely. Reminds me of [[ASmith]]; his time to shine. Interesting to see a variety calling for archives of these "terrorists." I saw a particularly flawed, hypernormalized, and evil section of the proletariat begin to do something that almost resembled the right thing to do (if you squint), even if not well or for the right reasons (and I could not imagine the [[pleft]], especially PoCs, not dying for that). What did you see in the stunt? Are they claiming that this democratic election has been a sham? Yes. Are they wrong? Significantly, but they are correct to identity the lack of fair representation and picking out theater (even if they are on the stage possibly LARPing now). They don't understand the story well enough, but surely we can admire what is left of their integrity. 
**** Yeah, they are still wildly wrong, and, indeed, they may become much worse.

*** The studies of divinity and idealism continue to congeal.
*** Facts vs Things points is perhaps incompleteness...facts represent, syntactic by definition, things are the semantics. I'd probably kill myself too Wittgenstein (I need moar time).
*** Another fucking internalist. Kill me now plz.
