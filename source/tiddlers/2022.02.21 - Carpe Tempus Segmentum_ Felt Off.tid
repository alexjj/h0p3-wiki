<<<
//Skintime// with my sympaticon.

Pushed brix. Fireman Time! Made breakfast, eggs and toast.

//Skintime// with my sympaticon + //ATLA//.

[[TTTOTW]].

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. //Inform the Men!// Accidental triple crown. Yus.

[[TTTOTW]].

[[Family Time]] was simple. Vapelyfe. Plenty of discussion, including [[Unorthodox Savings]]. Everyone read and signed off on [[Variety Creepy]]'s letter. Eventually, I paced.

[[5c0ut]] made dinner (I didn't see Dev show up, but the car was parked on the lawn to make it so there was room for him). It was excellent. Cabbage-based som tam (true to the spirit, no doubt) and something between cow pot and pad kra pow. Delicious.

//Sherlock// + //Skintime// with mi amor. 

Think I slept for a bit, but my girls kept waking me up.

//Skintime// with my sympaticon. Meds for her. Put her to couch.

[[TTTOTW]].

A wild nomonies peeks...

[[Variety Creepy]] is typing...I [[hope]] he checks his [[@]]. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Water + pototo salad. 
<<<

Dark chocolate. [[TTTOTW]]. Sleep by 1:30?

Woke at 9? Long meditation. //Skintime// with my sympaticon. She made tea for me, and I made sourdough + butter + cream cheese (unfortunately, the combo does not work as well as I'd hoped). [[TTTOTW]].

A Flash.

[[TTTOTW]]. 

[[1uxb0x]] came down to grind. [[j3d1h]] remotely worked on [[Unorthodox Savings]] ideas with me, since she has some strong opinions about the matter that I should hear. Scheduling with all the adults for today, Wednesday, and Thursday. Weird week, official paperwork, passports, taxes, etc. My son is finishing what he started many months ago. [[TTTOTW]].

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. Her day was shit. Not convinced she wanted to be around anyone. My prediction is up.

[[5c0ut]] made dinner for Dev and the fam again. A salty, tomato-based lentil soup with rice. Thank you. 

[[Family Gathering]] had plenty of chatter and sniping (mostly just [[j3d1h]] and me throughout; the girl just doesn't know when she's lost an argument :P). Watched the Cuddy.narcissist doesn't really want to be a mom episode of //House//. 

Put mi amor to bed. Up to her eyeballs in Greek and her new GISHWHES boyband, //Voiceplay//, livestream. Today felt off for everyone, I think.

//Skintime// with my sympaticon + //ATLA//. Sleep by 9?
