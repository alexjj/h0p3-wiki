Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Noodles + fizzy drank + LolVod. Laundry and cleaning. [[TTTOTW]] + Footbath. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Oh, I found out, I'm almost at the half-way mark to filling up my [[Music: Library]]. Perhaps in a few years, I'll reach 10GB (and then, it will be a different monster I must fight).

She came down to do laundry (maybe 11?), and I beckoned her with my one-hand clap (I was asked what the fuck I was doing :P). Church was weird, layspeaker was beyond incompetent (offspring confused as well), but common prayer was solid. Inform the Men! Meditation. Shower of the gods! 

[[TTTOTW]]. Hrm. She has hives. I've been using the hypoallergenic stuff for my bed (but not my clothes). =/. A freeby flash, 'cause I'm staring up at her. Made lunch with her, noodles + shrooms + softboiled eggs (with extra no idea but it smells and tastes really soy-based Asian sauce [can't read it]). //The Office// and even some //Skintime//. Greedy AF. Dadnapped.

Woke at 4. Sex dreams with someone in her 50's, FTW. Felt her mouth with mine before I woke up. God damnit! Fireman Time! [[Morning Routine]].

[[Family Time]] had a rough start. Someone lied to me, and we specified what my daughter is facing yet again. This year is a big fucking deal. Her room for error is closing. She got angry, and I didn't have to defend myself this time (though she was asked to leave Discord to focus on [[Family Time]]...not sure how many years it's gonna take). In any case, it quickly got a lot better. Reading what the adults wrote left us with laughs and a lot of food for thought. It took several hours to get through mine this week. 

Shells'n'cheese + Tomato Soup! 

[[TTTOTW]]. Stair hugs. I want to spend all my life there. Cleaned the vape tank (sludge) with alcohol. Fireman Time!<<ref "t">> Footbath + Vodka + Pistachios + LolVod. LCS Championships. Absolute degenerate braincandy.

I'm drunk now (I don't feel it, but I know it counts as being drunk...3 fingers [not where they really belong]). I really like my footbath. I kinda want a bathtub in my room. Lmao. I'd have to get a pump though. Ugh. I would smell nicer. There are VERY important things to do in tubs (even though the heat is too much for me in that respect, but I'm sure I could overcome it). Can't justify it. I'm very happy to have footbaths with a plastic container on my concrete "sippin" and watching retards on my screen. This is luxury.

Someone discovered there were frozen burritos in the deep freezer. They proceeded to microwave three of them and then drown them in that salsa. They had wine to wash it down. That person is white trash, and they adore it. We should forgive them for their enormous sins. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Found and broke into my emergency dark chocolate supplies. Sleep by 5?

Woke at 11? It was enough. Meditation. Hugs'n'bugs. Assignments. A serious fucking encounter with my daughter. I am no fun to lock horns with. [[Morning Routine]]. Tons of cleaning. Pizza + Water. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. 

My offspring did not want to walk (already had their exercise outdoors, so...alright). Down to [[The Den]] for our time together. My daughter started a conversation about Alan Watts, so we rabbitholed. //Foundation// @ 6:28:15. Offspring worked on their projects. My daughter argued about how she often hates the act programming until it starts to work, and then she feels like a mad scientist (I T S A L I V E !). I'm glad she got some satisfaction today; she's cleaning it up now, making it purty to her eyes.

On the edge of dadnapping: she came home, just enough //Skintime// that we had to wait before we left. Fireman Time! (but of course).

Shopping @ Tarjay. Picked up the handful of things she needed (well, offspring needed, according to her :P). That place is expensive. Held hands, so I'm good. Her day has been busy AF, so many meetings. C actually believes in the spiritual value of near-death hallucinatory experiences at face value. S maintains her island, and A continues to build what I consider to be a real friendship. Her presentation got moved up from what she had predicted, but even her last minute sketch (she type fast yo) will be used as the rough draft for all the libraries. She's been thinking more about her DEI hiring process which hasn't been schedule-optimized. She's having to make explicit so many implicit processes lately.

Shopping @ Aldi for our meal. Prepared dinner with mi amor. The inability to eat anything with milk continues to rain on her parade. [[TTTOTW]].

Lightning Struck! Thinkin'.

Finished dinner up. [[Family Gathering]]. Fish, fries, potato salad (I'm always potating), peppers, mandarins, wine, and then cinnamon buns :P. We watched //Arrested Development//, and I got some //Skintime//. We had our dessert and talked. My daughter is trying to explain our wikis, mine in particular, to Butter(s). We can't seem to pick out any pages that are fit for him, and there's not a good way to [[TLDR]] it down. Plenty of mature content, and some of the gaps are tremendous. My daughter explained to me that she has to translate my grogginese to English and then English to his circumstances and then loop back, for each sentence. My son argued that it's simply unlikely without having been tutored in several topics. In any case, I'm still thinking about you, Butter(s)! =).

[[TTTOTW]], finishing my wine, and LolVod.
