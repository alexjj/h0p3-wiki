title: 2021.04.06 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Immediately Pull Out, Phone, Queue Up

Woke right at midnight. Holy fuck did I sleep hard. It was amazing. Broski chillaxin, I joined him. [[TTTOTW]]. Tea (pitcher was a good idea) and fruit. I've got water, wine, and tea lined up now. Minimizing reasons to get out of my seat like a true degenerate.

Continuing the vaccination hunt. Broski was able to get through the CDC's VAMS system fully `/jelly`. Still nothing available through our health provider (I could say I take care of children, which is true, but it's not the same thing). VAMS shows a single institution that might have an earliest date possible, but their site shows nothing is. Aight.

Local-[[FTO]] (seems incredibly unlikely that we'll reach escape velocity - beyond bland), LolVod+Leftovers, [[TTTOTW]].

Been finding multiple spiders in my room. Don't have the heart to kill them. Just stay off me, and we'll be okay, losers. 

Ranga came down for petting and crack. My floor is industrial and cold (I can even keep my own feet warm with socks and shoes), so I doubt he'll spend as much time with me given the much warmer options available. Also, catdoors have been working fine upstairs. It's getting warmer outside (flowers we've never planted started coming up, neat), and I need to get one set for the metal door to the outside. I really don't like the flimsiness of what I had before, and I need more tooling to get that door right (it's not flat, so I'm not sure how to deal with that well).

She slept like garbage, terrible nightmare. Lots of XOXOs.

Went to bed very late. Slept poorly, but I got so much yesterday that it's okay. Woke and ruminated, but saved up. [[TTTOTW]]. [[Scout]] came down for a moment. He'll be borrowing //Praxis// (as she dubbed it). 

Sat down with my daughter and read her school book to her from the beginning. Covered 15%. It's doable in just a few hours if she wanted. It doesn't take 50 days. Gonna keep demonstrating and destroying terrible lies. She was unhappy, of course. My son's discussion was simpler, but he had evidence. 

Listening to her meeting with A, //Skintime//, went over the day, she was wired then crashed. Held her as she slept. Nap was good, and I fell asleep too. For the first time, we just left our windows open, could hear the busy world around us. Inform the Men! Shower of the gods! She's got a based seminar to attend (I've only read one of the series, Southern Reach), and she's a natural for this (even the people leading it don't seem to know what she does). I'm hoping she'll be able to integrate further into the divinity school. It's where she belongs.

Assignments, cleaning, and git tooling.

[[Family Gathering]] with just me and the offspring. Nobody was hungry, but we had fun drafting. My deck is broken strong. All 3 of us went Bant. Draft and construction went quickly this time. Played a game with my son. Too much reaction and my bombs came out faster. He has great cards (made Bribery dope); never got hiw CoW+Strip online (such a strong combo that I basically have to hold an answer just for it). They played a game.

Nap in lap. 

Local-[[FTO]] continues to be a shitshow of people who can't read. I take myself to be awful at it in so many respects, so plenty of fault must be with me as well. Continue to check for appointments, no go. Heard back from Humboldt, and they say it's the core. Uh, huh. `/sigh`.
