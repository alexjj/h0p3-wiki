[10:21:41] h0p3: Hey, I rarely see you on Tox these days. Been about a year. How's life going for ya?
[10:22:05] 1010010: hello, I'm ok thanks
[10:22:07] 1010010: yourself?
[10:22:34] h0p3: I cannot complain. Living in my basement like a hiki, earning muh good boy points. 
[10:22:52] 1010010: awesome :)
[10:23:30] h0p3: I'm looking for my next dopamine hit. Got any links? I'm an absolute slut for links.
[10:24:49] 1010010: I'm watching How To Become a Tyrant
[10:25:03] 1010010: it's a netflix series that I got from piratebay
[10:26:04] h0p3: Starting it now. Gracias. 
[10:26:43] h0p3: Tyrion's voice is smooth.
[10:27:03] 1010010: kek, I was never a fan of that show
[10:27:18] h0p3: What went all wrong about it for ya?
[10:27:33] 1010010: it was the setting and the characters
[10:27:37] 1010010: just didn't appeal to me
[10:27:43] 1010010: very drab, dour and bleak
[10:27:47] h0p3: What kinds of show hit your top 10?
[10:27:58] h0p3: Lmao. You're watching "How To Become a Tyrant"
[10:28:07] h0p3: Seems like drab, dour, and bleak are non-trivial possibilities.
[10:28:25] 1010010: nah, this shit is entertaining and even amusing times
[10:28:30] h0p3: Lawd. That is dark.
[10:28:35] 1010010: :D
[10:28:42] 1010010: anyway, fav shows
[10:28:56] 1010010: the wire, sopranos, curb your enthusiasm
[10:29:02] 1010010: engrenages
[10:29:27] h0p3: Aint never heard of that one. Grabbing that now too.
[10:29:37] 1010010: engrenages is a french show
[10:30:01] 1010010: so make sure you get the subtitles pack if you don't speak french
[10:30:11] h0p3: Aye. I'm an amerimutt. I can barely even English. 
[10:30:31] h0p3: (I did try to learn other languages. I'm just retarded.)
[10:30:39] 1010010: meh
[10:31:33] h0p3: So, how do you survive in the world? 
[10:36:11] 1010010: I sell myself :p
[10:36:27] h0p3: You absolute whore! XD.
[10:36:32] 1010010: sadly yes
[10:36:55] h0p3: Do you enjoy any parts of your labor?
[10:37:17] 1010010: it's not to taxing much of the time 
[10:37:28] 1010010: it's just managing people and their strange habits
[10:37:33] 1010010: for the most part
[10:38:39] h0p3: I can see why you are watching Tyrion's Tyrant show so carefully now. That makes sense. 
[10:39:06] 1010010: apparently I've got much of this shit down already 
[10:39:13] h0p3: `/high-5`
