title: 2020.10.02 - Wiki Review: Curling Up More

* [[2020.10.01 - Prompted Introspection: Recovering]]
** That is a Joker-y question to me as well. Each Presidential Election cycle seems to become more emotionally expensive for me. It had some good things too though. I also left academia, and I've curled up more.

** It's not like I've not tried for it. This time around though, there's more incentive. We'd get to keep the products of our labor.

** Think I continue to drift away from everything. Sounds like depression. Self-imposed to some extent. I'm tired too. I have no idea how [[k0sh3k]] does it.

** You'd like to see a lot of things done. It was a narrow window today.

** Still doing a terrible job of letting go, lol. Okay.
* [[2020.09 - TDL]]
** I am glad I let go of the process. It still may come back one day, but I'm not in need of it. That's a privileged position.

** I am still questioning the need for [[Monthly Audit]]s on the older processes. I don't know what more I can extract at this level. I think building other kinds of molecules makes more sense.  
* [[2020.09 - Link Log]]
** I was clogged up there for a long while. This one is also on the chopping block for [[Monthly Auditable]]s. 
* [[2020.09 - Family Log]]
** Here's an example of one that keeps evolving and requires [[Audit]]ing, especially in virtue of [[FTO]] and being a [[Root User]].
*** There's an argument to made that the yearly level requires more here.
* [[2020.09 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum]]
** I will continue to argue that my personal life is improving.
