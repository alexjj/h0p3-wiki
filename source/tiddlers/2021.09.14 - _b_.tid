[[Arrogance]] is a non-trivial problem, of that we all know in our finger-pointing. I suppose I must defend stances, methods, and processes sometimes accused of being dogmatic. Sometimes the word "dogma" is a special rhetorical swearword, a borderline thought-terminator, and a way to repaint magnanimity as hubris. We can attempt to shift the burden of proof or the necessity of pulling our weight in the dialectic by simply dismissing our opponents instead; it's a really cheap way to lack integrity. Those who deny that we can present or use a subjective interpretation of a state of affairs to progressively represent the objective truth are outright denying the ability to meaningfully access objectivity. Game over, hypocrite. Dogmatism^^tm^^ may be in virtue of claiming that one's opinion is the source of truth, which, of course, suffers from solipsistic problems, but this may be a straw man (I'll agree that all instances of unjustified dogmatism commit this prideful crime against Humanity). Dogmatism is a failure to be open to doubting one's beliefs, but that does not imply one cannot justifiably hold a belief through any amount of evidence or argumentation (virtue and expertise eventually raise probabilities of some beliefs to be so high that they won't be overturned, even when sufficiently questioned), and then it becomes a matter of judging [[the other]]'s intentions (strawman ad hominem abound). To accuse someone of being dogmatic for pointing to external sources for justification have already denied the possibility of objectivity as well. Talk about hubris! Further, there are contexts in which an agent is justified in withdrawing an item from some domains of dispute, particularly when there are skin in the game asymmetries and while facing bad [[faith]] actors (the problem continues). There are cases in which only some people have the right to force you to question (and especially repeatedly question) your belief. Of course, there are also some beliefs that should be inspected (or even defended) in all contexts, which is not to say we must necessarily maintain said beliefs. I'm often suspicious of those who accuse others of dogmatism of themselves begging an underlying denial of any even approximately accessible criterion of authority; their goal tends to be framing the dialectic to deny even the possibility of justification in the end (and, hence, they do not get to help themselves to method either). No research programme escapes {[[axiomatic|Axioms]]} reasoning. There does come a point where we stop giving reasons {[[Axioms]]}, at least temporarily, though how to draw that line suffers at least the trilemma (and, I strongly suggest biting the [[infinigress]]ive bullet, including the problems of qualia and the necessary contradiction of speaking of the ineffable). Fundamental disagreement may sometimes boil down to "the other side is dogmatic and refuses to listen to my obviously superior set of axioms," but not necessarily. I intend for every person who wields that word "dogma" to be subject to scrutiny for hypocrisy; smells like projection to me. I'll agree that taking offense and tone-policing can be a form of unjustified political behavior, but they aren't necessarily. Dogmatism as arguing as an end in itself, seeking to win merely for the sake of winning or pride, boils down to engaging in dialectics for the wrong reasons. Ideally, participants in dialogue are winners in just finding truth, even when their arguments are shown to be false (a better approximation of the truth or even truth emerges). In practice, however, there are cases in which failures to be rational require escalation into violence, and there are arguments whose material consequences are winner take all. Some arguments are zero sum because their outcomes are for all the marbles, and not merely as a matter of persuasion. Merely eliminating spurious beliefs isn't always sufficient for meeting our obligations in dialectics. So, what does it mean to listen to one's enemies, opponents, detractors, or even more neutrally, one's interlocutor's with fitting charity? These too are all subject to the same root problems.
