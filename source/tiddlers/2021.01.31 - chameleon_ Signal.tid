[11:21 PM] chameleon:
God is the ocean and we are the waves
there's an analogy to moksha that's like that. usually accompanied by a picture like this

[6:32 AM] h0p3: I love you! =). Signal is always up for me. Your SMS appears blocked.

[7:16 AM] h0p3: Madame Senpai, I love you. It's been too long since I've said it. I beg you for Signal (or similar) again (I've got a mumble server, if you wanted to VC over that instead [I MISS YOUR VOICE; I'm tempted to just call you up, lol {and, you should feel free to do so whenever you want for whatever, day or night}]). I want to thank you for your kind words. You made me laugh hard in a place where I really needed it. Don't worry: I aint gonna die on ya. :P. After all, we still need to play magic and drink beer together, in-person, Senpai (so, like, you better fucking not die on me either, soldier!). I need to insulate the attic, but hopefully we'll have a roomy and comfortable place for yall to stay with us (for as long as you'd like); otherwise, you'll take my room.  Forgive me for being quiet; the [[Pause]] is a necessary space for another person I also love all the way down no matter what. I will add that I recently started writing in it again, quietly, without TW-timestamps (and, I ask you to keep that fact to yourself, please). Funny to read from diffs in [[Family Time]], lol.
[8:35 AM] chameleon: Yeah I miss you too much to not install a silly app lol. Here's my signal

[8:35 AM] chameleon: You can shoot me mumble details there or here.

bugging you while you at work, ignore me at will, please. =)
Jan 26 9:23am
Busy day today, maybe chat later `^^`
Jan 26 11:53am
`/hug`. Yes, ma'am. And, if not today, whenever. We got time.

Root User, Madame, Senpai: [[Sphygmus]] has brought to my attention something crucial. I'm an idiot. I know you don't use substances. There is one you may need to try one day, if all else fails. It is the only sledgehammer that has ever brought me out of depression on the spot (it only lasts for a week, but it gives time to organize life). Ketamine. Look it up. I will send you some immediately, quietly.

I don't think I should be taking things
Jan 31 9:33am
I'll get in huge trouble if I'm caught
Jan 31 9:34am
It's okay. You don't have to. This is a back up plan, one that you can study privately. I only ask you to take this if you were ever unable to escape the pit, if you needed an answer as a last resort.
Jan 31 9:35am
I can hide it. And, we are using tool I trust. You will pass the major X-panel drug tests with it. This is not a benzo, not cannabis, not an opioid. This is a different substance.
Jan 31 9:37am
Idk. Still don't think I should ;;
Jan 31 9:45am
t's okay. No pressure. Keep this in your back pocket.
Jan 31 9:46am
I'm here to think and feel with you either way. I just don't want you to feel trapped in a cage. You have options. You have people who love you.
Jan 31 9:47am
*hugs*
Jan 31 9:47am
Thank you ‚ù§
Jan 31 9:47am
`/tears`, I love you. *hug*
