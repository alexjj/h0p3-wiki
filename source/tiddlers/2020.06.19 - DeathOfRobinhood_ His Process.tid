How's your week been?
Jun 19 1:58pm
Hey. Pretty good. Dying in the heat.

 I attempted a group chat with the other animators to rally their enthusiasm and muster some love for the craft. I think it was awkward...
Jun 19 2:08pm
lol =)
Jun 19 2:08pm
Bask in it!
Jun 19 2:08pm
Yesterday, took a walk with this guy I became acquainted with last year.
Jun 19 2:08pm
Ex-microsoft. Says he was a libertarian -> anarcho-capitalist
Jun 19 2:09pm
Became a Christian Ã  few years ago. Still believes in libertarian principles but abandoned it as a project for its lack of moral foundation.
Jun 19 2:09pm
Still holds to a lot of American right talking points, but is a sweet guy.
Jun 19 2:11pm
I think you might not like him, he mentioned interest in this book where the author tries to prove free markets from the bible
Jun 19 2:11pm
ha, yeah, probably not, lol.
Jun 19 2:12pm
I bet we would still have plenty to talk about. I think there's something to be said for the horseshoe theory. There are parts of the analysis in which the Libertarian understands better than almost anyone else what it means to attempt to convert moral principles into material structures and clusters of legal rights. I admire how seriously they aim to reason about the notion that they own themselves as a person.
Jun 19 2:13pm
I plead ignorance and intellectual cowardice. I took a train to new York when I was a teen, and randomly took out a library book for the trip: the memoirs of Ayn Rand, not knowing who she was. This cool, older girl on the train told me I'm not supposed to like her, and I haven't looked back since
Jun 19 2:17pm
At least until Jordan Peterson started referring all of his concepts back to cartoons.
Jun 19 2:18pm
lol
Jun 19 2:18pm
I am surprised that the other animators aren't interested in talking shop, btw. Why wouldn't they be interested? Here's this rare craft that tells stories that any person with eyes (even non-humans can understand parts of animation, I believe) can appreciate; don't they want to understand it more and explore it?
Jun 19 2:21pm
I failed at framing the discussion right
Jun 19 2:21pm
And was held back by the anti-enthusiasm of one guy in particular who's been poisoned by the Assembly line model of modern cartoon production
Jun 19 2:22pm
But no, mostly, I couldn't drum it up
Jun 19 2:22pm
It doesn't help that I'm mandated to uphold a notion of budgetary adherence that I spit on regularly
Jun 19 2:23pm
lol
Jun 19 2:23pm
On average, how much does each second of animation cost currently? If there were a butterzone, what should it cost?
Jun 19 2:24pm
[[REDACTED]]
Redact please
Jun 19 2:27pm
done
Jun 19 2:27pm
These are a couple of videos highlighting my process
Jun 19 2:28pm
And why I believe quality specific animation is not incompatible with efficiency
Jun 19 2:28pm
Animators are expected to produce on average 35 seconds a week (on our project)
Jun 19 2:28pm
You are ridiculously fast at this, lol.
Jun 19 2:34pm
It reminds me of this person: https://vimeo.com/93218648
Jun 19 2:34pm
but more intentional
Jun 19 2:34pm
Where are both your hands when you do this?
Jun 19 2:36pm
Do you all have a giant library of canonical images for this show?
Jun 19 2:38pm
One hand holds my pen, the other on a device with all my hotkeys
Jun 19 2:38pm
what device?
Jun 19 2:38pm
Image attached to message
Jun 19 2:39pm
The rigs have a small selection of hands and mouths and things, but they're quite limited (and not all that well drawn), so I insist on animators draw as much of their original content as they can
Jun 19 2:39pm
So, no, no library
Jun 19 2:40pm
Do you set up significant automation/routines/macros from that remote?
Jun 19 2:42pm
It reminds me of the Nostromo n52 gamepads (combined with AHK, super cool).
Jun 19 2:43pm
No, no such advanced options
Jun 19 3:03pm
I think you posted a class for [[j3d1h]] about using Python to automate stuff last week that I wanted to follow up on
Jun 19 3:04pm
I don't know anything about your ecosystem, but some of the professional artist tooling has a preferred scripting language embedded inside it. Regardless of that, Python seems to give you a cool layer underneath, especially for connecting different tools.
Jun 19 3:08pm
Python speaks a lot of languages.
Jun 19 3:09pm
Can Python give me time to study Python?
Jun 19 3:17pm
No. It is a black hole. Like Linux, it is only free if your time has no value.
Jun 19 3:17pm
XD
