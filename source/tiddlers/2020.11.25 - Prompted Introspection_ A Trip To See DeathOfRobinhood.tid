title: 2020.11.25 - Prompted Introspection: A Trip To See DeathOfRobinhood

!! Where would you like to go on a day trip? You must drive there and back in one day, but you have unlimited funds for gas, food, and activities.

Lady Melisandre, you have given me unlimited funds. I would buy the world and give it back to the poor in the pursuit of [[Justice]]. As you know, I'm tired of yet another line of this questioning. If you don't put a ceiling on the resource, I wouldn't spend it on myself. If I must spend it on myself, I don't see why I would travel. If I must travel, and I must spend it on myself, I would buy things that would be useful long-term. That is not the spirit of this question at all. It's about hedonic pleasure and immediate experience. Sure, there are plenty of things I would enjoy, but you are asking me to {[[dream]]} about something almost irrelevant to my context. I have very little respect for this question; I'm not convinced it is moral. The spirit of the question is missing the point of why I live. 

Alright, setting aside the obvious, I'll take another stab at it. There are so many experiences I'd like my offspring to have. That would dictate our trips. I have no idea what single nearly costless day trip would be best for them. Currently, CV19 is kicking our asses, so I would be even harder pressed to answer if the trip would happen soon (we are barred from traveling in many respects at the moment). There's also a difference between what I think my offspring should experience if they were going to do their best to interpret and work through the event and what they should experience given my predictions of their minds and behaviors. I don't have a clean answer for you, Lady Melisandre.

We're fairly close to [[DeathOfRobinhood]]. My offspring do not remember what it is like to be in places where English is not the primary language. They have very little experience visiting other nations (same for me really). It'd be cool AF for my [[Root Users]] to meet in-person, and I owe the man several hugs.
