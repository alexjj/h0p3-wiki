title: 2021.01.05 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: A New Day

* Try To Take Over The World
* Fireman Time!
* Chilled with wife. 
** She's not sleeping enough. Hard to get back into the groove. Her natural sleep schedule is nightowl like mine. 
* Sleep by 8
* Woke at 3
* Ruminated.
* [[Morning Routine]], extra slow
* Gave no room for a story, just asked if they felt they used their time wisely, yes or no. 
** Generally, if you will not tell a sufficiently honest (and complete) story, it is better not to tell me a story. Let's not turn one problem into two except when dividing to conquer or justifiably attempting to deceive. 
** I hope they will be honest with themselves too. [[Know Thyself]].
** Everyone was in a better mood. New day. 
* ⁸Δ⁸
* Pumping air in tires and starting a stick with my son.
* //The Walk//
** Found out how to extend our current path. She hates exercise as much as she [[like]]s to [[read|Deep Reading]]. Walking with me is [[love]]. Worth torturing herself to speak with me and hold my hand. 
** I like that my walk with her has been one of the first things I do when I exit the hikicave. Brightens my day even when I wake up as the sun is coming down.
* //Skintime//, sweet baby jesus
* Try To Take Over The World
* Finished making dinner
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Tendies, fries, peas, coffee
** Lots of discussion today. I'm [[grateful]]. There are comforting silences in the world, but I think the discomforting silences can be an agony. 
*** y do u think i write so much, jon snow?
** [[MTG]]
*** Daughter's Affinity -1, 0, +1 vs Ghetto Merfolk: drop lords and win while she clampcycles into nothing; drop fish, daze, and reejery combo out the game (unfortunately, I screwed up my math, and I could have won a turn earlier if I had been more aggressive); big dick plated thopters rape me before I drop a single lord.
* Fireman Time!
* Got my pecker wet then considered water carbonation. 
** `/finger-taps-temple` - good thankin'
** Cuts right through my mouthbreathing phlegm, destroys the ronas, and other such miracles. 
** Long-term, it is the cheapest option. Split the water-out, maybe prevent backflow, but chilling it is the hard part. DIY is the only way to afford it.
* Hugged everyone. My wife does not want to sleep. I know. 
* Try To Take Over The World
** [[cried a lot|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrLPV_a3Uq4]]
** I hate silence so often. That doesn't mean I'm not thinking about the people I [[love]]. Far from it. Few would know the hours I spend thinking about them. I so rarely know the most fitting thing to say or do. 3 F's are really 4: Freeze. Sounds like a broken computer to me.
