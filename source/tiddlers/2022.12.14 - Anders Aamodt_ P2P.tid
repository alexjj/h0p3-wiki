If an AI can successfully simulate good content for this subreddit, go for it. Chat GPT is a more flexible thinker than some, but not others. And yes we should all be exiting to p2p networks made up of persons we know asap. Decentralized DNS is a real problem.

Hey there, [[Anders Aamodt]]. I'll keep it brief because you're a busy man doing [[good]] work.

I think we're in agreement on the DNS problem. Because there is nothing that really works well, I'm currently working with [[fourmyle57]] on a proper [[DHT|Outopos: DHT]] (I do not predict success). Vaporware or maybe a decade or two from now I'll have something. If you know anyone else suited to the task (and, I think even an expert needs years to build this correctly), please let me know.

Might not be saying anything new at all to ya. Living on the wire, I've some experience engaging in [[hyperconversations]] from site-to-site in the open on the web (mostly [[Indieweb]]™ sorts of folks), e.g. [[Sphygmus]], [[kickscondor]], [[MJos]], [[chameleon]], etc. In some ways, it's just a convention. It can be done without much automation (site push/pull or syncing, and notifications, e.g. [[Update Scanner|https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/update-scanner/]] or [[RSS|https://fraidyc.at/]]), even real-time (though my ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 is set to 2-minute updates instead of 1). Best mutable torrent option is still [[Resilio Sync]] (works within Whonix too). It's workable with minor elbow grease. People don't value it enough. It's not convenient, lacks network effect, and discovery + receiving attention are simply too valued by the average creator.

[[MuWire]] is dead. [[DarkMX]] and [[Aether]] are probably the best multi-user tools I've got at the moment. If you have any you want me to join, you let me know. I'm happy to follow you. [[The Motte|https://www.themotte.org/]] recently attempted to transition. Do you [[aim]] for that with SotS?
