title: 2020.06.23 - Prompted Introspection: Sir Greg Schufreider

!! Who is one of the most interesting people you have ever met?

Despite my criticism of the question in [[2019.05.03 - Prompted Introspection: Most Interesting Person in My World]], I'm not sure how to ask it more precisely yet. 

Sir Greg Schufreider is a fascinating human to me. He's excellent at providing a doorway into Continental philosophy for Analytic philosophers without suffering the flaws of critical theory I find in other humanities. As Father Time, his mighty Moses-beard is delightful (he fluffs it as he speaks), and he makes his tea in the classroom. He's got a special pose in the dialectic where he knows he's not on solid ground (e.g. moral philosophy) that allows the student to run with it. He watches his students and learns from them; it's clear that he's built his systematic philosophy through years of attention. Even on the question of Heideggerian Idealism, at least in person and especially in a classroom, he plays with his cards close to the vest. There's a kind of humility in his approach that I respect, and he is a generous grader (though, perhaps his feedback is deliberately inscrutable). For a person as sharply forthcoming and aggressive as I am in the dialectic, he provides a welcome calmness and flexibility.
