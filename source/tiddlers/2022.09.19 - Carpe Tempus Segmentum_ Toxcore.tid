Sleep at unknown time.

Woke at Noon? Diphenhydramine dreams.

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. //Inform the Men!//

Back to sleep at 2. Woke at 3:45. Felt like I slept lifetimes. 

//Skintime// with my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]].

[[Family Time]]. Thinking about the [[letter]] to [[chameleon]]. Lots to read this week. [[Lauraceae]] is in trouble, not in a healthy position, and I can reach her tonight, but I have no where to take her. She is too allergic to cats.

A rambutan. //The Sandman//. 

//The Walk// with my sympaticon. 

Chocolate Ice Cream. LolVod Highlights. Cleaned my legs, and the hot water is glorious. [[TTTOTW]]

[[TTTOTW]]. Chat with [[bready]]. Bandages, Kapow bread, and //Steven Universe// with my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]]. Sleep by 2:30?

Woke at 11? Gumpination. //Skintime// with my sympaticon. 

Chat with [[That's for you to decide]]. Someone is interested in DHTs now! Dope. I may be useful here. Grilled cheese with my sympaticon.

Took [[j3d1h]] out driving. More traffic today. Surprising number of topics related to driving worth covering, and I'd say 20% of it is [[Phenomenology]] (I did not predict that). She did well.

[[JRE]] called to confess of the hilarity of throwing banana peels like Mariokart and pissing in public trashcans. It makes good sense to me that one would be use the sink to pee though! There are some cases where that is the best option. Spending time with [[Q]] and [[Bn]] picking up vocabulary through games and books. [[Project Ascension]] is only in TBC, so no Death Knight, and he may not be feeling motivated to do all the legwork and configuration (which is considerable, no doubt, as it can feel like one is building 5 unique classes all at once alongside all the other automations and UI construction).

A wild [[gREEN]] appears...A groupchat.

Offspring came down to grind. Enjoying solving problems with [[1uxb0x]]. It has taken a long time to get to a place where he knows he doesn't know and hunts for the answer. 

Mi amor came down to watch HB. We got halfway through, but talked too much. noice. Clarinet.

[[Family Gathering]] was delicious. We had pizza, marinara sauce, and water. //House of Cards//.

Finished HB class with mi amor. We've profound disagreements with Baden throughout. I can't remember anything we talked about though (she can't either). I should take notes, but middle of talking with Toxcore folks at the same time. 

//The Walk// with my sympaticon. 

Put mi amor to bed. Cleaning my wound, bandages. //Steven Universe//. Truckin' through it. Surely, it will eventually demonstrate itself to be worthwhile. [[ASK]] and [[j3d1h]] say I've been gravely mistaken to have passed over the one. Mmmhmmm. Riight. =D. //Skintime// with my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]].
