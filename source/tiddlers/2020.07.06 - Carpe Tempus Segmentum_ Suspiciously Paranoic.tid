title: 2020.07.06 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Suspiciously Paranoic

* Woke at noon
** Grogg, could have gone for another hour, but scouting had been completed.
* [[Morning Routine]]
** Cold turkey. Let's keep it up (sadly).
* Fort Zuerst
** My daughter took me through their initial picks on foot. They did good work in the morning.
*** We agreed that they were too easy to find.
** We spent more time in that area blazing deeper (swampy bush sucks). We ended up finding a couple abandoned homeless encampments. I'm happy to share with these, but we decided the area was still too obvious and the amount of broken glass makes me uneasy (didn't find any needles though, so not bad).
** Went back home to regroup. We were going to try the otherside to see if we could find anything better.
*** Otw, my daughter just pulled up maps (hrm, yes. That does sound like a good idea...) and we decided that there was a forested area with enough size that the center of it would be great. She navigated us to the closest edge (I drove). It's right on the trail too (past the point I've ever been though). Wandered the edge to find a way into the forest, and we saw it hit the trail quickly. 
** We found our way to the trail and considered the gorgeous area. Deeper, quieter, running water, fewer people, seems unlikely to be developed within the city, and it smells good. We were not the first people to think of this though. My son found a hidden trail, and we followed it. Tarps, rope, hoses, and two fancy iron structures rusting over (people had partied here); it doesn't look like anyone has used it in a while. Also, we were able to find the edges with buildings nearby too. We kept moving.
*** Found a dead rat floating in a kitty litter bucket. Y u m m y. There's our new camp marker and first seat! =)
** We found our spot, mapped it and marked it. We'll be in a position to scavenge yet out of the way enough that it will be less likely to be found.
** My offspring navigated us to the nearest source of water, and interestingly, it was a B-line to our car (or my daughter's quiet machinations). 
*** We traced the edges of a barbed wire fence and briars looking for the way out of the forest. 
** Well, we found a spot, though it isn't clear the best way to get there (nor how we should move supplies). 
*** The construction yard/factory area we parked in won't work; they lock the gates after 4:30 (only one camera though).
* Showered
* Off to run errands with my wife
** My wife is annoyed and stressed. S is being a...contradicting himself oddly. VP appears to be charitable here. Still, doesn't feel right. I worry liability is being shifted (thank Lawd Rao). 
*** SZ will interpret and run defense, I hope.
*** Still wondering how much of higher-ed's approach to Fall is a bait'n'switch ("of course we will be open, give me your money")
** She forgot her beads for the return, =(, but we still got a slice. =)
** W-Entity
*** Bought missing supplies, butter, boots for my daughter, and we wandered
*** I saw Gunmetal Kathy again. =)
*** So many tits out today. 
* Read
* Offspring were supposed to gather supplies and complete their wikis...I am, of course, absolutely certain this was accomplished.
* Fell asleep in my wife's lap
** Deep dreams. Telic. On Topic. That is my sign, like any video game embedded into me.
* Woke at 11:30
** Sent folks to bed.
* //ATLA//
** Fire Book is best book? 
*** I eventually like almost all the characters, and I want to bang so many of them (hiyas, momo!).
*** Power-level inflation. It's not coherent, but that's okay. I enjoy it. For the record: Earth-bending is clearly the most powerful on average from the energy requirements alone (though dat blood-bending seems broken strong).
** Nobody ever really fucking dies.
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 4
