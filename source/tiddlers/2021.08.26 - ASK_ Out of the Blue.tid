Hey there. I speak with people as a vocation. You said hello to everyone about a month ago ([[REDACTED]]), and nobody said hello back. Hi. My name is h0p3. I'd like to be friends, and I'd like to know your stories too. Some victims can only tell their stories in fragments, and I'd do my best to give you some tools to piece it together. I'm an open book (seriously) like no one you've ever met (a madman out here in the desert). Please take your time before you choose to reply (if you do at all). I scare many people away, and I want you to have a chance to look around and inside who I am before you respond.

I hope you like to read and write. That's what I do with [[others]] (https://philosopher.life/#Find%20The%20Others).

Like you, I also have a "random thoughts with no home" place: https://philosopher.life/#%2Fb%2F.

If you'd want to make your own Tiddlywiki, I can help you with that. I have many family and friends that join me in this practice. My wife (https://bookwyrm.quest), my daughter (https://theta.wiki), my son (I can't point you to his because he hasn't given me permission), and other close friends, like [[chameleon]] (https://wiki.waifu.haus) and [[Sphygmus]] (https://sphygm.us).

If you choose to [[contact]] me outside of Reddit, please anonymize yourself. https://protonmail.com/ is an excellent, highly respected service (that's what I use for my online identity).

I'm an autistic person with Geschwind Syndrome. I write a lot (and read way more). https://philosopher.life/#Timelines

We likely have quite a bit in common. Most people who connect with me have been burned alive.

I'll read every word you write, but you need not do the same for me (that may be simply infeasible).
