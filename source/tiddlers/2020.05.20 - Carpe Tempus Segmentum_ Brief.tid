title: 2020.05.20 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Brief

* Woke at 10
* Listened to my family and meditated.
** We are lucky to hear my wife do her work. She's profoundly skilled. 
* Dialectures
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Read+Write
* Offspring complain that I'm sagging. 
** Lol. 
* TW Canvassing
* Dialectures
* [[vidyas]]: Just straight tiktok today. We reveled in it.
* Nap
** Hit me like a truck. Shit for sleep.
* Vapelyfe
* My wife offered to walk extra tomorrow and let me just think.
** I needed to think. She is ever generous to me.
* Walk+Talk
* Thinking about the letter to [[BL]] with my wife.
* Read+Write
* Made deli sandwiches for dinner!
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Talked about my wife's work.  
** [[h0p3ful Review]]: My son came around to sit with me to watch my screen while we worked together. That boy gets it. 
* Worked on Contextlinks with my daughter.
** I still don't get what people love about Roam here. Like, if you have a small wiki, fine. Backlinks, however, are completely fucking hilarious on my wiki. You can't have a reasonable story river because it is completely flooded. 
** However, I now see something that I was missing before. Part of the issues is that I need functional links for providing context, particularly in engaging in (and embedding the display of) search processes on behalf of my interlocutor.
* A serious chat with [[DeathOfRobinhood]]. 
** We are back to the disagreement. Again and again, he is kind to me.
* My offspring went to bed instead of waiting for presentation on [[Gratitude]]. Good. Tomorrow, immediately.
* Installing the game recommended.
** I'm excited to report back to my brothers [[JRE]] and [[K]] about it too. 
* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
* Sleep by 2:45?
