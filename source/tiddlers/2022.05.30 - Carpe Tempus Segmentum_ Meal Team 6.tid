Watermelon! [[TTTOTW]], Massage. Food and //Top Chef//. Sleep by 3?

Woke at 11? Solid. Meditation. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

Shoptalk with my sympaticon as she works on her machine. 

[[TTTOTW]],

//The Walk// with mi amor. Cream cheese toast. Quiet, long route. Saw Tex, who very clearly distinguished his own child from his fosters, whom I shall refer to as Joy and Malachi (to the point that he regulated how his own ran along the streets but not his foster children). Kids were great. 

Hard Dadnap. It's a day of rest, no doubt.

Chatting with [[Anders Aamodt]]. I wonder if some people confuse my politeness or gentleness^^tm^^ with my ability to enjoy being with most people. It is rare that I am with someone that I would choose to be with if I didn't find it my obligation. I don't think they have much to offer me, but that's not why I'm there. Still, even with full shields up, I'm [[lucky]] to have as many pleasant or even joyful encounters as I do.

[[Family Time]] @ 5:45. Very late, but we don't require 5-6 hours anymore (in part because there's nothing more I'm going to argue). Pleasant with several dialectics to boot.

A Flash.

Pizza and //Everything Everywhere All At Once//. `/nod`. Don't let the first 1.5 hours fool you. Worth it. Amazing. Wept for the last 20 minutes.

//Top Chef// with [[ASK]] & [[j3d1h]]. I am [[lucky]] to hear there perspectives on this work I've seen many times.

People getting shoveled. Planning with mi amor. Cleaning the basement with my sympaticon.

//The Walk// with my sympaticon. Ended up not needing the dolly. Quiet, enjoying the evening.

[[TTTOTW]]. LolVods, MSI. Highlights until finals, ofc. Sleep by 2 or 3?

Woke at 10ish? //Skintime// with my sympaticon.

Shopping @ W-Entity with mi amor to pick up some stuff for the picnic. Dialectics with mi amor.

Four traveled to see //The Tower//. Several miles of hiking, and folks took their turns engaging in dialectics with me. Some deep questions from my daughter. It was fascinating to be so high we could see the city from many, many miles away. Some very well-dressed lasses. We ate sammiches, watermelon, and chips. A little kid was on their own on the trail, but they were alright; family was behind on the curve. 

//Skintime// with my sympaticon. She exists, and I am [[grateful]].

Dadnap. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

[[Family Gathering]] was delicious. [[ASK]] prepared the red and white bake. Cheese was perfect on it. The Renovated Office Window Into Watson's Room episode of //House//.

//Skintime// with my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]].

An excellent evening with my daughter, one the best I can recall. She was doing the kitchen without her brother (he's not feeling well), and with cuts on her hand, asked for help washing. Dope. We spent much longer than we had to. Dialectics, hard and delightful, about what matters most. {{Text Art: 𝕱𝕴𝕽𝕰🔥}}. Her philosophy of [[art]] continues to grow. We continued the conversation of our walk earlier as well. Easily integrated.
