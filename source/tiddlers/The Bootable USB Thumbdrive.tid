title: The Bootable USB Thumbdrive

//Dedicated to [[The Ultimate USB]] (one day, homie!). To rule them all, of course. A [[Leet]] Swiss Army Knife for the Sneakernet. This is a tool I'd love to see in the hands of every kid on the planet. It's cheap, recyclable, customizable, FLOSSy piratical, and deeply concerned with owning the means of production while leveraging the brilliance of so many minds (not me, I'm the skiddie, always).//<<ref "df">>

!! [[Ventoy|https://www.ventoy.net/]]:

I've a sad history<<ref "s">> of having to write over USBs all the time to make bootable shit. In my limited experience, multi-boot USB devices are a pain in the ass,<<ref "m">> and, much like my [[micropenis]], I've never had big thumb drives (for a while, I preferred 2.5" externals). Prices have dropped since I last bought one, and Ventoy is outstanding: good enough to buy a [[USB-C + USB 3.1 64GB|https://www.ventoy.net/]] Thumbdrive for twelfitty.<<ref "f">> I think it's time to clear out my hollowed George Orwell graphography book to only hold gold again, like this thumb drive.<<ref "rb">> Not much outside x86/64 for now, and I don't anticipate needing any ancient voodoo. Aside from electricity concerns, perhaps this counts as a real post-apocalypse tool, as you can often walk up to a machine even without a network and make it work with this.
