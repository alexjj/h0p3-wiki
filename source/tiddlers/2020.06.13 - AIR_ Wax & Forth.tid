"""
[10:23 AM] h0p3: How's it going, sir?
[6:22 PM] ScoutsAnthem: Ehh. How about you?
[6:22 PM] h0p3: I'm grinding. Ups and downs today, but overall good.
[6:23 PM] ScoutsAnthem: Hopefully more ups than down.
[6:23 PM] h0p3: yes
[6:23 PM] ScoutsAnthem: Good.
[6:26 PM] ScoutsAnthem: Got to try THC  that was in a crystal form that turns to wax it was "99.8%" THC.
[6:26 PM] h0p3: How'd you like it?
[6:26 PM] ScoutsAnthem: Nothing like our trip for three days. But the second most intense trip I have had.
[6:27 PM] h0p3: Sick.
[6:29 PM] ScoutsAnthem: Gage brought it home andasked if I wanted to try it out with him. Fastest I have ever had THC take effect 2mins in I could start to feel it. 5 mins in felt like had done like 2 joints and then 10min we were full blown going. Last a few hours.
[6:30 PM] h0p3: Sounds extremely intense.
[6:30 PM] ScoutsAnthem: My perception of time was affected
[6:30 PM] ScoutsAnthem: I had my stopwatch on my phone going for each time I felt a change happen.
[6:33 PM] ScoutsAnthem: It felt like time was taking longer than normal. Like slowed down. Was cool to have that happen

[11:25 PM] ScoutsAnthem: Sorry I missed your call I was asleep
[11:25 PM] ScoutsAnthem: Little napy nap
[11:25 PM] h0p3: hell yeah
[11:25 PM] h0p3: you doing alright?
[11:26 PM] ScoutsAnthem: Yeah. I'm ok.  How about your self?
[11:32 PM] ScoutsAnthem: Whatch working on?
[11:34 PM] h0p3: I'm thinking about this language, Forth, for a [[Prompted Introspection]]. I'm catching up on my wiki in general. Sending a letter to [[BL]], and finishing a scathing piece for an institution called OpenAI.
[11:40 PM] ScoutsAnthem: So had to look up FORTH lol didn't know it's was a thing. How are you applying this to your " Prompted Introspection"?
[11:42 PM] h0p3: https://philosopher.life/#2020.06.10%20-%20Prompted%20Introspection%3A%20Forth
[11:55 PM] ScoutsAnthem: So was forth used to create the art work of a [[chameleon]]?   The more I'm reading on it a quote from Michelangelo keeps coming to mind "I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free.".
[11:55 PM] ScoutsAnthem: The artwork you find on chameleons page
[11:55 PM] h0p3: Nope. I can't write Forth. I wish I could.
[11:56 PM] h0p3: Had I more time and fewer responsibilities, it's a place I wish I had studied as a child.
[11:56 PM] h0p3: or even now, lol
