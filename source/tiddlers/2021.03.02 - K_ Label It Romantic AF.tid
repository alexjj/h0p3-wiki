Hope you are doing well, sir. How was your week?
Mar 2 12:55am
Week was solid. Work is slowing for a bit. Plenty of time to start on bigger assignments. :)

[[L]] got me a processor for Valentine‚Äôs Day which is working wonderfully, but pretty sure my power supply is dying now so that sucks. But we‚Äôre replacing it Saturday so fingers crossed!
Mar 2 11:08am
How have you been doing? :)
Mar 2 11:08am
I'm glad to hear it's slowing down some. A processor? What kind?
Mar 2 1:39pm
I'm sorry to hear your PSU is dying. Some last forever, some don't. It's one of the few times I actually buy by namebrand.
Mar 2 1:40pm
I'm good. Diving into everything, reading and writing. I need to exercise more.
Mar 2 1:40pm
My output has slowed down some, and now that Sphygmus is logging into my/our machine, it's more private than usual for me.
Mar 2 1:41pm
We swapped from a six core to an AMD fxtm 8320 eight core. I have a friend bringing a more modern gold PSU to replace my crappy bronze on Saturday haha. 

Masters program weight is  starting to get to me so I feel you there too haha. 

That‚Äôs exciting! How can you both interact together that way? üëÄ
Mar 2 1:44pm
Nice to have upgrades, homie. `/high-5`. I don't even have a gold PSU*. I screwed up on getting mine. I thought it would be enough for GPU passthrough and a second NVME, but it wasn't. I'll cross that bridge later if I really need to.
Mar 2 1:49pm
You are kicking ass, sir. I know it's heavy.
Mar 2 1:49pm
Just need to eat more greens lol

She has remote desktop through NoMachine, SSH access, my root password. I have, at the moment, a single workspace dedicated to her (she doesn't want more yet, just a room in the house - the other options would be fancy hacks or complete integration into my chaos).
Mar 2 1:51pm

‚ù§Ô∏è
We're collaborating in her workspace.
Mar 2 1:52pm
(aw yeah :P)
Mar 2 1:53pm
She's also on our VPN and has resilio sync for all the other things.*
Mar 2 1:53pm
I‚Äôm happy you all are finding ways to connect amidst all the complications. ^_^ it‚Äôs wonderful to hear.
Mar 2 1:54pm

What kind of label would you apply to this form of relationship? Just out of curiosity.
Mar 2 2:05pm
Apologies if that‚Äôs a weird question. I just wonder how you all would view each other at this point if that makes sense.
Mar 2 2:06pm
Not a weird question, and you are my [[Root User]] (ask any question, please).
Mar 2 2:30pm
I don't know how to label it in a few words. She doesn't know what this is either.
Mar 2 2:31pm
It's fully remote, distance, whatever the fitting the term, and that is awkward, insufficient, and challenging.
Mar 2 2:32pm
We both live in our own heads a lot (always have), and since we read and write so much with each other, it's this surprising connecting neither of us have ever had, in a way.
Mar 2 2:33pm
I've been down this road before, and she has not. She's slow to commit (not just to people), but I know what I want.
Mar 2 2:34pm
I want her to be my {[[Axiom]]}.
Mar 2 2:34pm
She's my girlfriend. eGF. SO. Life partner. She's a soulmate. Those are all fine labels to me, but she has to pick, and she's got time. I'm going to wait and enjoy whatever I can with her.
Mar 2 2:37pm
I'm her beggar. =)
Mar 2 2:38pm
I know that our stories are fundamentally intertwined at this point. We define each other to a significant extent.
Mar 2 2:40pm
That‚Äôs romantic as fuck.
Mar 2 2:51pm
I love it.
