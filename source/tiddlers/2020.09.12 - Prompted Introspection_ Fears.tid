title: 2020.09.12 - Prompted Introspection: Fears

!! List a few phobias you have. When and how did you discover you had these fears?

* I fear maliciously ignorant people.
** I'm still discovering what it means. [[Virtue is Knowledge]]. 
** I've encountered malicious violence since before I can remember, so I'm not sure where to begin here.
* I fear snakes, insects, spiders, germs, and small mobile creatures that give me the willies.
** I suggest parts of this have been hard-coded into my visual system. I can override it to some extent with effort, but the initial impulse is outside my control. I don't remember not having this fear.
* I fear the enslavement of Humanity.
** I'm still coming to understand just how far this one goes. Slavery is something that I was roughly taught to believe had largely disappeared in the world, but the internet, books, post-secondary schooling, traveling, and meeting different people have led me to see how wrong that belief was. It's kinda been a nightmare to wake up to.
* I fear veins/arteries.
** I don't like it. The feel, the look, etc. I am surprised I can even touch my penis or bandage a wound. Slowly, I've been able to overcome my fear of touching wrists and necks, though eyeball-touching is still no go for me (unless I just turn it off). This fear has waxed and waned for me. I can't pick out any particular times.
* I fear heights.
** Even when I trust my PPE, I really fucking hate heights. I don't like the //call of the void// experience either (common for me). I don't like getting past 3ft on a ladder. I'm a simple creature. I've always been afraid of heights.
