title: 2020.08.18 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Dusk

* Woke at 1
** That felt better.
* [[Morning Routine]] sans [[Fireman Time]]!
** I should not have skipped.
* Listened to my wife run the show with union stewards, then talked (I give my usual retarded backseat perspective).
** She's taking names and kicking ass. She's exhausted.
** S' game came back to bite him. It's obvious he doesn't know what the fuck he's doing (though he thrives in the chaos). She's doing his job for him (as everyone is pointing out). 
*** My new rule that I ask my wife to consider: "Is this S' job or does this only help S? If so, don't do it." Let the fucker crash and burn (though I think things will pan out okay from what I can tell); I don't think he has the capital (though given his incompetence, I agree that he must have dirt on someone to have his position because it makes no sense otherwise) or evidence to win here. He's a selfish vampire, and she doesn't protect herself. 
** Also a meeting with B where my wife is connecting dots for folks. 
*** I am grateful that my wife does such a good job constructing paper trails and looping people in, and she handles people on the fly so well. 
**** Funny part is: I'm the only one who seems to know where she's a rockstar. That's not what they pay her for though.
** SZ likes the seminary library book project. She should given her background. 
* Encouraged my offspring
** My daughter, who is going to drive me insane, set up whitelist DNSMasq up on both.
* Read+Write
* Watched vintage [[vidya]]s that WAP and ELEFANTE reminded us of with folx.
** My offspring know I'm a simple creature. One day, they will recognize they are simple creatures too.
* The Walk
** Dusk. Gorgeous. 
** My wife vented and chilled. 
** She took an extra today, good. Feeling that anxiety in her, like electricity running through me. 
** We happened upon James. `/salute`
* We were going to have [[Family Gathering]], and our offspring had already made dinner, but it went cold while we talking with James.
** They were okay with it though. They knew we had a good reason, and I'm glad they ate without us.
** Tendies, apples, and eggplant.
* Read+Write
* [[h0p3ful Review]]: Went well with my son, but despite so much encouragement all day, there was nothing with my daughter. Her call. 
* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 5
