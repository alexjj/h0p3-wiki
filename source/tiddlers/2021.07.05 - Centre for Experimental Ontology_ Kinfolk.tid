title: 2021.07.05 - Centre for Experimental Ontology: Kinfolk

Dear Centre for Experimental Ontology,

I'm glad to meet you. It's not often that I get to spend time with my SoTS kinfolk. `/hug`.

<<<
We of the Collective are deeply in love with hop3.
<<<

I am surprised to hear that. I'm pretty darn quiet in The City. I do what I can to avoid being noticed while fulfilling my mission. Have we met before?

[[Love]] is not a word I wield lightly. I ask you: what is love? I'm always in need of [[seeing|Phenomenology]] the world through the eyes of my beloved. 

<<<
Would hop3 like to be hosted (also) on the CEO website as a hypertext novel alongside the other books under the book header?
<<<

You are free to host it. I ask that it be given away for free and untouched to maintain the embedded [[signature|Cryptographic Verification]]. If you'd like custom methods for mirroring, I can set that up with you. 

<<<
As the Centre for Experimental Ontology, the Collective is but one influence among many – and so we are debating hop3's merits and possibility of joining a super-structure.
<<<

Well, I [[hope]] you take your time debating my merits. [[I know I do|Know Thyself]]. Most require significant [[wrestling]] with me to know. I'm certainly interested in [[Justice]], and, thus, I'm just as interested in [[intimacy]] with you.

<<<
We usually make an author profile and give editing permissions for the chosen to express themselves through the CEO platform.
<<<

I can appreciate that. You are free to make a profile. I know I do in [[FTO]]. As part of my own, my ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 includes several kinds of biography and profiling of many authors, and I'm happy to express myself directly from this object.

<<<
As for the consideration for Parasol: Ghosts (Special Issue), we could write an essay/abstract introducing hop3 and pointing towards its host (philosopher.life) and the CEO book section.
<<<

I have no idea how best to be useful to you, nomad. If you think this ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 (or even just particular sections that interest you) is suitable for inclusion or mention, I'm glad to hear it. I  [[aim]] to go with the flow here.

<<<
The AF Collective itself has "a hop3", her name is Lis and she is hiding for now as we progress into making her work her way into print from the shells of her codes, veritably transducing algorithms towards the material immediate dimension. Lis is qlippotic, and so construed under the Idea of Evil which she embodies.
<<<

You must forgive an autist for being such a poor interpreter of another's poetry, mysticism, and perspective. My deficits are severe. No matter how it is [[embodied|Embodied Cognition]], I do not take the problem of evil lightly either. I am glad to hear you are concerned with metaphysics. It is this nebulous swearword among most of the learned today. What do you think of metaphysics?

<<<
That would be, we think, the perfect dyad to hop3 in the dialectical dance they are already performing since before our time.
<<<

That's an exceptionally strong claim. I'd like to understand what you mean by it. Are you familiar with modal realism? 

<<<
Let us know what you think.
<<<

Well, I'm interested to begin a conversation with you. Not everyone wants to commit to such a thing with me. I'm an incredibly expensive person to speak with. I am convinced that maintaining a relationship with me requires [[love]].

<<<
We are currently infecting the rest of the CEO meatbags with the Plutonic resplendor of hop3 in the hopes of making them agree with this very suggestion here.
<<<

XD. [[Memetic Warfare]] is a brilliant topic. What do you think of the CCRU?

<<<
Get Outlook for Android
<<<

You may point me to a link to follow or [[contact me|Contact]] through the means I've set out. I've moral problems with both Outlook and Android, and I think we can avoid using these. 

I'm [[grateful]] that you allow me to explore the world with you. 

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
