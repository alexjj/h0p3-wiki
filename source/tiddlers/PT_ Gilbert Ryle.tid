; 1900-1976: Gilbert Ryle

* The analytic techniques of formal logic cannot resolve philosophical problems.
* Materialist mechanism cannot by itself explain mental phenomena; human affairs need explanations of different kinds and levels.
* Cartesian dualism ("ghost in the machine") is a category mistake.
* Our talk of "the mind" does not require the existence of a private space within which mental acts and happenings take place.
* Having a mind is a matter of possessing abilities (knowing how to do things), dispositions, and inclinations (emotions).
* When we perceive or have sensations, we are attending to features of the world or of our bodies, not to our experiences.
* If our experiences have to be attended by us, that awareness experience must also be attended - this sets off an absurd regress.
* We can choose to attend to the experiences of perception/sensation, but it will be retrospective and fallible.
* Our first-person statements about intentions and decisions are "avowels" and not descriptions of our mental states.
* The self is elusive; when we try to attend to ourselves, we put ourselves beyond our reach.
