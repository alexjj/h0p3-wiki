!! How has your health been this week?

* 1uxb0x
** It was fairly fine. I don't have any complaints I can think of at the moment. My acne's not doing well, but I'll fix that, and I'm no longer sure if I have carpal tunnel or anything at all really.
*** I do think your wrist/forearm is hurting you; you should definetely keep it in mind to talk to your doctor about at your appointment. 
* j3d1h
** Pretty decent. Felt utterly exhausted on Saturday, not sure why. I think music's affecting my mood too much.
*** If so, this has been a problem for a //long// time.
* k0sh3k
** Good; I need to be more intentional about my exercises now that PT is winding down, but everything seems ok. I have been *very* tired this week. 
* h0p3
** Sleep has been all sorts of fucked up, but I've been feeling good overall. Time seems to be flying ever faster. It's a sign that my days are growing more predictable (and I don't consider that a bad thing).

!! What was interesting to you last week?

*Figuring out student employment was frustrating, especially since it wasn't supposed to be my bailiwick. 
* Getting to welcome someone not just to *our* library but to libraries generally for the first time ever was very cool!
**Also, getting to talk to someone who was considering librarianship as a career was niftybeans. 
* Spending time with [[MWF]] & [[SLT]] was pretty fun.
** Spoiled rotten, as usual.
*** You've been rotten for aaaaaages. 
**** Rotten//er//.
* I enjoyed driving go-cart
* Speaking with [[ASK]] has been a privilege. 
* A [[Letter]] has been written (that's almost a monthly streak). 
* We're still trying to deal with the flip the house experienced.

!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family (including ourselves)?

* 1uxb0x
** I think I've gotten better at tf2-not better than average, but better than just playing.
** I appreciate how hard it was for you to choose a project and not let your difficulty picking one stop you from having fun. I also really liked your string art! 
** Thank you for putting air in my tires! 
** I'm glad that you joyfully came down to spend time with me on Saturday. It made my day better.
** I very much enjoyed the walk where you led the conversation this week. 
** You strike a nice balance between serious conversation and being tons of fun to chat with.
* j3d1h
** I think I've been more open to new, interesting experiences, without getting too stressed about doing it "right".
** I had fun arting with you this weekend! It's cool to see how you approach learning a new skill and picture art in your head coming out onto the medium. 
** I enjoyed playing TF2 with you, and I'd like to do it again sometime.
** You've done an excellent job picking out clothing in two stores. Your clothes suit you. I like that you have a wide range in style too. I wouldn't know what to call it, and I like that.
* k0sh3k
** I did a good job finding system problems with course reserves and fixing/delegating them. 
*** Also, I did a cool teal pumpkin. 
** You have incredible patience with your peers, workers, and the people you serve. I think you've been handling the case of M thoughtfully and practically. They probably have no idea.
** Thank you for handling a large part of the conversations with our grandparents, and for trying to make sure I watched my language.
** You consistently make leaps of logic easier in conversation.
* h0p3
** I like the look of the kitchen cabinets without the doors on them. Plain shelves work. I'm glad I took something frustrating (in unobvious ways here) and made lemonade.
***Great, now I want lemonade.  Also, yes, you were right about the cabinets - they look nice without doors. 
** Thank you for making dinner with me; I like doing some cooking, but I don't like doing it alone. Also, thank you for understanding/putting up with my weird standards on some things and not others. 
** I greatly enjoyed spending time with you downstairs this weekend.
** Thanks for leaving me some time to myself later on in the past week. I needed it.
