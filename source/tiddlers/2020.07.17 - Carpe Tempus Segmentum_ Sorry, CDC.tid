title: 2020.07.17 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Sorry, CDC

* Woke at 10:30
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Laundry
* Read+Write
** Slowly working my way through [[Chatlog]] [[review]]s.
** Reading the news sucks. I can barely take what I'm seeing in the world.
* Checkins
* IRS is still fucked
* Picked up a book per [[AA]]'s suggestion.
* Called [[AIR]]
** Got to see a meme post, but that was it.
* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
* The Walk
** I can't remember half, as usual. 
** She had to type on my phone. I think she didn't enjoy being on my phone, lol.
*** My wife compared my phone to my brain, too many pieces of software open at the same time (so, I've learned how she navigates hers), a maze.
*** Curious to think about the size of the gut as it might affect our limbic systems. I have an Aristotelian hypothesis.
** I have an umbrella-cane with a strap. It's been raining unpredictably.
*** I feel like I'm walking around with my samurai sword, of course.
**** Wotchurself now
** We made it all the way to the camp.
*** We went slowly. It was pleasant.
*** Unfortunately, I'm worried about mildew. There's been a lot of water.
** Saw Max and his youngest son.
*** Not the philosopher. I would like to know more about both.
**** They have the names of tsars. 
*** I have no idea what to say, lol. 
**** "Hey, would you like to speak with a crazy person about what matters to us? I'm a huge fan of titties, interwebs, and tendies, how bout u?"
* Got snacks set for my wife. She doesn't like to eat with the camera. 
* My wife had her bookclub. 
** She had a blast! =) 
** I often stop by from the side to watch (it's a habit now, as I often have to put faces to names in meetings, etc.). 
*** I am grateful that I do not have to participate in such a thing.
** Elizabeth is separated. =/. 
*** Fuck. I am surprised. That makes no sense. 
*** I'm glad she participated. Quieter than anticipated.
*** Need to ask if she knows Rebecca. They both have masters in public health, and they develop policy for the state of KY. Surely, they have run across each other in the capitol. 
**** They have a lot of similarities actually. Atheist, they really do care about their sciences, they read a lot, and they are extremely competent in everything they do.  
* Chats
* I was offered sex, and I turned it down (I'm still questioning my sanity) because I wanted a walk instead.
** I think you're an idiot. =)
* Mini-Walk
** Just around the neighborhood a couple times. 
* [[AIR]] called me back
** [[JRE]] is sittin' with him until Gage comes back. 
** He's safe. Says it's like that one time we rode horses. 
** Drugs were way heavier than anticipated, and he had full blown wall-breathing replications.
** They were not gentle with his balls (all of us boys have extra sensitive sacks, and we have to curl our toes to cum).<<ref "i">>
* [[h0p3ful Review]]: Ugh.
** In fact, both had failed. I just sent them upstairs.
* Chicken and cherries
* //MasterChef// S08E16-21 completely manipulated me. 
** No, ur crying. 
** I, too, now believe both in the American Dream and that Chef Ramsay is a good human. 
*** I am reminded of //American Sniper//, but one who ungratefully spits out food.
** What they call pressure-cooking I call gaslighting. The plebs cry in happiness as they live another day.
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 4?
