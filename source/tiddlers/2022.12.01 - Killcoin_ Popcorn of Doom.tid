Finally, dang.

`/popcorn` indeed

You guys doing well?
I'd say we are surviving. Been emotional, stressful, busy AF.
World keeps moving faster.
How about you?

Surviving as well, trying to do good, and fretting over/loving trying to be a good father.

Yes, sir.

Have you ever read the Satanic Verses?

Unfortunately, I've never heard of it.

Some book that ticked the Muslim peoples off, they've also been trying to kill the author.

`/nod`.

It's bizarre.
