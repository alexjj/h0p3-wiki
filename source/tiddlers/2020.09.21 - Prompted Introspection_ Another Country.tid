title: 2020.09.21 - Prompted Introspection: Another Country

!! Have you ever lived in another country besides your country of birth? Would you want to?

I lived in [[Thailand]]. In some respects, even moving across the continental US can be like living in a different country (but not completely, imho). Having spent time outside of the US was extremely important. I learned what exploitation and poverty meant more effectively. I got to see the flaws and appreciables in my own cultures and country of birth. I learned plenty about human beings, myself, and my family. Living as [[the other]], even as a semi-high-status foreigner, helped me understand the classic concept of hospitality through experience. If I got to push a button and legally live elsewhere with at least the employment we have now, it would have to be Scandinavia (we've thought about it, but it seems exceptionally unlikely). The more I watch the catastrofuck unfolding this year, the more I appreciate that desire and the more I realize it's out of reach.
