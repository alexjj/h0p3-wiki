!! Audit:

* It continues to become even more link-dumpy. 
* Contextlinks do good work. There's just enough signal and pointing for a meaningful map.
* Constructing my own corpus/archive still doesn't feel like a priority to me. 
** If the web has a 5 year half-life, maybe I need to get on it though.
*** Of course, after just a year, the linkrot seems acceptable so far.
** Trying to change my mind still, a year later. 
* My ability to pick out links for my [[Root Users]] is an abject failure. [[kicks]], in particular, derives little benefit from my work. I am sad to say that I've failed the man. I can't pick the links he seeks out. ┌[ O ʖ̯ O ]┐
** Although, [[Sphygmus]] and [[chameleon]] link hardcore too. They build more context than I do. It does SO much work for them. Even from the outside, I consider it exceptional. 
* I have no great way to gauge how useful my offspring have found it.
* I have, of course, been plenty worried about my productivity in here.
* Indeed, I am [[grateful]] to have more RAM. It has changed how I feel about this log. 
** There's something to be said for actually having to use resources to hold my places and originals in memory.
* I've enjoyed more garbage, and I've also moved away using some of the traditional sources.
* Continual declines in commentary and context.
* Note that last time this year, I was also not doing great. I could barely even get a [[Link Log]] up. 
** Wasn't until Yale that anything came back.
* There was a curious attempt at using [[Prompted Introspection]] as a [[Link Log]]. Seems like a failure.
* It feels like these links are happier than 2020s by miles. 
* The growth of hashed and non-text media continues here. 
** Really does feel like a heresy here. It makes the family happier though.
*** It continues to do some work during [[Family Time]]. Who doesn't like a pile of links?
** But, that captures my media consumption preferences better too. It's a better model prima facie.
* A shift downward on the window over the categories. Way less //KYS//, for example, and way more //SCWR// these days.
* CV19 and Election makes it totally different from 2019. Was similar 4 years ago, if you remember, sir.
* Oh, shit, interesting coincidence. Today, someone who was tying together Sirlin + The Gervais Principle went on to attempt to add https://external-preview.redd.it/XfA_bEntJfG0FRh9a-ynldOV1NSj4DW4zUpC6lqslVE.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=cfe017e88cbe683add8f373b33da8ea3b65a5633, and I just stumbled across it again during this process. We have clearly been in the same circles.
* I'm really glad you resurrected it, btw, dude.
* I can definitely feel how many of these comments require digging into the contexts for reference.
* This is quite a stream, and picking out the fishies is expensive. 
* I continue to agree to the claim that you can model me surprisingly well just by going off the links. No, it doesn't touch the [[CDR]]s well enough, but it still feels huge to me.
