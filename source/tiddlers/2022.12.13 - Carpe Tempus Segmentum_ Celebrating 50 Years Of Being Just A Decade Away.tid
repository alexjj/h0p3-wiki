title: 2022.12.13 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Celebrating 50 Years Of Being Just A Decade Away

No idea when I woke, but I phased in and out until I got up at 5:30. Depression sleep has its perks: sleep. Hugs'n'bugs with my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]]. Mi amor is up. Chilled with her, made coffee, she went from running late to not. Not enough sleep, and doesn't want to go to work today (second in a row). [[5c0ut]] seems to be feeling somewhat better, and he didn't need anything. Hugs. Mi amor refuses to use a cup that has someone else's name on it at work. I suppose signaling in that environment is expensive. Chat with [[Ignota]]. =). [[TTTOTW]].

Offspring had some shopping to do. [[j3d1h]] is on shark week and wants meat. I made burgers for us. Shuffled up my deck while we talked. I think the black pinpoint removal slows me down too much, and E-Witness recursion seems fine enough (wish I had a worthy sacrifice option to feed the Genesis machine). I really need an exile effect instead. Might just splash for white. 

Blew [[Piotr M. Salomon]] a kiss. I don't imagine they really give a shit, so I'll make it brief. Still, there is plenty to mine on his account. [[TTTOTW]]. Caffeine. //Drive My Car//.

Although I'm a nuclear [[power]] fanboi, I think the announcement smells fishy. Science reporting is often hype, but this one smacks of nationalism. Doesn't sit right with me. Lots of unpleasant signals today too. Prolly my schzotardations, so leave it alone.

The [[MTG]] trio convened to trade and build. At this point, I want everyone to have a badass deck. No fun roflstomping, so I'll trade whatever they want for their decks. Three deck concepts have emerged, imho: Heavy G Ramp Survival Toolbox Bombing, WGBx Dedi Control, and UWx Artifact/Land-based Combo with control elements. [[5c0ut]] hit the doctor, and he's being referred to a specialist. Diverticulitis possibility. Had anticipated picking up my sympaticon's friend from the train station, but never materialized. Clarinet.

Mi amor called just as I was picking up my phone to make sure I'd have it on me. SZ's stressload spilling over. One day at a time. Ready for the test, and then things shoudl slow down for the paper. 

Mi amor brought candy and a coffee present (no idea how she acquired, but dope). //Raw Skintime// with mi amor. //Inform the Men!// Meditation. [[TTTOTW]]. Shuffled up the deck. It's finally flowing somewhat. 

[[Family Gathering]] was solid. We had chicken, rice, and a bright salad with nuts in it. I had some tea left from the morning to drank too. //Mr. Robot//. Nobody has a clear idea how it will end. [[TTTOTW]]. //Skintime// with my sympaticon. Talked with her about the zero-rent commy-esque democracy house. Sleep by 8:30?
