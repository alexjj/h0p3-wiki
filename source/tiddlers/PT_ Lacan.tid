* In the recognition of its mirror-image, the child is having its first anticipation of itself as a unified and separate individual.
* The 'I' is an 'other' from the ground up: an artificial projection of subjective unity modeled on how one is seen from other perspectives.
* 'The Imaginary' is our quotidian reality: who and what one imagines other persons to be, etc.
* 'The Symbolic' is the customs, institutions, laws, mores, etc, of cultures and societies (the 'Other'), entwined with language.
* 'The Real' is whatever is beyond phenomenal appearances; it is intrinsically elusive and uncapturable by Imaginary-Symbolic signs.
* The insertion into socio-symbolic contexts and the dependence on the foreignness of signifiers amount to a 'symbolic castration'.
* 'Master signifiers' (those that the subject most deeply identifies with, like nationality) are actually signifiers without a signified
* The unconscious in not an anarchic bundle of animalistic instincts like the id - it is structured like language.
* Demand - need = desire: vital requirements take on the excess baggage of meanings and become socio0symbolic demands for love.
* 'Drive' extracts enjoyment ('jouissance') from the dissatisfaction of desire, sometimes through repetitive or overwhelming experiences,
* The Real of sexuation creates incommensurable structural-psychical positions for the sexes; there is no sexual relationship
