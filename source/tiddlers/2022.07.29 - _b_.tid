Big O approaches to infinity may give us reason to reduce complexity down to what are more likely the most significant factors. Fundamentalism.

I get 5 hedons every time I ask a utilitarian how many utils they think I get for asking them how many hedons they think I get for asking. I only get 2.3541 utils for telling you this, [[ITS]] (and an extra 0.092345 hedons for this [[hlexical]] phrase).

Beyond deepening the recession until a crisis that tightens the spiral, one reason why we won't see Volcker-style increases in rates to combat inflation meant to limit demand (and hence prices) generated through cheap credit is that it would throw the federal government itself into immediate insolvency. Even a 7% interest rate might be too high given how a sizeable chunk of US debt is in short-term bonds. Each rollover would result in higher and higher interest payments until the entire federal budget would be consumed by interest payments. Eventually, similar to Japan, the US may not be able to credibly offer positive interest rates. The Fed, who has yet to even openly recognize a recession, also loses credibility in pivoting, as it will reveal how little ability they have to stop printing money for the wealthiest people on the planet. Without taxing the hyperwealthy (including jubilees for the poor) and wisely redistributing, the only way to prevent a crash on the one hand or federal insolvency on the other is to cyclically print their way out, which only makes it more unreasonable to hold USD as reserve in the long run unless you are at the absolute tippy top of the pyramid. [[peruvian bull]] is correct.

Too often, fears or beliefs are labeled a "conspiracy" if they contradict some mere subjective normative belief held by a dominant group with which the labeler identifies.
