//Word to your lethological nonce form [[PH]] and all-purpose pseudo-metasyntactic-variable salad. Ummm...I [[faith]]fully adore sensible nonsense and the ambiguous limits of the imprecision of The Precise. Blank-mindedly point with your bigboy babble-names to the temporarily ineffable because it's better than saying nuffin'. Roll off your tongue, shamelessly fill in the gaps, and constructively [[ltf]] with schizophrenic gunky putty, fugly foobar hacks, no your other lefts, and WD-40-had-a-baby-with-duct-tape linguistic glubricant. You certainly know what I mean: it's probably [[good]] enough, ~~left~~ [[right]]? Ya' feel me? [[JHBFC]], amen.//
