title: 2021.05.01 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: May Day Mayday

Woke at 7? Sleeping so hard. Dreams drowning me, in a good way. Back feels better with that couch-like feel. #Fat-people-things. I like being snuggled by my bed in the corner, kinda like a venus flytrap voring me (if I made a mattress, it would have holes for sleeves, of course).

Fireman Time! Need to find a place to put my toys now. 

[[TTTOTW]]. I feel much better upon seeing a voldydrop. I have several people I need to write to. Instead of doing what I should, I took a shit, [[Morning Routine]], ⁸Δ⁸,<<ref "5">> and wandered. 

//Skintime//. Inform the Men! Shower of the gods! Massage (could not get that knot out, no matter what I did; she needs to see a doctor). Woke offspring, assignments. Made breakfast together.

[[Family Gathering]] sans [[5c0ut]] (saved a plate though). Pancakes (experiment for fluffiness worked), honey, baked bacon (you fuckin' got me: I like it), pineapple, coffee. Losers talking at the table about losery things. 

Game, match point against my son. He redzoned me with bombs and smart play. But PTitan and Capsize hot-potato.tactic bought me enough time to Wrath and then trounce after stabilization. His use of LoA has improved. I was lucky to win that game, and I saw no mistakes from him that I can recall (given the information available to me, ofc). He's becoming a beast to play against.

A match against my daughter. Bribery smash G1, G2 I was absolutely screwed (Hymn too) with a godly hand that was unplayable (not even enough to drop the thopter combo), G3 was a JKite+Forbid lock that grew out of control (I accepted the scoop because there was no way out from what I could remember of her deck).

[[TTTOTW]]. Broski came down to chill for a bit. [[TTTOTW]].

Dialectures. Same story, different day. Son missed his meeting for it.

Shopping @ W-Entity with my wife instead of a walk. We got frozen foods we lacked, felt for the soles of the legs of the chairs (scratches on the floor =/), mints for my son, a small shop vac, mesh chairs for the back, and hooks. I saw some amazing titties today. 

[[TTTOTW]]. The youngest 4 of the household met. Pizza, tater tots, pickled veggies, and pineapple (water too). Played a match against my daughter, and it was fast. My son wanted to play chess, so we did. He wants to watch the championship this year (fuck yeah), and maybe we'll play around with the GPU tooling while we watch (or, Chess Network, or both). 

[[TTTOTW]]. Wife came down, and the bedcouch fits us both perfectly. [[TTTOTW]].
