Hey! How are you? I'll respond in this nifty colour below. Although at some point we're going to have to start a whole new paragraph, but I'm too lazy right now :)

<<<
Don't worry about how long it takes (it takes me a very long time in some cases, embarrassingly, like, over a year, ugh), I'm really glad you wrote when you could! I totally understand the feeling of being overwhelmed too. I've been curling up and in [[Reply Mode]] for quite a while now. Things are lookin' up though, I think. Ups and downs. I'm feeling lost. You know how it is.
<<<

I do. I hope more ups than downs for you, though. We had a really rough patch but things are more manageable now.  

<<<
I am unable to know how much of a difference it makes (though I have many opinions and guesses), but it is non-zero and not insignificant for you and those around you. Yes, Amazon knows a fuckton about me too, though I am able to tease apart my identities on the web to some degree. I think it's the right thing to do, and that alone makes it worth it.

I think the synergy of moving towards platforms you own is something you build over time. Start with FF and Protonmail and keep going. There's far more autonomy granted by increasing your ownership in your infrastructure than privacy. Freedom isn't convenient, sadly. It's a lot of work.
<<<

You mentioned later on a TDL. I would love that 😂  Although it's obvious I need to start with protonmail, so I'll have a think about what I want to name that.

I definitely don't expect freedom. I didn't expect that before we had the whole Internet/virtual world; I sure as fuck dinnae expect it now! lol

<<<
I've been[[『Paused』]]for months now, but I've been writing quietly still. Everything is a whirlwind, and I think it's going to stay that way. My normal, eh?

I don't know enough about it. I'll agree those few in [[power]] in any nation as powerful as China are evil cunts though, yeah. Building and maintaining infrastructure is something the US sorely needs. What did you think about it?
<<<

Of course 'those in power' ... the class war is the only war ... but I definitely think China are up to no good on the world scale. I guess if you're Chinese, maybe it doesn't matter. But for the rest of us ... in reference to that 'new silk road', it's the usual thing - fucking over anyone and everyone who happens to be where they want stuff - poor people, tribes, whatever. Fuck the people, fuck the environment. Also, as you point out, US infrastructure is ashambles. China are positioning to be the 'number one country in the world', it's obvious. In fact didn't they just recently sign some thingy with Iran because, apparently, Biden has dropped the ball? Don't misunderstand me; I hate the govt of the US and I'd be happy to see it burn in hell. However, I have a lot of friends that live in close proximity so, selfish human that I am, fuck China lol 
Besides, all the nuclear shit is so scary. !!! 

<<<
Start by writing a list of services (and software) you use, separate out what is entangled or even wholly owned by bad actors, then attempt to replace those services with ones you control (preferably the most sensitive and critical pieces first).
<<<

I kind of already have a list, though most of them I know nothing about who is owned/affiliated with what. I guess I'll try to go through that systematically next time I don't get work in. I might have to ask you some questions during the process, lol

<<<
I hope he will be very careful in it. I don't know how much he has worked with asbestos before. That can be some serious shit. I've had to take exceptional precautions on jobsites because of it.
<<<

Ach aye, we kaen. It's a fucking nightmare. He's got the PPE etc he needs. The total bummer is that, for the mask, he had to shave his beard. It has been one of many really severe blows lately. Also, because it's not a straightforward job (i.e. will happen in fits and starts based on weather etc), it's not like he can just DO IT, then grow the beard back. This has been weeks already and will be at least weeks more, before that shite is all secured in plastic. In fact, it's another thing that sucks about the class war - you HAVE TO dispose of asbestos properly - which as a nature-lover I totally get - but you also HAVE TO pay through the nose to do so. It's so expensive. And of course, it's generally the poorer cunts who have to deal with asbestos in the first place because they could neither afford newer properties nor other folk to take care of it for them. ANd then, ye kaen what the council does with it? They put it in a hole in the ground. 

<<<
I don't see a reason to delete your accounts unless you do. It won't be perfect, no matter what you do. Something is better than nothing though. Maybe have two systems, one on FF and one one Chrome. Work to slowly migrate your practices from one to the other as best you can. You might consider using FF containers to isolate particular identities (a FB identity, a Google identity, and so on and so forth). I know it's expensive to start from absolute scratch or bootstrap; make it a transition you work on bit by bit every day instead. As I said, you won't be able to escape dealing with these surveillance capitalists, but you can minimize it.

I can draw up a giant [[TDL]] for ya, but I think starting with simple things like FF and Protonmail gives you a reasonable base to start with. I can't say you'll feel happy about it, but you may be satisfied upon reflection. Most people aren't going to take the time to visit the platforms you use (even if they are freedom-respecting), and that can be lonely. Perhaps you are asking for other kinds of justification.
<<<

I already use Firefox - as I said, I can't even log-in to my facebook on Chrome. I have the 'retainer' thing, is it called? That keeps facebook from tracking your non-facebook activity? I'm not sure what you mean about containers for different identities. I guess I just wonder how I can protect myself better... whilst acknowledging that using the Internet at all/ any social media/ free service etc makes that difficult ... I suppose there's also always the concern in the back of my head that it would be bad if certain student loan sharks in the US found me - possibly not good for the USgov to know either - but then again, if anyone really wanted me they could triangulate shit on social media and figure out who I am. I am friends with a lot of cunts from Berea, and my mother haha

By the way, did [[k0sh3k]] tell you she stole from me? Skimmed money off a transfer from my step-dad (and one from my gran last year)? Fun times. Parent sucks. But I believe you have some familiarity with this concept? 😂 

Thanks, again, and always. Hugs all around.
