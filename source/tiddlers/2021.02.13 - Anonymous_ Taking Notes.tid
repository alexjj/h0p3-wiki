title: 2021.02.13 - Anonymous: Taking Notes

//I've been summoned!//

<<<
how you keep your notes organized ?

I use just plain text files now, but want to switch to something that gives me tags and search

I think about self-hosted wiki, like TiddlyWiki, but maybe you have better solutions
<<<

I use TW. https://philosopher.life/ `/salute`. It's a pleasure to meet you, anon.

<<<
one of the best examples of tw usage that I've seen in my thematic researches
<<<

That's very high praise, [τнaиκ чou]. Download a copy. Maybe one day we'll connect, eh? Happy to answer questions. It is much larger than it looks.

<<<
What the fuck am I looking at
<<<

In my experience, the only way to understand it is to use it. I'd start here: https://philosopher.life/#Readme. If you have pointed and good faith questions to ask, anon (https://philosopher.life/#Anonymous), I'll do what I can to answer them. ʅʕ•ᴥ•ʔʃ

<<<
if you want, leave mail or any other preferable contact method
<<<

Cool! TTYL. https://philosopher.life/#Contact%20h0p3

I have no idea what this is about. I skimmed through the about page and I have no idea.
Can you please tell what this site is used for?
<<<

Oh, I appreciate your effort. Thank you. That is very generous of you. I [[aim]] to give you the best answer I can.

It serves many purposes, and it is about everything for me. I write to many, anon. Even your words will be in my ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱. There is a time and place for skimming and hyperreading through the enormous body of text (go ahead, check the source). I wager that it takes at least 10 hours for my interlocutors to gain their footing. This is egregious. I know. I am sorry, my friend.

There are some things that cannot be [[shared]] too quickly, but I aim to speed the construction of [[love]] as well as I know how. May there be ᛝLightᛝ in my world and in all of them.

this is exactly what would happen if you trained that AI program that tries to finish 30-second clips on the top posts on /r/lsd and the soliloquy from Trainspotting then asked it to grow a personality. i hope this isnt the work of just one person.
<<<

XD. Thank you. I appreciate that claim quite a bit.

Some searching of the document will demonstrate you are not the first to make that claim. I am happy to speak about ML with you, if you'd like, anon: https://philosopher.life/#Aispondence. Excepting the correspondence, it is almost entirely the hand-written work of a single human.

<<<
yeah i read on and figured it was indeed a individuals work only after id fiest posted— all id meant by that was i hoped my criticism wouldnt wind up taken too dear to heart by any one single person. look, its impressive and ambitious what youre doing. i like the effort and the slick hyperlinked framework for recurring thoughts its just that, speaking strictly as another writer, i cant take all the opera talk.

keep it up tho, its a good project.
<<<

You are all good, homie. (/¯–‿･)/¯ I appreciate your thinking about it with me, and I agree it's got a lot of fuckin' opera talk. Some of the entrances are required to be that dramatic. Most of the text, however, is plain, personal, and demonstrates how truly retarded I am in so many ways. Thank you for your sincerity. It means more to me than I know how to say. 

What do you like to write?

<<<
also, im sorry— i uh clicked some X next to a post about your wife and deleted something about her completely by mistake. hope that isnt permanent if ive would up with admin powers somehow
<<<

No worries. I try to keep the pilot's seat the same in appearance for both author and audience. I minutely push to a webserver, and, excepting my [[Root Users]] who may have VPN or R+W sync access to my network/files, my readers only have a copy. Roughly: https://philosopher.life/#RGM.

<<<
yeah, i just cant do with the decadence and density of your language but i know there are other zealots out there who would appreciate exactly that. my thoughts jumped to a wide circle of Less Wrong emigres who would really love the slick interface, the prose, and the candidness here.

i appreciate—genuinely appreciate—that you feel comfortable maintaining such an open public diary project. but, then again, you do sound like a good-natured fella and i got trust in you youre gonna grow your kids to become good people, bright, capable people.

cheers, homer

What a special opportunity for me to write only in my wiki rather than on both (unfortunately, [[New]]/[[Recent]] aren't up for now as I pay my respects). If you want to end the conversation, that's a graceful way to do so. `/bow`. I'm leaving the door open, of course, just in case. I try not to be the sort who locks my doors (even though I'm also not the sort who believes that most people are good [though I know we can change]). 

I've met my fair share of LW/SSC/Neo-Rationalist [[cult]] members. Some of them don't seem to mind too much, but I've found most eventually despise what I'm doing here (which is odd because I work so hard to be a champion of rationality). I hate to say it, but I find most of them lack humility, skin-in-the-game, and a desire to really become altruistic humans (these enormously privileged humans tend to hold reactionary positions in my experience, and I'm the sort who reads my enemies, of course).

That is extremely high praise. Thank you. I could only [[hope]] to be a worthy father. I consider myself a failure (to whom much is given, much is required). They really are amazing offspring though. I wish you could meet them, anon. If you got to know me, you could (they keep their own wikis too!). No doubt, keeping my [[ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱]] in public is a profound test of my identity. I can't even begin to explain without just pointing to it. I'm hoping to see more New Sincerity in the world (even laced with fitting amounts of irony, definitely a metamodern pill to swallow).
