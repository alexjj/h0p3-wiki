title: 2021.04.15 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Family

[[TTTOTW]]. LolVods while fixing [[m14]]. New screen did the trick. Glued down decently. Have 2 extra screen protectors, so might as well. It's noticeably more responsive too and that doesn't much make sense to me. Cleaned it up nice. May it last until [[monster-19]] might come online. Local-[[FTO]]. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! Chips+LolVod. Laundry. Cleaning+Organizing, and Pinephone Podcast (thus far not worth, but I'm trying). [[TTTOTW]].

She was up. It's raining, and her superpower is working, unfortunately. Shitty superpower. Why'd you choose that one? Picked out our meal. XOXOs until I couldn't keep my eyes open. [[Morning Routine]]

Deep sleep followed by a long rumination. Fireman Time! [[Morning Routine]], again. Hugs'n'bugs. Offspring were not proud. Though, [[j3d1h]] talked with me about a book she read, briefly. Turn it up. Write about it. You can do it. =). Broski got the job!

Played a match with my daughter. Light on real threats, so she can never convert and push her advantage fast enough to prevent stabilization. There's a lot of interaction though. 

She came down for a massage. I think it helped her headache some, and she was loose by the midpoint. //Skintime//. Assisted Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Messages with [[K]].

Made dinner with offspring. Played a game with my son to finish the match. Library of Alexandria is absurd, dominated the game; could not puke my hand out fast enough. Without LD, it was over before it began.

[[Family Gathering]]. Sketti with red sauce and sprouts, coffee, vapelyfe. It was a fun meal, and my offspring extra boisterous today. My son's laugh is still taking on shapes. Wife asked me to consider replacing my jeans. They are to' up. I like 'em tho. 

All 4 of us drafted. Lots of looking cards up. Lots of shocking packs too, where there were strings of 5 bombs. 4 packs a piece gives us a very wide range of decks that can be built, and everyone has enough goodstuff^^tm^^ to at least build something strong. Still think we'll end up banning some cards. LoA was absurd.

Assignments. Got my wife to eventually hit the sack (you're done writing :P). 

Talked late into the night with my bro. Talked about the interview, the place, having kids, vocation, [[Straussian]] interpretations of Paul, sneaking onto campus for classes, year-long "stage" (not pronounced as one might assume) in leet kitchens, and more. Can't recall it all.
