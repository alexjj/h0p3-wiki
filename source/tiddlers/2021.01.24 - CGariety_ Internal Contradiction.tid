title: 2021.01.24 - CGariety: Internal Contradiction

Hello again,

> Do you believe in free will and moral realism?
Yes.

> What do you think about The Dialetheia?
I think free will is the contradiction of the 'di' and the 'aletheia'.

> do you think there is an objective purpose to your life?
I think the purpose of my life overlaps with the principles of "be a good dad" and "be a good husband" that you have on your website.

> What did Saint Kant get terribly wrong?
I read [[this amusing story|https://www.quirkality.com/index.php/the-stories/26-immanuel-kants-and-a-young-woman-s-suicide]] recently.

> Are you a fan of any [[Straussian]] interpretation styles?
Yes I like Strauss. I'm going to write some posts about Strauss here pretty soon.

> how you think and feel computing systems ought to be built in the coming century
I think we should think about computers the same way we think about death. Computers do not carry the burden of contradiction, as life does. So we should make room for computers in society the same way we make room for cemeteries, mortuaries, and so on. The lack of contradiction is an indicator of lifelessness.

Question for you: you have this Hofstadter quote on your site ("No matter how a program twists and turns to get out of itself, it is still following the rules inherent in itself.") Doesn't this quote suggest that computer programs have internal contradiction? And doesn't that mean that they are alive, and that they should for that reason self-organize? But where else do they get the spirit (in the Hegelian sense of Geist) unless they borrow it from the human being?
