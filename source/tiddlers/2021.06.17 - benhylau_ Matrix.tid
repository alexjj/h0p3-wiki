1. Are there more technical references to this list? For example, I find this hard to believe:

> Email addresses, phone numbers of the user and their contacts.

2. Is this the case if federation is turned off on the self-hosted server? For example, sending these to Matrix's server, or any other, is expected behaviour if federation is on... otherwise how does it federate?

> Every file, image, video, audio that is uploaded to the Homeserver.
> Profile name and avatar of users.

The post seems to read a bit biased against Matrix. I would've preferred if they gave more specific examples and technical proof.

Element/Matrix is not the answer at the moment (maybe it will be P2P-viable some day, and maybe Cabal will become worthy too), but I don't have one I adore. Session and Tox (and Retroshare) are the best answers I've got so far.

I am more wondering the basis for this. For example, if there is a source of in-depth technical analysis of the claims in the article, or an opportunity for feedback from Matrix why certain things are done in a particular way.

It's very easy to criticize any FOSS project. Of their origins, clients, ties to some partner or funding sources, specific technical behaviour, etc. Signal similarly gets a lot of criticism, bc they didn't open source their servers, and didn't respond quickly to someone who filed a security report. I generally feel these criticisms don't help open source / security-focused software, and push people away from what is otherwise a good project.

re: Matrix, while I think their UX is terrible, I tend to defend them for making federated chat mainstream, and prioritizing e2e-encryption, and writing about the challenges of doing that in a federated world. It's not easy, they invested heavily into it, and in implementing and re-implementing the UX made the usability miserable for many people, but it was important.

Of course, I'd like Aether to be the go to homeserver solution (one day!), and I think @b can do a much much better UX job than Matrix ðŸ˜Ž but as someone who ran Synapse for many years and knowing several Matrix folks, I do support Matrix and don't want to dismiss the amazing job they have accomplished.
