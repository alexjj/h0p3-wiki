title: 2022.05.15 - Family Log: Nearing Improbable Territory

!! How has your health been this week?

* 1uxb0x
** It was alright.
* j3d1h
** decent. gotta remember iron and vitamin d.
* k0sh3k
** Headaches this week, boo...
* h0p3
** I am allergic to latex, phthalates, or something. It required two meds to deal with. Sloughing. I'm giving them to [[JRE]] (not the skin particles), especially since he's the only immediate blood relative beyond our donors I've not bought or crafted toys for. Sleep has been off, at least a cycle a night. Far more rumination than usual.
* ASK
** I'm not really okay. I am showing signs of pending stabilization and if I don't screw it up I might probably be okay.

!! What was interesting to you last week?

* Artgroup and Flashes.
* An Obsidian
* A huge shopping day, and Restaurant Depot was something else.
* I'm growing sad and annoyed that I've not seen a Ber drop yet. We are nearing improbable territory.
* I appreciate how [[5c0ut]] has been going through what feels like a small piece of hell for him. He's putting up a good fight, putting his integrity on the line. 3 Cheers for [[5c0ut]]!
* I enjoyed making a magic system with my sister.
* Hiking! I actually enjoyed it a lot.
* Cookies! I always enjoy those.
* Greek! I hope the summer reading group works out well.

!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family (including ourselves)?

* 1uxb0x
** I'm happy I muse to myself (and my recorder) outside while mowing.
*** Good musing time!
** I like discussing your schoolwork with you - even things I would normally find uninteresting, like scientific notation. I like the way you describe what you're learning.
** I appreciate how you pick up the slack for your sister. You mercifully give her flexibility at the expense of your own. You're prioritizing wisely in this hard problem. 
** i love the worlds you're building so far (especially the fantasy one). :)
** I appreciate how careful you are not to hurt my feelings.
*** No problem!
* j3d1h
** my lineart changed, and i think it looks nice this way.
** We're all lucky to eat the cookies you made with your mother. 
** "Your buddy" is lucky to have you as his. I'm glad to see your relationship grow together, including in no small part in virtue of your shared loss.
** Thank you for helping me make cookies - and for helping me plan what would go in each. :) Also, thank you for helping me make stirfry - it's been a long time since I made dinner on the fly. :)
** I enjoyed making a magic system with you-you clearly know what you are doing when you make one.
** I greatly enjoy your part in group conversations.
* k0sh3k
** I did well in Greek again this semester! Yay!
** I helped Mortius translate something into Spanish, and did a pretty good job of it!
** The cookies were outstanding. Thank you.
** When you can't do your job, you find other useful things to do. 
** You're exceptionally generous to the students who are most in need (even if it is their own fault). You change lives by how you gather resources for their work.
** Thank you for planning the hiking date.
** Thank you for making dinner out of the blue.
** you have an awful sense of humour in the best way. (i killed angel, my buddy, with the punnier things you sent me.)
** Thank you for the cookies, they were very good.
** Thank you for making dinner the night I was especially unwell.
** Preacher cookies were the best, and I'd like to learn how to make them.
* h0p3
** I do a decent job of balancing my investment of myself in people. I [[hope]] to work on my [[bias]]es [[irwartfrr]]. 
** Thank you for going hiking with me! I had a lot of fun, even if we never found the waterfalls.
** Sometimes I think that you are the only Beautiful person in the world.
** Thank you for playing with me! Also, thank you for helping me become a better player, and for twinking my character.
** You are brilliant and I adore special interesting with you.
** you've got some sick plans for the ideal world.
** Thank you for raising me to be efficient with my sources of joy-such as music.
* ASK
** You've done it: I spend time randomly looking at plantlife on purpose. Thank you. Maybe I'll be able to even identify native stuff some day.
** Doing shots of Ginger beer with you has been a highlight of my time with you. I like that we toast many times throughout. 
** You're doing a good job wrestling everything all at once. It's been hell, and you've survived.
** The workshop is coming along. It's a good idea.
** Thank you for helping me with the light fixture. 
** Planning an intentional community with you is both not a surprise and surprising (in different respects). I'm glad that we get to work toward similar ends together. It's my honor and privilege.
** Thank you for the delicious mediterranian food! 
** Grilling with you was a blast. I hope we get to do it many times many. 
*** Speaking of which, I think we should consider doing burgers and hotdogs sometime. 
**** Have you considered: kielbasa?
***** No. Let's do it.
** You're a talented problem-solver in a shocking variety of contexts. 
** I had fun gambling and crafting in [[D2]] with you, as well as working on and thinking about your assassin. 
** I am very glad you enjoy gaming with h0p3; he needs a gaming friend and I am not it.
** thank you for the plant, it's wonderful. :)
** You are definitly an engineer-maybe not a professional one, but an engineer.
*** Seconded. Yes. Absolutely. Agreed. HEAR HEAR. I'd add that: you're a hacker.
**** You, Sir, continue to give me the highest praise.
**** (i'm pretty sure it's "hear, hear", as in "hear what i'm saying")
