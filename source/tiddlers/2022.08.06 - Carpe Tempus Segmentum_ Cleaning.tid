title: 2022.08.06 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Cleaning

Sleep by 1? Woke at 7? I slept well and I'd argue enough too. //Skintime// with my sympaticon. Tomatoes, water. 

A flash.

[[D2]] + //Hyperion// @124:03:00. Found a Crown of Ages. First for me. T1 loot, yo. Have no real use for it. My sympaticon took down p8 dclone solo. Brix. I dislike our new bidet. It's too big. [[TTTOTW]].

Chilled with mi amor. She tired and "started" on cleaning. Laid down with me, //Skintime//, sleep. 

A flash.

Went outside to grab the reclining chair out of the beast with [[1uxb0x]] (his hands are sore from installing the bidet). He's gettin better at moving things. My sympaticon quickly found why it was thrown away (the covering is very worn, but that seemed a poor reason given how comfortable it is): the latch-pull mechanism is broken. Got the tools out, saw someone had tried to fix it, and tested to see if the rest of the mechanism worked. Just need to replace the wire and latch. Amazon-fu. $10 is quite reasonable. We couldn't get this for less than $100 at a thrift store here.

Mi amor doesn't want the liquor in her room, as she needs space for art supplies. Moving stuff. She came down to try the chair, since her rockingchair is probably dead at this point (it did its job for many years). She wants to sleep in it. Dope. Gotta see if it can fit in the nook.

Attempted to speak with [[Variety Creepy]] again. "Hi, hi, hi, hi, etc."

I did nap again. No idea for how long.

Mi amor put her room together piecemeal. Offspring did chores. [[ASK]] and tried out arrangements of [[The Den]]. Mi amor's seat fits now. Cleaning.

A wild [[MoebiusInfinity]] appears...

//Inform the Men!//

[[TTTOTW]]. Leftover kickasserole.

Snacks + Wine + //The Sandman//.

[[JRE]] called. Whole family got Covid. Wasn't horrific, but with two young ones sick, extra painful. Boys talking more, and [[Q]] doesn't listen at all at bedtime. Argument about haircutting, gender, consequentialism, a construct based on a performance whose lines are arbitrarily written by other people, hypocrisy, some problems in avoiding routines/habits, and [[Rb]] does not argue logically (and isn't persuaded by by it), picking our fights, and I laughed a lot.

[[TTTOTW]]. My daughter was able to get the dryer to stop working. Busted out our drying rack. [[D2]], hardcore mode with my sympaticon. A few levels. //The Sandman// with my sympaticon. Sleep by midnight.
