When I "pray on it," then you automatically don't get to criticize me for it ([[ITS]], of which, I assure you, I am praying upon).

When you argue with me, you aren't arguing with a person, you're arguing with a wall-of-text stitched together from stock phrasing and cliche memes. There's nothing genuine, new, or relevant about it.

Dasein lives in metanarratives. There's no intentionality without it. There is no valuelessness in a driven consciousness, though we can be radically inaccurate. We beg the question of meaning in getting out of bed in the morning, and it's our plight to do it well. My metanarrative is that it's metanarratives all the way down into metanarrativity itself.

Claiming to be against authoritarianism without taking the time to define it, justify what's wrong with it, or describe both permissible political coercion and the criterion of authority of even a hypothetical justified government is likely empty rhetoric (at best).
