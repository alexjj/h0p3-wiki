title: 2022.01.12 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Tense

[[TTTOTW]]. Brain hurts. SC2. //Raw Skintime// with [[ASK]] while she's sleeping. Calmly gasping for unconsciousness, woven into extra-insomniac [[TTTOTW]], with bouts of tense sleep (I believe). 

Son's appointment was a clusterfuck. Wrong address, parking was difficult, actually crossed into a gas station in the wrong direction (it was too late to do anything about it) and a pig giggled `/nod`. Unfortunately, being even a little bit late meant the appointment didn't happen. Fek. End of the month then. Sorry.

Prepped dinner while the gang had TableTime. Chill window is closed for pie, so pie will be for tomorrow, perhaps. [[TTTOTW]].

Finished making dinner with [[ASK]]'s [[help]]. 

A surprise message from [[ALM]]. [[Awe]]some.

[[Family Gathering]] sans [[k0sh3k]]. //Aggretsuko//. I wasn't hungry. We had asha noodles, softboiled eggs, and sauteed mushrooms. Spent most of the time thinking about [[ALM]].

Talking with [[ASK]]. Thinking about [[ALM]]. We kept rabbitholing through our histories.

Went to finishing making the lemon meringue pies from scratchish. Shit, we used up more eggs than we thought for dinner, and the cartons we had left were not as filled as we thought. I thought about asking before, but I didn't. I should have. Anyway, put it away, and maybe tomorrow. We'll get some eggs. Lemon zest smells really good. 

Hugs'n'bugs, good nights, and I [[love]] you's with everyone.

[[TTTOTW]]. Vapelyfe.

//The Walk// with [[ASK]]. Double pants, jacket, coat, gloves, hand-warmers, muh skullcap, 2 hoods, scarf, and I decided to take my glasses off so I could see. Talked hard and fast.
