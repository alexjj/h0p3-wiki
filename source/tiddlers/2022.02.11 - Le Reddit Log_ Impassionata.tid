Thank you for writing them. I ask you to consider how the pre-Christ memeplex that evolved toward representing the reality of [[The Good]] is a rich, complex philosophical topic, and one that played a non-trivial role in enabling us to even have a New Testament at all. I'd like you to meet my [[Root User]], Sir [[DeathOfRobinhood]], one day. `/salute`.

No. I think that because you define what I said as 'being a good person,' for you specifically 'good' is defined with the Christian ethos. You function as a Christian because of what you believe is good.

In the days before Christ that which was 'good' was that which benefited the tribe or the myriad gods. Christ transforms the moral landscape so that it is possible to think of a good person as one who does good works for humanity.

Any analysis of Christianity beyond that is a sort of modern anachronism. Christianity operates in this primal way where its permanent effects are made invisible, and you hardly even notice that the way you define 'good' corresponds pretty exactly to this Christian ethos as you reject, rightly, the modern mega-churches, Buddy Christ, and evangelical fundamentalism.

I often find that people are atheists because they are Christian, because they have such a strong moral center.

And this goes deeper than being a 'cultural Christian' who continues to celebrate Christmas or whatever. It's a deeply axiomatic thing. This is the power of the Living Word of Christ.
