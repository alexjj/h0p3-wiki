As a deist or atheist (I don't care which label you pick out): I will not persecute anyone for loving Jesus, but I will hold everyone accountable for not seriously applying his philosophy to the best of their abilities. Let me know if his teachings actually offend you (most self-styled Christians, reactionaries, and progressives may inquire within).

One of the classic strawmen of "religion" accuses the zealot of viciously claiming "as I believe, so must you." Obviously, we should talk about justified epistemic systems (let's do, please). Who doesn't actually take up that position about something in practice? Most really mean to say they don't want to have to deal with someone else's expectations while engaging in malicious fundamental misattribution errors. To what objective theory will you point? Are you simply emoting, or do you really think it's wrong for anyone to impose their views on others? Are there any cases where we ought impose our views on others? Can you really have zero causal affect on others in this respect? I don't abide by that hypocrisy.

Show me ur titties, and I'll show you my crackhead kungfu action figurines and pog fetish collection. Unironically: poggers. Slam it. Ham 2 Face. Smell our appendages. Simp and slurp straight mayo birth stew together. Attach the dildo unicorn, put on blast, and spank those cheeks so hard they look like ears. I always keep one in each pipe for you, baby. Yes, I will wear a keepsake of your discharge around my neck. Cum choke me, m'theydy. Note, I only produce purebred retard babies. You may pay for my vasovasostomy, but don't come at me with cheap offers for this minimonkedick (it will scratch the itch of your yeast infection tho, promise). That would be scandalous. 

<br>

If you ask me for the truth, I should be allowed to tell you that your baby is ugly (and I love your baby). Else, I'm no longer going to tell you your fly is down: I'm just going to zip it up for you. And, of course, remember that I'm only going to consent to interacting insofar as you consent to me interacting in bad faith. I'm not a fan of mere rhetoric or cheapshots, esspecially if you aren't willing to go down the rabbithole. Relatedly, don't ask questions you aren't willing to argue for hours about it, especially if you haven't and won't try to find the answers on your own (let alone present your solutions in public). If we aren't here to ask questions, then what are we here for?

<br>

Stop looking wrong and stop looking at me wrong. Looking at me wrong is looking wrong. When confronted, I'll claim I don't really believe in wrongness outside of my own subjective desires. But, the way this normally works when we aren't being reflective is: you exist to understand all my desires without me having to understand yours, and we here to be guided by whatever makes me happy.

<br>

When you ask if something makes me feel less of an X, it can make me feel less of an X. Whether or not that makes me less of an X is usually another matter.

It's hard for us to learn to commune together online. Online communities are very drawn. It' s hard to actually commune where th elines blur together and peoiple know each otgher thoroughly. We're making our offline communities more like our online communities. Without generational families we are atomized. Likewise, in neighborhoods that aren't communities, we don't commune. I think Gen Z is trying to fix that. All Hail Gen Z! They are doing it online with shared stories that would blow your minds, and may they do so in the streets as well.
