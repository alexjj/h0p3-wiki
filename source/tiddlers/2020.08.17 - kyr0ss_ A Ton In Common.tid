It's an honor to meet you! Let me know if I can [[help]] [[you|kyr0ss]]. I'm curious about your [[name]]. I'd like to know what it means to you. You will have to forgive me for caring about [[aesthetics]], but I'm a fan of 1337 names.<<ref "n">> Like Sir [[gh057]], maybe even as a light-hearted shibboleth, it already makes me feel like you are a part of my family.<<ref "a">>

<<<
Hello h0p3,

I don't usually reach out to people on the internet. I know i should, but I don't. I chose to contact you mainly to express my gratitude for your work. 
<<<

Well, I'm glad you did. I'm [[grateful]] to make [[friend]]s, and it's humbling to see that my work can be useful to [[others]]. Thank you for telling me. You'll have to forgive me for being incredibly slow. I can read quickly enough in some cases, but I find writing isn't generally so simple for me.

<<<
It's been a month since I discovered your wiki, I think a guy on reddit mentioned it, and I study it ever since.
<<<

This is how I know you are truly a madman[[²|2019.06.25 - DeathOfRobinhood: The Chickenscratch Confession Booktour]]<<ref "2">>. (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞ ☜(ﾟヮﾟ☜). Most of the unfortunate souls who look at this pile of a wiki run for the hills, understandably.<<ref "i">>

<<<
I was a TW user long time ago, and I had trouble organizing my thoughts for years, changing tools, but never realized the true power of a wiki.
<<<

I think it's fair to say we are all working on organizing our thoughts. Imho, that's what it's like to do philosophy. I cannot say I understand the [[power]] or implications of hypertext. I know I've poured some serious work into this [[monster]], but it still feels like I'm just scratching the surface. I'm glad we get to be apprentices together.

What other tools seemed to have a [[sparkle|Gems]] for you?

<<<
My wiki is not public, I'm too introvert to do something like your project, plus I don't write so nice as you (come on, after all you're a philosopher) since English is not my mother language.
<<<

I appreciate the pull of introversion ([[PSM]] goes against a number of my instincts), especially for having spent much of my life minimizing how much I revealed of myself to almost anyone. In case you change your mind, I know some people maintain a public-face of their wiki (tagging it <<tag "Public">>would allow you to export it out into a public wiki), and that may be a worthwhile way to approach it.

<<<
I copied lots of your mechanics, like reviews, TDLs and hubs because I think they're brilliant. I hope you don't mind.
<<<

Nope, I don't mind (and, I don't think I would be justified if I did<<ref "s">>). I'm hard-pressed to think of anything of mine that isn't at least partially a mimetic copy of something else. I consider it an honor that I would have anything worth re-using. 

Which mechanics seem to work best for you so far? I would like to know how you to do it differently too. I am lucky to learn from others in this space. For example, Madame [[Sphygmus]] has her own approaches that I study, and it's a joy to be able to think about what we're doing in these machines with her.

<<<
I like the fact that you built your wiki to be deciphered by reading different pieces, catching the rhythm of your thinking which is so hard. I can't appreciate your texts like I should because I have so many unknown words, but I catch the feel of them.
<<<

I have been thinking about this line. It goes in many directions for me. I fear I should give you a disclaimer here: in some sense, I require a dictionary to speak with, and even most English speakers will agree that I often don't express well-formed formulas. My wife read your words and laughed: she half-jokes that only someone who isn't a native English speaker would believe I have anything coherent to say within this maze. I am moved that even if the words were unknown that the feeling and general expression (even more than style) might still bleed through. I hope you will forgive me for not understanding you as well you understand me in some surprising cases, and I'm glad we have the chance to ask for clarification. The more I engage in [[FTO]], the more I'm obligated to say: I can't say I understand what you are saying, but I'm still listening. It becomes clearer and clearer to me how little I understand about the other people in the world. It feels like it's never sufficient. <<tag "Speaking In Tongues">>is practically a matter of [[Faith]] for me.<<ref "es">> Translating ourselves and the world (including the fictions) into symbols will always be our plight to some [[dok]]. Even I don't know what I'm saying too often.<<ref "z">> (´༎ຶ ͜ʖ ༎ຶ). I work to maintain the [[awe]] [[The Other]] inspires in me; it is a source of [[hope]].

<<<
I am also a linux user, a father, concerned about online privacy, writing journal entries and creating software toolboxes. I'm so happy about my wiki and for the fact that I don't have to customize my emacs anymore.
<<<

We obviously have a ton in common. I don't have the privilege of meeting many fathers that share my interests. How long have you been using Linux? What are your preferences in that space?<<ref "p">> If you can say, how many [[children|Be A Good Dad]] do you have? Do they enjoy [[computers]] like their old man?

I'm a huge fan of Tox, btw, if you ever want to [[chat|Contact]] realtime with me. I don't provide much [[privacy]], but I'm happy to help you maintain your anonymity. 

It's awesome that you are both an emacs and TW user. My senpai, [[chameleon]], is also skilled in both, like you. I am benignly envious, lol. It is my wish that my offspring will learn to master both tools.<<ref "r">> I often consider my wiki "just a bunch of textfiles" that I unflatten from different perspectives. I'm excited to get to understand what you do about this tool. 

<<<
Thank you for your work.👍
<<<

You're welcome, sir. I'll try to keep it up.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
