"""
[2:34:45][Tzino] I would defintely bring songs that would remind me of my childhood and my beloved ones or songs that I could visualize calm and peaceful situations.
[2:37:37][Tzino] So, what do you think is really going on in this life? What is the purpose? And what about the current age we live in? Why is there so much pain evil in general. Is this a mirror of ourselves? Or is it because of the metagaming of the Admins that we are programmed in some specific way.
[13:18:28][h0p3] I think we're to understand and serve what is outside ourselves. We aren't morally entitled to our own bodies and minds all the way down. As to [[The Telos]] of Humanity, I only have my own meager contribution from having listened to a lot of humans. A measure of pluralism and a measure of dogmatic intolerance is required. We need liquid democracy on a global scale, and that is no small task (including the continuous radical transfer of wealth from the wealthiest to the poorest).
[13:20:23][h0p3] Is what a mirror of ourselves? Do I think the spectacle before us is what we often crave? Yes. Do I think markets are at least partial reflections of the desires of competing egos (of varying degrees of [[power]])? Yes. It need not be a war of all against all, and, I'm [[lucky]] to know people who aren't really here to just serve themselves. They give me [[hope]].
[13:21:11][h0p3] I'll agree that we are programmed, though not deterministically, and I think there is quite a bit up to us. Cooperation is a hard problem.
[13:22:36][h0p3] I do think we can program the basic Rawlsian structures of society to serve those in most need. I think the criterion of authority of The State can be generated in a largely P2P fashion on hardware owned by the people. 
[13:23:34][h0p3] I'm not terribly optimistic about any of the options I've seen so far. Too few people workin' on the right projects. Not hopeless, but I think there's room for practical despair. 
[13:24:04][h0p3] How about you, my friend? So, what do you think is really going on in this life? What is the purpose? And what about the current age we live in? Why is there so much pain evil in general. Is this a mirror of ourselves? Or is it because of the metagaming of the Admins that we are programmed in some specific way.
