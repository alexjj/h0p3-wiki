title: 2021.11.23 - Prompted Introspection: The Downward Spiral

!! What's your story and and how have you learned to embrace it? Where did your story take a sudden turn?

⦗ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱: h0p3⦘ tries to do that already. It's pretty difficult to narrow it down.<<ref "i">> I'm an outsider. I take myself to be still learning to embrace it. I have so many turns in my story, I'm not sure which one to pick out here. These aren't dumb questions (they're icebreakers), but they aren't intended for a context in which someone has already given some fairly thorough answers. 

Having fun with it: main got nerfed after losing mind, mane. Pre-nerf memory was dope. Puberty was quite a change. Everything after 1996 has been going at lightspeed, jumbled, make no sense, etc.

2021 has been a helluva year though. I feel very different this year, and it may be among the best years of my life (if not the). I think that is due to having the luxury of embracing the kind of retard that I am though, accepting my place, etc. I continue to owe Sir [[DeathOfRobinhood]] a debt of [[gratitude]] for a [[wrestling]] that has allowed me to begin letting go.<<ref "o">>
