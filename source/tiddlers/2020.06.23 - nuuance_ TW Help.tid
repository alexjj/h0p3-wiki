heyy there "Tiddlywiki is dope. I could not live without mine. Let me know if you would like help setting one up."
thanks so much :) appreciate the help. Would love to hear your implementation & share any ideas if useful ones come to me. Hopefully i can help streamline your system even more

Yo!
I use TW5-Bob for my development environment.
https://philosopher.life/#RGM
I have several backup/versioning methods (use different kinds for different jobs).
There's some scripting I use underneath (and through TW5-Bob's synchronization), but my goal is to build the system inside of the wiki as much as possible. It's a quine.

Thanks for asking, yeah just trying to get back on the daily routine thing & stop putting off shit. Working on a novel & some unorthodox analysis vids, main reason for trying to implement a good Zettelkasten setup
Admittedly your blogs going wayyy over my head hahah I can’t even pretend to know the first part about that

Cool, what are you analyzing?
I can appreciate why you'd want a good Zettelkasten setup (and more) for analysis.
Don't worry, my hypertext is unfortunately a crazy mess with a terrible entrance. It's probably worth exploring for a while for ideas, especially if you will use TW as your technical base upon which you perform the Zettelkasten method.
One of the great strengths of TW is that it allows you to fruitfully evolve your methods without knowing exactly where you were going or how to get there. You may find the Zettelkasten only solves a subset of the problems you are looking at.
What platform(s) do you use, and what saving method have you been thinking about for TW?

Essentially a lot of existential & philosophical points that are all connected in some way. Along w/films & a favorite show of mine that’ll eventually funnel those ideas into the book as well
So it’s all connected. But I like Zettelkasten because it works like I think & for when you’re thinking/working in flow it seems great
Tbh tho idk howwww to even begin exploring your page lol & I’m unfamiliar with TW I gotta lookitup a bit
