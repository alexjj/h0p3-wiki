title: Seeking Sphygmus

//Here I wander and follow the pulsing fractal light. Seek and weave.//<<footnote "ᛝLightᛝ" "I don't even know where to begin with this page. By the end of 2018, it was already in motion. I've never understood well enough why this page should exist, but I'm glad it does. I want to be with you. I want to be built with you. I don't think I could even admit it myself; this must have been my subconscious pushing through, trying to make it explicit. Call it repression (you didn't do it). I'm glad I mustered up the courage finally, even if it's too late.">>
