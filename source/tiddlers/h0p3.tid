You should never settle for ~~you who are~~ who you are.

We can't really change who we are anyway, right?

It has gradually become clear to me what every great philosophy up till now has consisted of – namely, the confession of its [[originator|The Good]], and a species of involuntary and unconscious autobiography.

This is a page literally about me, [[h0p3]].<<ref "ih">> If I were cool enough to have a title it would be: ⦗[[h0p3]]⦘ the Honest Heretic<<ref "hr">> or [Autism.exe Incarnate]. Perhaps you are thinking: isn't that what both this ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 in general and {[[About]]} purport to be?<<ref "1">> Why the aporetic redundancy? 

I can't quell these fears, and even worse, I'm going to temporarily set aside the objection without any justification beyond the claim: this page exists because my gut is convinced I need this page. I can't quite see why yet, but I hope I will. I don't know what the future holds here. For now, I'm going to play it Loosey-Goosey and go with the flow.

As usual, most of this is impolite to say about oneself. It comes off as [[arrogant]], lacking in humility, deceptive virtue signaling, dark-triadic, or cryptically self-important. But, guess what? My life is important to me. I want it to mean something, even if it only means something to me. I might not be doing a good job of it, but I'm at least trying. I'm wandering, throwing off my unjustified dogmatic yokes, and doing my best to find the truth in the desert.

I believe most people would despise what I'm trying to do, what I aspire to be, what I think I'm engaging in, precisely because they are scared of it. I must move past their judgment. It's okay. I will not take myself lightly (laughing at oneself is serious bidness too). I may never succeed, but I will not give up. My goal is to become a [[Eudaimonic Lifehacker]]. 

Let's see what I can do.

!! Principles:

* Capture the brief version of your psychology here.<<ref "i">>
* Develop elevator speeches for who you are.
* Stop hiding your power level; bask in your strong point of view.
* Listen to your [[Root Users]].
* [[ITS]], don't forget to tell everyone you use Arch Linux.
* Unironically, talk about the meaning of life, [[salience]], God, and theories of everything with anyone and everyone you can.
* Learn to thrive in isolation too.
* Be a committed self-keylogger of even what little virtue you can muster, retard.
* Become a [[Leet]] copycat skiddie, a mere footnote to [[Humanity]], sir.
* 🙫
* My job as a professional schizoid is to figure out what I'm doing, including what I'm supposed to be doing. 
* Enjoy your borrowed time and hopium addiction, sir. You're a true believer.
* I<3U2 ἐλπίδα
* beep/boop

!! Focus:

* h0p3 is:
** seeking to eat, sleep, fuck, vape, push brix, watch, listen, read, write, walk, and talk. I am a simple man. 
** a grumpy, agitated, imbalanced, confrontational, disgrunted, unhinged, unkempt manlet robotic imageboard neckbeard nailbiting simp with halitosis, deadly fart streams, wild eyebrows, and an extravagant [[masturbation]] life. 
** at least a biological computer based on axioms and ruled by laws.
** an honorary Gen-X xellennial, Amerimutt, highly-educated, working class, cosmopolitan.
** the husband of [[k0sh3k]], father of [[j3d1h]] and [[1uxb0x]], `/this` of [[ᛝLightᛝ]], and `/that` of [[ASK]]
** a pipefitter, teacher, amateur computer scientist, Arch Linux user (oh yas, you know [[itdo]], bitch), god-tier wiki-ricer, philosopher, recovering academic, and ~~Glowy Artistic Researcher~~ ~~Recursively LARPed Gotcha Gonzo Journalist~~ twinking-the-[[other]] undercover digital street epistemologist.
** however incompetent, unironically: grey hat computer zealot, cybertankie socialist freedom fighter, class-war veteran, dirtbag [[pleft]] culture warrior, monkeywrenching domestic terrorist candidate, renegade thinker, culture jammer & conduit, guerrilla librarian, digital monastic, cognitive public servant & emotional laborer, and an underground twinked-out smurf.
** Geschwind Syndromic, autistic, schizophrenic, depressed, anxious, obsessive, emotionally scarred, lonely, the only man who could steer his hermitic and hermetic car, hikikomori, entangled in a volatile fight-flight-freeze-or-fuck response cycle toward the world, endlessly collecting and connecting dots.
** a poor, socially defeated, atopos, broken man, and a box of contradictions, with few options, a chip on his shoulder, and a bleak outlook.
** an empathetic reality junkie, cynical skeptic, (moral perfectionistic) idealist, contemplative psychonaut, and introspectionist with a sensitive moral compass.
** an extreme all-the-spoons slowpoke, versatile yet rigid homiesexual queer, smoothbrained-bigcoomer, prefer your weight on me (like any decent 'tist), & completely incompetent (I hope you are into clowns,<<ref "cl">> [[missdirection|Miss Direction]], and disappointment, lil'mistress).<<ref "fs">> 
** a hermetic hermit lost in the desert, voraciously hungry for mythemal fruits from the Trees of Life and Knowledge, wrestling with himself and the transcendental.
** seeking to be as excellent as practically possible, integrated, well-constituted, unified, empathic, authentic^^tm^^, knowledgeable, enlightened, justified, useful and productive, acceptable if not worthy, and happy.
** an Externalist, Platonist, Marxist, Rawlsian, Computationalist, Mystic, existential-skiddie, moral-tool picker, avowed generalist specializing in [[salience]]
** finding himself; finding [[h0p3]]. Living up to names.
** stuck in a while loop objectifying himself and his [[phenomenology]].
** According to...
*** his daughter: a shadow dogkin cuck system from the 1900s (ancient), dotard, and tyrant.
*** some folks (including sometimes himself): a bot, a virtual circus 4eak, [spearchucker, yakshaver, & phisher], stalker, pervert, schizopoet, dilettante, tabloid crank, coldreader, condescending faggot, zugzwanger, evangelist, HQ-shitposter, reality reverse engineering sperg, and neurotribally alien human being who likes most people less and less the more he gets to know them.
*** Tinder: personality-h0p3/personality-h0p3's, low sausage to bread ratio, room smells of body odor and quiet desperation, sitting in the dark with many bottles, deconstructing [[silence]] [[itself]]
