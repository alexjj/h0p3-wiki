I want to see patchworks of P2P networks that use DHT, geographic routing, social routing, and others at each applicable layer.

Why don't we have moral revolutionary mathematicians like Terrance Howard (who believe 1x1=2) teaching their diverse perspectives on mathematics? Oh, you want to discriminate between right and wrong types of discrimination, right? How are you going to do that? A significant percentage of people with a persecution fetish have no defense beyond their own subjective, egoistic perspective, and they deny the truth obtains external to them. I meet plenty of Nazis who worship themselves too. You've gotta give at least an intersubjective answer. Otherwise, your opinion is likewise functionally no better than merely a spook. "This is an inclusive society, and if we feel you are talking, thinking, or behaving in a non-inclusive way, you will be excluded" picks out the paradox we must resolve: how can we fairly and collectively define what or who is actually worth excluding and why? Not all perspectives are equal or equally justified. We must select [[salience]] together, and we also have to admit it is not merely in pursuit of our own subjectivities; the answer is still external even to the intersubjective.

Apparently, you're a fuck up when people aren't upset with you but instead themselves for ever believing in you.

When not circle-jerking, humanities scholars are often, at best, engaged in an apology for their queer views, admitted to the quorum on grounds that maintain some other general paradigm until they don't. It's hard to find systematic views though; they are discouraged, and not merely due to specialization costs.

If you think anti-vaxxers are child-manslaughterers (or even murderers), and that's a fair claim in many cases, then consider the rest of our causal relationships to the deaths of children worldwide. There's way more blood on our hands than people are willing to recognize. I can't believe I have to say this: this isn't a what-aboutism, that's a bad thing, and it's wrong too.
