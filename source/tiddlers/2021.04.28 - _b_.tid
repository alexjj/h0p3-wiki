One interesting part of the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 is that there's a very narrow scope of questions one can ask me that demonstates someone is actually trying to help me rather than someone else. I'm very glad to receive questions. I wish my answers were better.

Why should we think predictive accuracy can be gauged well enough in turing complete spheres? Bayesianism is necessary but insufficient; it cannot be the sole basis of knowledge (must we continue to repeat this lesson?), which is not to say reliable indication isn't fundamental. Isn't a strict empiricist forced to accept that [[phenomenology]] is king, reduced to internalism despite their kicking and screaming parade of laying claim to the title of externalism? You have to be openly engaged in metaphysics to coherently call yourself an externalist in the end. A True Scientist's Skepticism^^tm^^ never allows for escape velocity from solipsism, and that will always be the pressure point they don't want to reveal to anyone, including themselves.

Our family is both high cultural context and low in some respects. Given our autism(s), we tend to emphasize literality, precision, and concision, expecting more than most in our verbal exchanges. But, we also have a lot of non-verbal signaling, tons embedded in past interactions, and a stranger would be largely lost (they usually are). My daughter says it's like we speak another language entirely, even though it is technically English. This reminds me of the manner in which very capable non-native speakers of English seem to understand me about as well as similarly intelligent native speakers, and the only people who seem to do better than both have spent a lot of time studying a variety of subjects (there's a cluster of knowledge required to interpret the microculture). I guess I'm lost on how to really divide high and low contexts in the end.
