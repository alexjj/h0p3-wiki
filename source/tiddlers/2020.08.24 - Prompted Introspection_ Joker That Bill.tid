!! How would you feel if you were going to be on a show?

Sometimes I think this wiki is some version of a [[ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱]] //Truman Show//. The feels vary widely (surprise!). Obviously, it depends on the show, what I'm doing on the show, and many other factors. As an autist, I would make a terrible actor, unless I'm playing an autist. No, it would be better to have me on some other kind of "non-fiction" show. I'd enjoy having a conversation with many T.V. personalities, or, I think it could be fruitful. I don't imagine that Bill O'Reilly and I would get along for very long.<<ref "t">> I'd still like to see how he reacts to me realtime: it would tell me something. Plus, I think his "fuck it, let's do it live" homocide would be fantastic. So, maybe a little bloodthirsty too? Naw. I'm sure I would be reserved. Offer the man the chance to not be a piece of shit, in vain, surely. Not worth my time. I think I would find it to be a waste of my time. Screw that, I want to be in //Rick & Morty//. Chuck Based Elon out of that atrocious episode and allow me to sperg out instead. Wincest Dragon Orgies sound pretty reasonable too.
