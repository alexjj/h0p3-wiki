* The strongest reason to advocate a libertarian society is that such advocacy follows from a respect for individual rights.
* Individuals are self-owners; they have rights to their lives, liberty, and the fruits of their labor.
* We would not want to live as plugged into a machine that would give us pleasurable experiences; what we desire is to live ourselves, in contact with reality.
* The endorsement of the imposition of sacrifices on individuals for social good fails to recognize the status of individuals as ends-in-themselves.
* Just outcomes are those arrived at by the separate just actions of individuals; a particular distributive pattern is not required for justice.
* The various programs of the modern liberal welfare state (e.g. taxation) are immoral because they make slaves of the citizens of such a state.
* The only sort of state that can be morally justified is a "minimal state" which protects individuals from force via police and law, but does nothing else.
* Knowledge is true belief that tracks the truth by varying according to the state of things in close possible worlds.
