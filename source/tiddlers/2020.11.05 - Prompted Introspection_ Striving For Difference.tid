title: 2020.11.05 - Prompted Introspection: Striving For Difference

!! How do you strive to be similar to, or different from, your parents?

Boooo! This question is painful. Fuck you, Samwise. <3. There are some similar questions:

I'll go with a difference this round. I've worked hard and sacrificed a great deal to provide a real education to my offspring from the beginning, and one that includes an openness to perspectives wildly different from and even opposed to their parents' beliefs and desires. Of course, I think there's significant value to wrestling with me. Since before I watched them come out of their mother, I have sought to help them become philosophers. The results have been hard to argue with, [[WINTCIS]].<<ref "t">> I can't say they are much happier (and given my projections for the future, I can see why), but they aren't gaslit, they are far more aware of themselves, and their models of the world have a depth and accuracy that even most adults I've encountered lack. I am hoping that surprises in their lives will tend to be happier ones, in part, because I've prepared them for the worst as best I know how.

I think the explosion of intelligence and intensity of exposure to some awful truths has been traumatizing, but I think the pain is worth it here. I suggest they will strongly appreciate a shared experience of lacking, insufficiency, incompleteness, and incoherence, as that may be the thing that unites us. I think they have cause for [[hope]] in some dark, deep, and vertiginous places too. For their ages, I think they have some pretty leet starter tools, skills, languages, experiences, and intuitions. I don't know where they are going with what they have, and I'm still scared.<<ref "m">> They'll also have to choose to do something with what they've been given, and that one isn't up to me. I do not claim to have done a good job, but I think it's a sufficient one. They will have to be the primary judges of that.
