title: 2021.06.26 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Maddog Flirt While Tonguing My Icecream Voodoo Proxy, Respectfully

Fireman Time! Fruit. They were still up and failed to complete the task. Onto it. [[TTTOTW]]. Fell asleep at 5? IDK. Think I woke at 2? 

//Inform the Men!// Shower of the gods. Assignments. Enough forgiveness: my daughter lost her phone and headphones for the day. Continued annoyance that she must obey if she doesn't have an argument. 

Planted the new Pawpaws (these actually have leaves). Can't hold a conversation with Scott to save my life; not terribly interested in getting close to a someone who owns a sporty police vehicle. Met a new neighbor, Markus, small family, disappointed that we got the house instead of his sister-in-law, adding more fencing, including along our property lines, a garden, more chickens, he's articulate. We found a lot of glass underground. =/. 

Adults chillin'. Thinking about what to do for her compute sitcheeayshun again. Desktop hasn't been touched (though she's been quite busy). Not convinced she wants to be down with me so extensively, not convinced that monitor swivel and other work to make the desktop operate cleanly on the couch is worthwhile, and she doesn't want anything clunky in her lap. The laptop she would want simply costs too much, so she's stuck on an underpowered primary device.

Did prep for my wife's meal. 

[[Family Gathering]]. Baked plantains, a chili-like gravy, watermelon, water. Simple meal together. Son and I talked about different projects to engage in. He's thinking about working on the [[Pinephone]] with me. It was nice to hear from him that he thinks I've exceptionally fair.

Officially have a Tiktok account to give their recommendation engine another test drive. Let's see what months of minor collection does. I forgot just how good my taste is. How fast will they peg me, as a degenerate? Good praxis makes me horny. Also, holy god, simpin for thots, flood me, mammamia. I'll admit that 50 [[vidya]]s already shows vast improvement. I don't have a reasonable hypothesis about which of these I should not like given the algo, but I am shooting for high rewatchability. As usual, 5% disappear a year. This is a pure consumption machine. Lawd. Checking every 50 or so. No predictions of new stuff I adore (not that I would predict it would), but it has shown me a few I've seen before (from a third-party host, they almost guaranteed could not know). Wondering how much traffic from my household's IP affects this (if so, I'm going to ruin your curator :P). More recommendations that aren't English than default. Still not going to follow; that requires skin in the game (but, omg, I am tempted to follow that @lyleforever geckofucker). I feel so much better about the existence of [[Humanity]] watching these fucking videos, but this is an absolute drug. There's something to be said for having the initial view, then letting it sit in your browser, and coming back to decide if it fits the [[Link Log]], and then, essentially, taking yet another filtering pass over it in this kind of process. Too many pets. There's a single video that popped up that might be worthy thus far. I wonder if they are weighting my inputs lower given factors like how far I'm into the video and how quickly I'm plowing through. It also looks too random and doesn't use their own engine; I'm seeding it in a way that it's not designed for. So far, it's still worse than [[Plebbit]]. Owning my data here, a minimal sense, at least, but I don't predict that it would be nearly as likely to be useful to transfering to other platforms as [[Music: Library]]. Searching by a partial meme-by-song has been weaksauce. Even after improvement (and I fed it plenty of signal), the feed is still not worth using. =/. I need hoomins.

Back to school next week. Schedules have to be righted.

Quesadillas, watermelon, vapyelyfe, LolVod.
