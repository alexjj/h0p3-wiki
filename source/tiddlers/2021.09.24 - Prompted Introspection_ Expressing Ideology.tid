title: 2021.09.24 - Prompted Introspection: Expressing Ideology

!! Do you have any political or social opinions that you're afraid to express to your friends?

Ideology, or [[faith]], permeates everything we do and say. Expression //is// political, and there may be some element of fear in any political expression, even to oneself or one's friends. There are many ways to express political opinions, some more fear-inducing than others, and self-censorship is not necessarily a good thing. I work hard to express my political opinions in this ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱, to my friends, enemies, and anyone else. My friends know at least the outlines of what I think, even if it is largely a pile of gibberish that they must forgive their retard for uttering (my [[Root Users]], in particular, are quite patient with me). I think it's fair to say I'm still afraid to express my opinions in many respects,<<ref "a">> but I try to be fearless, especially because I think I'm obligated to do so. 

However, I will often avoid speaking about aspects of these topics when I have the opportunity to engage my friends directly, especially in voice (where I think rhetoric, pathos, microexpressions, and the immediacy of the discussion pose problems to fairness in dialectics).<<ref "h">> It's not always a fitting direct topic given the context, and, in a sense, since I've already said my peace so thoroughly in this document, it's less obligatory to express it elsewhere (even though I think we should be wrestling about politics all the fucking time with each other). It's really fucking hard to get me to shut up about these topics though, and, to my eyes, there's always some element to it at work in any conversation I have (even about the dumbest fucking shit I can imagine). Further, I'm afraid that I'm so intense, extreme, and unpleasant that I'll ruin whatever moments of [[intimacy]] we have. I don't want to be intimidating, and I think this is a dangerous place in which to stand in the pocket with me.
