According to [[k0sh3k]], I only have such a faith in the written word (and obviously, even then, I'm extremely skeptical) because I know others don't even place faith in their own spoken word. If I could have faith in the verbal, I'd need less faith in the written word. It's the deniability and lack of accountability of the spoken word that underlies my strong reliance upon the written word. [[Gradual]] discipline needs a hard drive.

Of course, if your 3+ member community doesn't allow cross-platform lurking (often qua the web), I'm skeptical it's built morally (though there are many fitting reasons for [[privacy]]).

Anonymous access must be a first-class feature of any social media tool; that's part of being open.

(((tHeY))) store history. surely, history isn’t the story of what actually happened; it’s the story they want to believe!! form a conclusion (preferably one that suits your ego), try to find facts to fit your narrative, and if your narrative doesn't fit the facts, then never acknowledge the facts.

Intuition is a valuable form of private data that we can still attempt to represent, record, and model; and, I don't have a reason to think [[phenomenology]] should be reduced to intuition.
