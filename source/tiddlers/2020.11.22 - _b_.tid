Obviously, Dasein requires an ego to some [[dok]] just to engage in any existential experience. Insofar as the Buddhist's teaching does not exempt us from developing an objectively [[good]] self (and, of course, what consists in perfection is particular to our contexts [including our subjectivity] in no small part), I am often in agreement. [[Awe]] is not something I trust far enough, and I'm not a strict empiricist, however, I consider verifiable Reason to be a fundamental aspect of transcending one's ego (which is often simply awful rather an awesome). In our own character analysis, what is being defended, and why?
