!! What have you done that you are ashamed of?

That's a long list, Samwise. It's a difficult subject, no doubt. 

I've been ashamed of things that I ought not be ashamed of (one can be wrong here too, and perhaps even [[SO]] shameworthily so as well), but feelings aren't self-sufficient justifications. There are things that I ought have been ashamed of that I'm no longer ashamed of or //as// ashamed of (justifiably so in some cases), and this is often part of having an evolving persistent identity alongside some types of forgiveness.<<ref "j">> There are things I'm ashamed of that I think I should be ashamed of across my [[4DID]] as well. Further, and perhaps more unacceptably, there are things I should be ashamed of that I am not or wasn't fittingly either. Some consider shame from merely a positivistic, value-neutral, evolutionary signaling perspective alone (as though normativity were mere relativistic social constructions), but I consider it objectively obligated of [[fff]] creatures like myself.

Shame is a costly thing. Even from an egoistic perspective, there is self-service to having avoided shameworthiness, even and especially the kind that still applies while wielding the [[ROG]]. To the [[dok]] shame is rationally justified, it is through the recognition that at least a part of us is the prime sufficient cause of that which ought not exist, that part of us should not exist, that we ought not exist to some [[dok]] (but rather some of other version of us). Victims and the hole left in who we are after cutting out infection require healing, restoration, hedging, and other costs too.

Here's one: I used to be against abortion, and I held that belief unwisely. I considered it murder, and it shaped many things about how I saw the world. I tried to be consistently pro-life. I was against war, the death penalty, killing in self-defense, and purposely taking the life of Daseinic creatures without at least their direct informed consent with due cause (though I agreed to some forms of euthanasia). I have long understood that the best way to defeat abortion was contraception, ending poverty, real education, strong adoption processes, and empowering those who couldn't afford to have children otherwise. Among many things, I was wrong about violence, the beginning of personhood, and moreover, I didn't listen to my opposition well enough. Further, my fervor was not justified; I should have reasoned more and said less.

I had a friend and old next-door neighbor, Zhou, who had a surprise pregnancy many years ago. She was a Chinese Christian woman (her husband was a physicist, and she was an accountant, and they had just gotten back together) who had a son, Muyong (my son's playmate). She said she didn't want the baby, that it was not politically expedient for her given the one-child policy. She had misgivings about the abortion though given the [[faith]] we both had. She asked for my counsel, and I told her that I thought it was murder and that her reason wasn't a good one (we talked for several evenings; it wasn't a short discussion). She ended up keeping her baby because of my argument. She named her daughter Grace, and she thanked me after her daughter was born. At the time, I was pleased by that, but now I look back in horror, sadness, and shame. While I am glad that no obvious harm came about, and while I'm glad Grace lives and her family is happy: I obviously do not merit thanks. Not all of my argument was incorrect, but too much of it was, and especially the core claim was not justified. I was [[arrogant]] for what I said to her, this thing that would alter the rest of her life so intensely (and more). Shamefully, I bordered on behaviorally shaming her without justification. I am not in a position to ask for forgiveness there; locally, she'd be glad that I did the wrong thing.

I [[hope]] to be more careful. I am not allowed to not have an opinion about big questions in life. I'm not allowed to say or do nothing about big problems. I [[hope]] to be less reckless and more epistemically humble. Zeal and precision never seem to be enough.
