title: 2021.05.28 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: W-Entity

Finished my call with [[chameleon]]. [[TTTOTW]]. Made a pizza. [[TTTOTW]]. Could not stay awake, though I wanted to keep grinding. Sleep by 4:30?

Woke at noon. Deep dreams into meditation. Bed is comfy. [[TTTOTW]]. 

//The Walk// with offspring was excellent. Dialecture and rabbitholing. My daughter is teasing me a lot more. =). I only remember a slice: index funds, concepts of ownership in legal systems, types of stocks, voting problems in markets (back to index funds). I'm having a much harder time remembering where I am in the rabbithole. 

Worked with my offspring on [[The Proxy Cube]]. I want to pick up the pace, but I think we should just take it slow. Maybe it will take a couple months to get it sorted. Their handwriting is marginally improving in quality, but their speed is where I've seen the biggest gains.

Called [[JRE]] back. Definitely stick to this job, which is excellent. Strong split between the racists/classists and the surprisingly sane/well-read/kind folks. It's a much slower-paced, self-guided position. He's learning a lot on the job. [[Rb]] is off for maternity leave in virtue of the adoption, but obviously they really needed it on the initial placement. Hole in his new deck. =(. More communication from his boys. He's tired, not sleeping enough, and he's horny too (good sign). Worried about diabetes, two episodes. 

Took my daughter to W-Entity with the car, but no one showed. It gave us plenty of time to talk though, and I'm glad we have this opportunity to think together. We aren't in a rush. 

//Skintime// and just thinking. I think our world is stabilizing. Got lucky. Inform the Men! Meditation. [[TTTOTW]].

Took my son to W-Entity to pick up objects we needed, including for dinner. Conversation went poorly for a while, but it got better. Got to the self-checkout, and unfortunately, I discovered that I didn't bring my wallet (so used to getting it with my keys, but not using my keys today). I was unhappy. Luckily, we had some cash in the vehicle, enough to pick up what we needed to finish the basics of the meal. 

-0, +0 gobbos vs clampfinity with my son. He destroyed me. It wasn't even close. He did make some significant mistakes, but there's simply too many choices and tricks to pick up instantly. Excellent games. 

[[Family Gathering]]. We had brats, and I had a beer. It was delicious. We shot the shit, though there were a couple serious conversations. Imparting everything I've got. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Broski surfed and vaped downstairs with me. He did get the new position, and quit the old. Gonna keep hunting until he's got somewhat more reasonable bosses and environment. That makes sense to me.
