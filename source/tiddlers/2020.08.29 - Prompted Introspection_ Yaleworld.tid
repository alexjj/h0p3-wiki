!! Give your city (or town or region) a new name that reflects what type of place it is, and explain why you chose that name.

I'm new here. I'm not able to rename it because I don't really understand nearly enough. My [[phenomenological]] horizon is also quite small here. Suburb, city, and forests mix together here. There's rough parts of town, crazy rich parts of town, and lots in between; I can smell the reactionary scent coming off the people, but I also see signs of [[pleft]]ist [[hope]]. Per capita stats feel better here than anywhere else I've lived, and even the homeless or quasi-homeless have more options than I'm used to seeing. Naw, I really only see a small surface. The internet connection is strong, the weather has four real seasons, and Yale owns everything.

Yaleworld.
