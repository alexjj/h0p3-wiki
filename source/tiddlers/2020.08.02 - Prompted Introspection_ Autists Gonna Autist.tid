title: 2020.08.02 - Prompted Introspection: Autists Gonna Autist

!! What rituals do you have or hold?

I'm unhappy with my lack of a definition and analysis of the concept of a ritual (a laden word if I ever saw one) in [[2019.10.18 - Prompted Introspection: Rituals]], but I'm not sure what to say about it now either. That answer does pick out some basics though. My family and I have been working on our [[TTP]]s together as a ritual (started just a couple months after that [[prompt]] was written). In a sense, one of our rituals during [[Family Time]] has been the collective executive functioning necessary to shape and construct rituals, habits, and processes in our lives, [[WINTCIS]].

Escalating with my offspring to get them to do their work is practically a ritual at this point. That has been my life for almost a decade now. It was much, much easier when they were young children. Work wasn't so painful for them, and that made it less expensive for me too. Now, it's a grind for all of us. I'm glad we do it. I've never met anyone like them before.

There is a lot of chaos, uncertainty, and need for change in my life. My offspring grow, and not a lot of our rituals can crystallize. The world seems to move faster, and flexibility seems so necessary that we don't get to ritualize as we might like. Even [[Family Time]] gets shrunk and rushed when we are with other family.

Okay, I've got a ritual: I clean my asshole after I shit. The bidet makes this an almost holy holey experience. I flush to make sure there is no splash-up, and then I hold my balls with my left hand (they get saggier) and use a classic overlapping spray pattern to baptize my sweetheart with my right (water pressure heightens after the tank has filled with water). At the end, I just hold it on my asshole because it tickles me right. Afterward, I still use a swipe of toilet paper to dry off. I then lick my fingers clean and do 50 pushups while singing random songs (something about taking a shit makes me want to sing). I also try to make at least one disgusting joke each day, as this makes me happy. All of this is a ritual I use at least once a day. I hold it in high regard.
