title: 2021.11.22 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: axed me for a double entendre, so I gave it to her

<<<
Woke at ?? //Skintime// with [[ASK]]. [[TTTOTW]]. Prep for dinner tomorrow.

[[Family Time]] was [[awe]]some. Started at 3, and ended at 6? Vapelyfe. If you're not interested in telling your own stories or especially not connecting to the stories of [[others]], it's not a practice that will be fully appreciated. I'm glad to see my son consistently having something to say even without any significant intervention. May it go a long way for him, especially as an autist who will be so expensive for people to connect with that his writing may be the only way to do it. 

//Star Trek//, the reboot. I had a salad (leftover salad in those containers does a fine job). We all enjoyed it, of course. It's really well done. Ruhspec. //Skintime// with mi amor. 

//The Walk// with [[ASK]]. Vapelyfe. Two long route, then we tried a new one.

Finished //The Walk// with [[ASK]]. //Skintime//. Fireman Time! Sleep by 2:15.

Woke at 10:30. Neck hurts (wife blames it on my mattress, ofc). Meditation. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Hugs'n'bugs (daughter is unhappy, wasting her time). Bagel chips + cream cheese (champions, my ninja). [[TTTOTW]].

Son grabbed me. Man at the door. Another solar salesman. He said that by the 10th "Sir" I was stabbing him in the heart with the word.  `/grin`, `/nod`. You should not be lying to either of us, sir, and you know that. Walked him through his arguments (the gift of a gentle candid response), told him I understood that he's gotta survive, shot some shit, he thanked me for our conversation, fistbumps, ggwp.

[[TTTOTW]]. 

Offspring and I made dinner (well, as far as we could). Ranga and I [[shared]] some sardines. Cherry jam toast and mocha (gracias, mi amor, your coffee is dope). Offspring came down to grind, and [[5c0ut]] joined us too. [[j3d1h]] smoothed out [[ASK]]'s sidebar, and it should be significantly easier to wield it now; thinking about TOC/[[Hub]]/[[Root]]-based hierarchies. 

//The Walk// with my offspring was cut short. We made it to the end of the U-loop and went back home. Read part of my wife's app with them (immediate feedback requested). Unfortunately, it was piercing cold. I need long-johns (shit is expensive, yo...and, I'm just gonna keep kicking myself for not doing it sooner, I think). Went back to [[The Den]] to talk. Didn't make it through my daughter's day, but we talked plenty of ML for coding and art, Saint Kierkegaard, cargo test and the job of the engineer. 

[[TTTOTW]]. //One Piece// + //Skintime// with [[ASK]]. 

Wife grabbed me to get what she needs for the party tomorrow. Shopping @ Aldi with mi amor, but it turned out we didn't have to go. I'm glad we did though. SR seems to be enjoying her company, SL driving her a bit nuts (the extra space has been useful). There's a formal dinner party that I'm allowed to skip (thank god), but I almost accepted because I need to meet S. That woman has been kicking ass for us (mi amor is meant to replace her in a few years, but still...I owe her). 

Stripped down. Held her until she's warm. //Inform the Men//! Meditation. Shower of the gods!

[[Family Gathering]] was excellent, except I fucked up twice. I was late getting the potatoes and carrots in, and the carrots were non-trivially underdone (still reasonable to eat). Worse, however, is that I failed to check the seasoning I used, which [[ASK]] cannot have. We at least caught it before she put anything in her mouth. =/. She whipped something else up. We watched the low-functioning autistic game-addict episode of //House//. It's interesting watching with my son, as he knows how far he has come and the prices we have paid to get here. 

[[TTTOTW]].

My wife agreed that we should get her stuff tonight (since she didn't want me to make the trays, understandably). Shopping @ W-Entity with mi amor. Grabbed and gone. She's cute and cold, and I trolled her the entire time. Gas too. The gauge bauble aint working right, I think.

[[TTTOTW]] + seconds (destroyed). Dialectics with [[ASK]].
