* We cannot simply apply notions of mathematics and physics to the life sciences; we must think in terms of change, of development.
* Each species is an individual rather than a kind; the relationship between an organism and a species is that of part to whole, not member to kind.
* Since "Homo sapiens", like all species, is an individual and not a kind, there is no property that defines the essence of humanity.
* The logical empiricist analysis of reduction is not very instructive in the case of understanding the relationship between Mendelian and molecular genetics.
* The appropriate levels in biology are not genes, organisms, and species, but replicators, interactors, and lineages.
* "Interactors" are those entities that interact as cohesive wholes with their environments in such a way as to make replication differential.
* Genes are both replicators and interactors; they are not riding around in helpless and hapless "vehicles".
* Organisms are not as discreet, unitary, and well organized as we assume; entities more inclusive than single organisms can act as interactors.
* Many features of science stem from the interaction between the reward system of citation and its social context (competition, cooperation, etc.).
* Scientists, like organisms and genes, act altruistically and cooperatively, because altruism at one level is inclusive self-interest at another.
