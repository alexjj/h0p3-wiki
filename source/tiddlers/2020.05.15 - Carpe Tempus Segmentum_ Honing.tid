title: 2020.05.15 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Honing

* Woke at 7
** So much fucking sleep. Head hurts. I needed sleep. Dreams all over the place. 
* Read+Write
* Honing my F5Bot. 
* My wife is grumpy. Hrm. 
** What the fuck is going on? The world. My wife is so sensitive to the world. She is a vibrating indicator. 
** She needs Saturday off, off. 
*** Perhaps [[Family Time]] should be compressed further. 
** We cannot fix everything, and she has a right to feel grumpy. 
*** Usual engineer's disease in me too. I don't know what to do either.
** My son kept her up late, but this isn't it. 
*** Her house has been discombobulated this week too. Our usual routines were thrown out the window. 
* Hugs
** It's been like a ghost_town with my offspring living in their rooms (except for gardening). Our interactions have been brought to a halt. Almost nil. 
*** When they are free, surely I will never see them again. =(
* Called [[Charlie]]
* Vidyachat with [[JRE]]
** He's looking good.
** I got to see Matthew do his thing. Cute AF. His eyebrows are mischievous looking. He's growing so goddamn fast. A year old here soon. 
** We shot the shit.
** My brother has to continue getting colonoscopies. No cancer though. This is good.
** My brother is a good dad.
** Also, court date for setting more court dates coming up here.
* [[AIR]] called me back.
** Chillaxing conversation, except we had about a dozen breaks in connection. =/.
*** All the tools were failing. I think there was something wrong with his internet connection.
** He's gardening some too, saving up for a car. 
* Read+Write
* [[JRE]] called me again. =)
** He was talking with some of the Tom Hanks CP conspiracy theorists, walking them through it.
** He had a question about morality and epistemology. 
* Walk with wife
** =). 
* Orange chicken, stir fry, eggrolls, vodka
* //The Great// binge
* Sleep by 3
