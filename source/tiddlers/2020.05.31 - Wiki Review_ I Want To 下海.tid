title: 2020.05.31 - Wiki Review: I Want To 下海

* [[2020.05.30 - Link Log: World of Maymays]]
** I'm glad everyone was psyched to see [[Link Log]]s during [[Family Time]]. So much braincandy.
* [[2020.05.28 - PAlec: I Couldn't Wait]]
** This guy has been a pleasant surprise. He's obviously a much better programmer than I am. I'm hoping he will go [[PSM]].
* [[2020.05.30 - Wiki Review: Spacesuits]]
** I am surprised by the reactions I've seen to [[MMacKay]]'s letter. He seems to get what I'm doing in here more clearly than most.
*** I hope he takes a long time to ponder and we get to talk. I read through his work. We may experience some difficulties in Daoism.
* [[2020.05.30 - TDL: Launder Your Reputation]]
** Perhaps I have convinced my daughter to profoundly organize her room for the sake of her wardrobe. I wish she would see the light. 
* [[2020.05.30 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: I Watch The World]]
** It was a good day. I was extremely pleased with [[Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση]] presentations. Everyone was pleased, I think. I think that has been one of the saving graces of the week. 
** Without a philosophical surge in the proletariat, they will not have the tools to direct their will toward fitting answers. I do my best. Most really DGAF tho.
* [[2020.05.30 - Prompted Introspection: AC]]
** Completed. I realize it is not cheap. We do better work though.
** My family is annoyed that I didn't turn up the heat though. It's not like I was super cold, but I don't think it's about a rational argument from them.
