!! Audit:

* Hrm, responses to the summaries was an interesting idea. My offspring do this often; sometimes they have this freewheeling creativity I admire so much. 
* My son's choice of [[Saint Hegel]] has sent us on a tailspin. We now have to cover the history of philosophy in a flash to get back to him. I'm glad he's so fearless.
* It's hard to describe [[audit]]ing with the new summaries.
** It's like a cherry-picked compression of our own [[CTS]]'s from 4 angles.
* My daughter's writing ability continues to improve. She's been feeling more motivated overall.
** It's been a good month.
* My wife has been more social! =)
* [[TTP]]s have been some seriously heavy lifting. I've been the straight villain against my everyone in this place. It's gotten easier though. I'm glad.
* Each passing year, we break more and more of my PII rules. It was inevitable. I am glad that we are able to relax more. 
* My offspring and I engaged in [[Kitty Kat Korner]] empathy-building, and that shows up even stronger here. God damn do they have an autistic dad.
