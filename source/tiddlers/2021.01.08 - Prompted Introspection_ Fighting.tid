title: 2021.01.08 - Prompted Introspection: Fighting

!! Are yelling fights in relationships more typical and inevitable, or terrible and avoidable?

As to the relationships you have in mind, I'm sure it's typical, inevitable is too strong a word, but likely seems fitting. Terrible, yes, in many respects, but also sometimes necessary too. The question is better generalized: [[W5H]] should you fight in life, and [[FTSO]] what? What even counts as fighting? It doesn't have to be loud, and any word can be a swearword. There are many ways to cause pain. [[Gradual]]ized [[T42T]] includes fighting. 

I'm oddly positioned to speak on this one from one extreme. Even though most of my fighting doesn't look like it, there are no people in my life I don't fight with to some [[dok]]. [[Wiki Litmus Test]] was true of me long before I started writing this pile. Some are going to stand in the pocket with me, and most don't care. I work hard to feel the pain I would inflict with my words, to know the weight and costs we're incurring. I find it best to argue early, often, and openly; it saves heartache down the road. Those who build relationships with me must draw their lines in the sand with me.<<ref "h">> Uncovering is expensive; material dialectics have a cost.<<ref "i">> Can I justifiably avoid fighting? Sometimes.

As a delusional cyborg, I'm generating at least two interpretations<<ref "p">> of anyone I'm spending more than 5 minutes with, [[ridtyawtr]], and I'm searching and filtering myself for the fitting middle. It can be on the street, thinking about your words on plebbit, a video, or whatever. Most of it isn't even conscious, though, like an autistic retard, I will burn all my cores and my ray often enough too. I am asking myself who I think you are, including who you could be. What [[good]] can I do here? What [[good]] can we be for everyone? Usually, nothing or not much, or better yet: I don't know. My understanding of the world and who we are is often too poor. Due to my own malicious incompetence, it is usually better that I say nothing.<<ref "c">> In some cases, my [[ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱]] affords me the chance to have said what needs to be said without confronting someone directly. I suppose I draw the lines in the sand for us too.

This is a sad [[prompt]] for me. I don't want to be anti-social. This is the [[game]]state before me. There is a world falling apart before me. Who and what am I going to fight for?
