>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Sleep well, TTYL, my friend! `/cheers`

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> I am off to bed

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>been nice chatting

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>cheers

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> I think it's gorgeous schizoposting. I think it wrestles with absurdity, the ineffable, identity and change, and, it is filled with eros (https://philosopher.life/#Antipleonasm%20Analysis). Poetry is exceptionally personal. I am reminded of the pipeline: Philosophy->Religion->Poetry->Silence.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> well if you have seen the poetry

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> what did you think of them

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Yes, I have seen this. This is not my first time encountering you. Thank you. What else do you like? What about music?

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>you ask about art

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>well I like the erotic poetry of Australia's leading erotic poet Magister colin leslie dean

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>free for download in pdf-let me know what you think

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/book-genre/poetry/

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>to the discerning reciter -they must be spoken aloud- there is alot of philosophy, spirituality, mysticism, psychology beneath the surface

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>What kinds of flowers do you like? I'm sure there's more to experience than talking about what is meaningless. Any particular pieces of art stand out to you?

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>thanks for the offer

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>but

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>I will just smell a flower

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>I don't know why we should agree that is all you can (in its various modalities) say.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>I've considered taking some more classes in philosophy. I live next to an okay school for it. I admit, it's been many years since I've enjoyed capitalism's finest offerings here. I'll agree there's something wrong with academic philosophy, if you'd like to consider that. I study philosophy on my own or with those I love, including strangers like you. It's my honor to meet you, btw.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Having taught plenty of introductory philosophy courses, I can assure you that meaninglessness is not the conclusion we're meant to draw (it's unwise), though some do. Many people experience the vertigo of your flower.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>If you'd like, I am happy to speak with you about these philosophers: https://philosopher.life/#Timelines%3A%20Philosophers

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>dude all I can say is

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>go enroll in philosophy

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>in phil 101 you will be shown what is wrong with philosophers argument

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>the next 3 + years you will be shown more flaws in philosophers

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>and by the time you do your Phd if you have not realized it is all meaningless diarrhea and you have wasted your life on nonsense

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Oh, qiling, you have no idea who I am or why I do what I do (though perhaps you will find out). I left behind many of those "intelligent people" too (and I can offer evidence if that's what you need). I'm not here to merely mentally arm wrestle (you can engage, but you choose not to), though if I were, could it not also be my smelling of flowers in this practice? Sometimes, those in great need must carry with them butterflies and flowers to war to remember what they are fighting for.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>I am someone who takes Rainbow Vomit quite seriously.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>I am doing my best to "get it," and, I [[hope]] you will enjoy your pointless (according to you) pointing.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>dude

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>obviously you think what you debate is meaningful thus not getting my point

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>if you want to debate go do philosophy and all you intelligent people can spend hours days being clever pointing out the flaws in each other argument-as they are there in all thoughts/philosophies

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>you want a mental arm wrestle

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>i cant engage for as i said

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>if I give you a thought it will end in meaninglessness

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>if you give me a thought it will end in meaninglessness

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>thesis antitheses they all end in meaninglessness

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>i prefer not to waste my time on verbal diarrhea but smell a flower

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>I posted this post to point something out

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>YOU ALL just dont get it

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Just because you told me X doesn't make X true. And, similarly, just because you think your argument is valid doesn't make it valid. If you think it's true, then what are you doing here? I take it, you are compelled to announce that your announcement is meaningless, and repeat that endlessly. Would you like to end the argument there? It's a meaningful ending, of course.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>you say

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>" to argue with others in charity?"

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>I have told you All thoughts thus arguments end in meaninglessness

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>you want me to engage in a debate -which you think is valid;but which I regard as just verbal diarrhea as it is all nonsense

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>you think what you argue is meaningful-thus you dont get my point

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>where as i said

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>All products of human thought end in meaninglessness

>>>>>>>>>>>>>XD. I love you, qiling. To be clear:

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>You said dude "you aren't responding to me in good faith"

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>wrong I responded but you dont get it

>>>>>>>>>>>>>This is //a// response, but that doesn't make it a good faith response. Do you know what it means to attempt to argue with others in charity? I know it's expensive to do well. Lawd, do I.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>I think we are both broken people, ostracized, struggling with how to deal with being lost in the desert, often alone. I hate that feeling of meaninglessness for myself and [[others]], more than I know how to put into words. I want you to know that you can reach me whenever you need, for whatever reason. Keep a copy of that ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 in your back pocket (https://philosopher.life/#Readme) just in case.

>>>>>>>>>>>>you said dude

>>>>>>>>>>>>"You aren't responding to me in good faith"

>>>>>>>>>>>>wrong I responded but you dont get it

>>>>>>>>>>>You aren't responding to me in good faith. Be honest with yourself (however "meaningless" you may think that is in the moment).

>>>>>>>>>>>You have not attempted to address the external world or meaning external to our minds. The semantics of the world are not products of our minds. We access representations of it. You aren't responding to my questions, qiling. I've been around the block, and I know what it looks like when my interlocutors are being honest.

>>>>>>>>>>>My claim is that part of what is meaningful rests upon meaninglessness, but that does not imply it is meaningless. You also aren't handing anyone some exceptional proof here, I'm having to bridge the gaps for you as charitably as I can.

>>>>>>>>>>>Why do you engage in this crusade? It's a curious thing to do if it doesn't mean anything anyways, right?

>>>>>>>>>>you said
>>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>>>"If you aren't going to actually respond to my questions, then it's basically like wagging your finger"
>>>>>>>>>>
>>>>>>>>>>I did respond but you dont get it

>>>>>>>>>>thesis antitheses they all end in meaninglessness

>>>>>>>>>You remind me of Sir Cratylus, though I think you are fighting against the absurd. I know the crisis. It's a metamodern fight to not commit philosophical suicide, to stare into the abyss well, to wrestle with the angels and examine the turtles all the way down.

>>>>>>>>>If you aren't going to actually respond to my questions, then it's basically like wagging your finger. A [[good]] [[faith]] argument is going to require you to unfold and uncover with me. It's possible you've made a mistake, and I think you leap at a conclusion without due diligence in this case.

>>>>>>>>>I think there is a manner in which all possible thought dialectically ends in a contradiction. I don't think you are insane (though I can see you are uncharitably abused by plebbitors).

>>>>>>>>as I said you keep coming up with "thoughts" "mind" "contradiction" "human" "sufficient reason"

>>>>>>>>and all I can say is

>>>>>>>>All products of human thought end in meaninglessness

>>>>>>>Why do you think I don't seem to get it?

>>>>>>>What is meaning?

>>>>>>>I'm not talking or thinking about that which is merely human thought here. I'm talking about a true contradiction external to all human minds.

>>>>>>you dont seem to get it

>>>>>>note the "ALL" in the statement

>>>>>>ALL products of human thought end in meaninglessness

>>>>>Hey. We're surfing together tonight. Note, I shreddit everything older than 72 hours. I suggest Tox or Session (https://philosopher.life/#Contact%20h0p3) with me for a variety of reasons.
>>>>>
>>>>>That's a great question, and I'm going to continue down that road: where does anything come from? Do you agree to the principle of sufficient reason? Are you an epistemic externalist?

>>>> so where did The Dialetheia come from?

>>> Why should I think The Dialetheia is merely a product of our minds?

>>being a product of human thought then Dialetheia will end in meaninglessness

>I am happy to speak with you, [nomad](https://philosopher.life/#Find%20The%20Others). We can talk about The Dialetheia. This is a painful place for many of us.

All products of human thought end in meaninglessness

0.999.. is an infinte decimal-the 9s dont stop-not a whole number

1 is an integer -whole number

when 1 a whole number-integer = 0.9999.. not a whole number-not an integer

then maths ends in contradiction

x = 0.999...

10x = 9.999...

10x-x = 9.999... - 0.999...

9x = 9

x = 1

Which is a "contradiction" because a "finite number" be equal to a "non-finite number"

Which is a "contradiction" because a integer be equal to a non-integer

All products of human thought end in meaninglessness
