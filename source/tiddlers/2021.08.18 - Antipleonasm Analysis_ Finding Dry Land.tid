If you cannot trust yourself, you cannot even trust your mistrust of yourself â€“ so that without this underlying trust in the whole system of nature you are simply paralyzed.

I appreciate how this claim ought to be interpreted as responding to the evils of egoism and nihilism. There's a realism to saying we do sufficiently behold some things-in-themselves for good reasons.

[[Trust]] ultimately reaches beyond computation with a leap of [[faith]]. This is yet another face of The Foundation problem. Insofar as what we believe about and experience of The World (and we are a part of it) is a construction of our mind, we are obligated to trust our inferences and [[phenomenology]] to some [[dok]] to justifiably believe anything. This is part of our plight. We still must [[Question Everything]] and secure our {[[Axioms]]} as best we can. I think of it a bit like growing a crystal suspended in fluid. 

I admire your claim and even what I take to be your motivation. Saint Wittgenstein thought the questions of philosophy weren't even false, but non-sensical, all the way down in the end. Why even try to symbolize the ineffable, eh? Even his own work contradicts itself, as he well knew. In his vicious pursuit of certainty, his hermeneutic spiral ladder destroyed itself like a tower of babel. He tried to have his skeptical cake and eat it too. He could not accept even minimalist, telic [[faith]] as justified [[fideism]]. Further, it is [[The Dialetheia]] that worms its way into all things, but trusting such a thing is so antithetical to most logicians (especially logical monists). Instead, they seem more likely to take up either mere subjectivity or the principle of explosion that reduces everything to absurdity, to flatness, where nothing [[salient]] can ever rise but for a temporary {[[dream]]} that dissolves itself back into the sea. This is the postmodern condition we've faced probably since before there was writing. One must have a Neurathian boat to float upon to survive, and prudential epistemic justification is not fundamentally wrong. It is here that the epistemologist who only takes alethic justification and somehow believes their work is not a fundamentally moral kind has already failed.

Unfortunately, "nature" is a weasel word. If you mean to say that we must trust that there is an external world of facts and objects (unlike our dear Saint Wittgenstein), that our senses and reason pick out something that is [[other]] to us and just as real as our own ability to attend to anything at all, then, yes, you are correct. I adore that you pick out how bracketing and methodical doubt taken to the N^^th^^ degree paralyzes us (I often say it "freezes us").

I simply don't know how to do this well enough, my friend. It may be equivalent to the fundamental problem of philosophy. Of course, I giggle like a retard when I think of how some wise ancient skeptics were so quick to say "yes" to the charge that "you don't know shit." XD. Yup, we are buffoons, `/nod`. Sometimes it do be like that. But, of course, we're already playing the game to say "yes (I know I don't know)." I am always justified in asking why one believes it is a mere game, never to be trusted as anything more than illusion. Epistemic humility is crucial, however, like a virtue with a golden mean, one can fail to accept our underlying purpose. Trust begins there. It is a [[hope]].
