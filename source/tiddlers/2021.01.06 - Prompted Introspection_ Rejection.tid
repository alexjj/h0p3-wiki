title: 2021.01.06 - Prompted Introspection: Rejection

!! Do you ever feel guilt or shame for romantically rejecting people who are interested in you?

It's quite rare that someone is interested in me, but it has happened before (freaks :P). You might say beggars can't be choosers. Not only am I generally invisible or fumbling (avoiding this problem altogether), I'm also neither attractive (by status, appearance, what have you) nor romantic (even when I try). Those who have directly asked me have received (though perhaps not as quickly or splendiferously as they'd have [[hope]]d), and eventually they almost always learn I am not their cup of tea (surely I'm an acquired taste to be served on rare occasions, at best). Well, hold on, I have not intentionally romantically (a word I can't define well enough) rejected someone except once (and it doesn't fit this question appropriately),<<ref "o">> but I have felt bad after recognizing that I was oblivious to someone's interest (I'm an idiot): this has similar effects to rejection, and perhaps it is an indirect rejection.<<ref "d">> I can't say it's always up to me, but my poor communication skills and inability to empathize effectively enough with [[others]] causes unpredicted and unintended pain too. To some radical extent, like everyone else (but moreso), I have a duty as an autist to learn how to detect and experience what other people are thinking and feeling as though these mental states were my own; I cannot say I've been effective enough given my resources. It is likely the case I have morally failed here, but I'm not sure how to pick it out (and that too is likely a moral failing). 

As a schizo, I've faced rejection in a lot of contexts (even and especially the subconscious variety). I've had to sort through what it means, including interpreting when it is due (or at least fair) and when it is not. That can make it easier to be charitable here in both directions, [[WINTCIS]]. I try to be hedged-conservative in how I address and impose my claim-rights.

I do have a moral problem with seeking anything, including persons, purely in virtue of [[beauty]] rather than righteousness.<<ref "a">> It's already wrong by definition (romantic decisions are no exception either), but even the consequences are obviously absurd.<<ref "c">> On average, [[good]] people are not rewarded or treated fairly in the marketplace. The idea that preference as a description ought to dictate prescription is one of the egoist's standard moves. It's easy to do the wrong thing because we aren't necessarily attracted to what we ought to be attracted to, [[WINTCIS]]. Hence my respect for reason!<<ref "x">>

Rejecting people (including parts of ourselves!) in any context requires justification and sometimes negotiation.<<ref "h">> We do have to weigh transactions and shop for relationships (and building them at any stage always has a price), but not all methods are morally permissible, and some approaches are more equitably eudaimonically optimal than others. Fairly binding ourselves together has far reaching implications and not all of them pleasant. [[FTO]]'s hospitality is meant to extend all the way down. I don't know where we are heading, nomad, but it's my honor to be here with you (even if I'm failing!). Unfortunately, I don't know what people want from me, nor do I know what they need well enough, nor do I know how I can be of most use to everyone well enough. I take my relationships extremely seriously though, even with [[Anonymous]] persons. I have a lot to learn and practice.

<<footnotes "o" "When I was on a mission trip to Denver as a teenager, we took a bunch of kids to see NFL players practice. One young child sitting next to me on the bus attempted to affectionately reach for what was not hers. She was obviously abused and did not understand. I did my best to find her help. While that is technically a type of romantic rejection, it's so wildly different than what is intended by this question that I'm setting it aside.">>

<<footnotes "d" "And, under doxastic voluntarism, I may still hold some measure of responsibility for my ignorance, and therefore I probably am guilty!">>

<<footnotes "a" "Obviously, I'm not speaking about merely the superficial.">>

<<footnotes "c" "I will continue to make the case for state-sponsored prostitution. Working to eliminate that market would change so many dynamics in the world for the better. It wouldn't solve all the problems that arise from this question, but it would mitigate some.">>

<<footnotes "x" "And exponentially so when we reach the problem of [[Justice]].">>

<<footnotes "h" "Developing the fitting preferences for justification can be so hedonically valuable! Not all morally virtuous agents are eudaimonically virtuous, sadly, but [[Positive Disintegration]] is one of the major existential hacks that can help sometimes. Also, this is one of the advantages I maintain in the reflective equilibrium of [[The Golden Rule]]: many of my preferred pursuits often have more weight to them than mere subjective preference ([[WINTCIS]]). It reminds me of [[Rust]]'s safety in a way; solving for the problem from the beginning maximizes justified autonomy and bypasses so many problems of treating others as mere means (which is always a type of rejection at some level). What ought we do with competing incommensurable desires, sensibilities, egos, and essences? What are the overriding reasons? Well, that's what I was trying to work out anyhow, [[WINTCIS]].">>
