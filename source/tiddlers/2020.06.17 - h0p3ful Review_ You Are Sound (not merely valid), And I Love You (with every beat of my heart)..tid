** srs.ly
** I'd like to see the script run in production tomorrow. You are both responsible, and you will both have the script and explanation in your wikis.

** You make an excellent point, and ol' Chuck would surely know what you meant (and agree). I would like to see you try to flesh out the other interpretations and deliver the final killing blow, please. You are in Disjunction Elimination territory here; time to give us a proof by cases with your dazzling rhetorical style and sage clarity.

** `/standing-ovation`. Bravo! You say what is kind so nicely too. It's amazing.

** I think you want to be able to come back and scrape again for updates. It depends on how much you aim to change, but at the very least, the new ones (or ones that you've not touched by hand yet) would probably be worth updating, on average.

*** Sounds like a famous problem in CS that we could build a tool to attempt to solve. =)

** Yeah, Mondays are rough. The weekend is so bitchin' by comparison. We will learn to manage it better and better.
*[[The Lightning Thief // Chapter Fifteen]]
** It's a good start. I like how you've combined the entire process into one tiddler. Migrating the material, percolating up.
** I don't think most people care about //Brave New World//, madame.
*** I agree: they should. It's expensive to think about some problems, and yet, they should. We have exceptionally high moral requirement prices on our heads: to whom much is given, much is required.
** Your [[review]]s, and your voice, continue to improve. 
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** [[three_sum]] has a provocative name. Make sure you throw the filetype on the title and tag it, please. 
*** Knowing that it is meant to be a `.py` file means something when we are only looking at titles (or a title with a window of context).
** Some of my favorite work to read from you boils down to your response, reconstruction, or answer to someone else's claims, prompts, or questions, including: [[2019/06/17 -- Writing Log]]. [[Saint Plato]] would be happy to see it too.
