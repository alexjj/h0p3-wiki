Stranger: hihihihhihhihihh
Stranger: 'hi
Stranger: hi
You: Hello there =)
Stranger: I'm racist and classist :)
You: Oh.
Stranger: =)
You: Why?
Stranger: I dislike the inferior types
You: I do believe some humans are inferior to others in some non-trivial moral respects.
You: The choices we make to shape who we are are part of that.
You: I might call myself classist in a sense.
Stranger: there is too much emphasis on "choice"
Stranger: humans are literally animals
You: Just machines, huh?
Stranger: not necessarily
You: Oh, what else could they be?
Stranger: I don't believe in any hocus pocus or free will
Stranger: but even with free will
Stranger: we are just mammals and have pretty obvious and trivial drives
You: I suppose your beliefs are thoroughly a result of whatever you are conditioned to have given your genetics and memetics.
Stranger: yes?
You: What is a non-trivial drive? Are there any things which are unconditionally good in this world?
Stranger: idk I suppose I can't define trivial, I just meant it in the spirit that our drives are mammalian and not divine
You: I think that is almost a fair description of a large percentage of people I've encountered.
You: So, what do you do with your racism and classism?
Stranger: it is by definition a description of 100% of people you have encountered since humans are mammals
Stranger: what do I do with my moral non realism and my belief in evolution? idk what you mean
You: How does it affect what you do in the world? How do you behave differently, if at all, with the other primates around you?
Stranger: pretty much not at all
Stranger: how does a Muslim salesman operate differently from a Christian salesman working at the same store? lol
You: It's impressive that your beliefs don't seem to have much impact on your behavior.
You: Unless, you mean to say that most people hold beliefs like yours.
Stranger: whose beliefs DO have impacts on their behaviours?
Stranger: about the heritability of intelligence for example
You: Seems obvious that beliefs have impact on what we do. Those aren't quite epiphenomenal.
Stranger: that's a moralism, the idea that people disagreeing/agreeing with your opinion/religion is IMPORTANT for their lives
Stranger: whether or not I believe abortion is wrong has basically 0 impact on my life
You: I'm open to the claim that beliefs may be fundamentally moral-seeking in some respect.
Stranger: ???
You: That must be a very curious experience.
Stranger: how does believing that the 9/11 attack was an inside job impact someone in life?
Stranger: almost not at all
Stranger: you're attributing too much importance to morality/ideology
You: One can have beliefs that aren't expressed, that aren't something we disagree and agree with others about. It doesn't have to be about ideology so directly.
Stranger: huh
Stranger: are you a brainlet
You: I wish I understood what you meant by importance.
You: Perhaps
Stranger: 99% of the lives of a devout muslim and a devout mormon are the exact same
You: Do you have any links you think I should take a look at?
You: Quite a generalization
Stranger: the idea that what you believe is important at all is a Christian/Muslim/generally religious lie
You: Oh, I think plenty of non-Abrahamic traditions take their beliefs to be important and about important things.
Stranger: ok
Stranger: it's fake news though
Stranger: you can have whatever head canon you want, it's mostly irrelevant to the real world
You: That is quite a story.
Stranger: how?
You: I don't think you have a justification for either of those claims.
Stranger: beliefs about basic and important things matter like object permanence and delayed gratification. Beliefs about monetary policy or the afterlife is completely irrelevant to how you fare in life
You: Oh. I'm glad to see you swing that direction some.
You: The latter is still non-obvious.
Stranger: how?
Stranger: give me a counter example
You: Why should I?
Stranger: Why should you?
You: Yeah, you don't seem to have a reason to engage in discourse here.
Stranger: lol
Stranger: you're right, I don't
You: For the lulz, maybe?
Stranger: I literally don't care what you believe, we are just playing a game
Stranger: and if you refuse to play, what can I do?
Stranger: what should I do?
You: Sounds like beliefs having some impact on your actions here.
Stranger: how>
Stranger: ?
Stranger: what import is this conversation to my life? almost 0
You: So, what do you take yourself to be doing here?
Stranger: what do you? are you on some mystical magical self-important quest for the truth? I'm just talking
You: Definitely on such a quest. We all are. Some are terrible at it.
Stranger: you obviously aren't since you refuse to answer my earlier question
Stranger: okay
Stranger: then you are terrible at it
Stranger: counter example to my claim?
You: Oof. You got me. I'm terrible at it.
Stranger: oh nigger

A sacrifice on the altar. I will show you what the essence of dignity means, nomad. You may kiss my feet after I wash yours (just in case I need to kiss yours back). I think it's time to recite a Psalm. This was a highly cooperative conversation in which we spiraled in defection. In good [[faith]] wrestling, we train to spit {{Text Art: ùï±ùï¥ùïΩùï∞üî•}} in [[love]], and it must be disdainful in empathy in this case. May hotcoals burn them out. The perils of nihilism and egoism stand before us, and Sir Nietzsche still merits our [[Straussian]] criticism (as maybe he gnostically knew, and even Saint Wittgenstein had to face the [[music the second time around|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9FImc2LOr8]]). This was a mere language game to my interlocutor who intended to treat others as mere means. I oddly admire their boldness and going down swingin'. [[WWDD]]? I come to answer their kind. There was a lot of lying for all the appearance of honesty in there. It's an opportunity to be a petty child, of course. I [[hope]] it was a troll who meant to help me out, who picked out a serious flaw for us in our species (and, if so, thank you). Classic Socrates: Play ~~Dead~~ Dumb (it's true at some point anyway). This is why our college experiences need to be fittingly transformative in a spiritual sense (though I know not how to describe such a thing well enough); it is why you may not exclusively pick out positivist accounts of discourse as a practice, but that also doesn't mean we have no need for being highly logical in our instrumental reasoning. There's a mix there. I agree.

Stranger: Why did um
Stranger: Charles manson refer to his mom as an icebox and a penetitary
You: I have no idea.
Stranger: why does he have a nazi symbol on his forehead
You: I know almost nothing about Charles Manson.
Stranger: You Japanese?
You: I am not.
You: That's an interesting question.
You: What brought it to your mind?
Stranger: What question
You: > Stranger: You Japanese?
Stranger: Ah
Stranger: Oh you waiting on me
You: Yeah, I don't mind waiting. I'm just chillin'.
Stranger: I asked bc most americans know of charles manson. Figured id ask if your Japanese
You: I do know of, but not much about.
Stranger: Cause im watching a 1986 interview of him
You: What you think of it?
Stranger: Confusing
Stranger: I can't keep up with his rapid topic changes and wwird terms
You: I know that feeling.
You: This it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Edw-ftS2Jo ?
Stranger: See now im relating to manson
Stranger: He speaking facts
You: Sometimes he does say true things.
Stranger: Idk I think the people lied about him
Stranger: He gets seriously pissed at the accusations that his followers said he told them to kill
Stranger: See now he's going off the rails again
You: I haven't seen that part yet.
Stranger: Wait how do we know we watching same one
You: I don't.
Stranger: Mine is 35min
You: Mine appears cut. Only 7 minutes.
Stranger: My video is him in red shirt
You: Not the one I'm checkin' out then.
Stranger: Nah I compared the two. Yours is a year after mine
You: True.
Stranger: ngl I think if he shaved off that beard he'd look fairly attractive
You: I'm jumping around now, checkin' out different interviews with him.
Stranger: Thats good
You: He knows how to deliver a story.
Stranger: That he does. Keeps me from not watching a gaming video
Stranger: For a mid 80s video, he makes it so interesting
You: I watch gaming videos, more lately, than usual. LoL pro play still keeps me coming back.
Stranger: Manson do got a point rn. He got jerked over in regards to him not getting to have a defense during trial
You: That may easily be the case. I don't think most people are treated fairly in court systems.
Stranger: Got em good
Stranger: He speaks like that of how a person would speak today.
You: In what respects?
Stranger: Hold up he jumped up and is now doing caveman circles
Stranger: Aw my video ended
You: Always more to see.
You: Might be interesting to see how they compare.
You: Is there a cogent perspective to synthesize from them?
Stranger: Not really
Stranger: Goodnight
Stranger has disconnected.

Indeed, I have found [[The Other]]. What a curious creature this one is. There's plenty to interpret in Manson's interactions (often as a caged animal, though it is not clear who is in a cage with whom). I have no idea what this person is searching for.

You: Hello! =)
Stranger: Hi
You: What brings you here today?
Stranger: Omegle is just something I do to relax
You: Wow. I wish it were relaxing for me. Lol.
You: I find it draining often enough. What parts relax you?
Stranger: I'm just used to the people here. I just get worn out from reading and writing. Helps me get to sleep.
You: Oh. I see.
You: What do you read and write about in particular, when it's not on omegle?
Stranger: I don't write much besides when I come here. Sometimes I read books or what other people have to say.
You: (sometimes I think conversations on this platform aid in making my dreams vivid, but I don't know)
Stranger: I take melotonin (more than suggested dosages) and that really creates some interesting dreams.
You: That reminds me of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle - taking in more information than we might send out into the world (or something like that).
You: I've yet to do that.
You: Hrm.
You: Melotonin makes me groggy and limp without making me sleepy.
You: But, I would be interested in psychedelic properties.
Stranger: You have to actually try to sleep for it to work. If you just take a bunch and stay up you'll just feel sick for a while.
You: Oh, I do try to sleep with it. Go through the standard advice, and it doesn't seem to assist me.
Stranger: It's not really psychedelic. It just causes vivid dreams
Stranger: Unless you normally have psychedelic dreams I guess
You: Sometimes I do, particularly at the moment where I'm right on the edge of drifting off.
You: I'm prone to close-eyed hallucinations there, usually highly geometric.
You: So what book do you think are worth reading, and whose words should I take a look at? I'm the sort who likes to dig around and try to understand.
Stranger: I don't think I'm the right person to ask. I just read whatever is in front of me. It's not profound.
You: Oh. I see. That's interesting.
You: I'm surprised you don't curate more.
You: This place is dope, btw: libgen.rs/
You: Lots of books. It's a Library of Alexandria.
Stranger: Hopefully it's cooler
You: Ha
You: I'm glad that they've been so resilient over the years. They've faced non-trivial pressures over the years.
You: Book publishers are some of the more vicious abuses of the legal system I've encountered.
You: abusers* - I can't even English tonight
Stranger: They'll go after anyone these days.
You: Yeah. It's true.
You: Capitalism, of course, breeds innovation.
You: :P
Stranger: I've heard that too
You: Yeah. It's a pretty common meme, an old one, it checks out.
Stranger: Could be older
You: It may be, though not in those precise words.
You: I'm pretty convinced that capitalism exists long before the enlightenment era, way back when we were just primitive humans.
You: So, you spend a lot of time on your [[computer]]?
Stranger: That's what people tell me
You: Oh. How many hours a day you think you clock on such devices?
Stranger: Maybe 8 to 12
You: `/nod`
Stranger: Depends on the day and what else I have going on
You: I [[share]] that practice with you.
You: Is it primarily for work necessary to survive, or something else?
You: (inserting message here to make sure Omegle doesn't close the connection)
Stranger: I don't think Omegle does that on its own
You: Do you know how the platform works? I'm baffled by the technical bugs I've encountered.
Stranger: I have some understanding of it.
You: What do you think is occurring?
Stranger: Sometimes people disconnect on there own sometimes their network connection is interrupted.
Stranger: Not everyone has as stable a connection as they might like.
You: True. =/.
You: So, do you use your computer from 8-12 hours a day primarily for work necessary to survive, or something else?
Stranger: Work or entertainment
You: Is it your preference to be on your box that much? Do you agree with what other people tell you about the amounts you use it?
You: (I couldn't imagine not having my machine. I'd rather be dead.)

Stranger: can't be too picky on here
You: Like, learning arbitrary multiplication tables, I assume would eventually not be enjoyable.

You: Talking with lots of people totally different from me.
Stranger: i dont think its considered as chatroom
You: Oh, well, it is a narrow one at best. Maybe that isn't the right word.
You: What's a better term, you think?
Stranger: tbh no idea
Stranger: chat? xD
You: Ha. Cool. That works.
Stranger: chatting platform
Stranger: idk
You: This one is pretty special.
Stranger: as far as i know chatrooms are like public
Stranger: where are multiple people
Stranger: as in 2+
You: I think that's a standard way of talking about them. I can see that.
You: So, what do you enjoy doing when you aren't bored?
You: (or, what do you think is worth doing*, even if it isn't about enjoyment)
Stranger: you implying when im not here? xD
You: Not necessarily. You are here now because you are bored, but I could imagine coming here without being bored.
You: But, sure, what do you do when you aren't here?
Stranger: well id be bored either way
Stranger: whether im here
Stranger: or anywhere else
You: It can be difficult to find things that are worth our attention and energy.
Stranger: people are like only source that can kinda solve that problem
You: I think that is a fair claim! What would we do without others? I couldn't imagine that existence.
You: Do you have any people important to you in your life?
Stranger: sometimes i find a movie or some other activity that can help with boredom but yeah
Stranger: not really
You: What movies seem to hit the spot?
Stranger: i mean i wouldnt probably be here if i had important people in my life
Stranger: i guess
You: Sometimes there's something parasocial about them to me. I feel alive and even understood by empathizing with the characters.
You: That might be the case. I know this is often a bleak place, lol.
You: Loneliness, not just boredom, then?

Stranger: dude i feel like im being datamined
Stranger: xD
You: Oh, let's change topics.
You: I told you I'm here to [[Find The Other]], so I ask many questions to try to understand who you are.
Stranger: what does that mean
You: Would you like me to talk about myself, or should we talk about some other topic?
Stranger: "find the other"
You: Ah, well, I mean this: https://philosopher.life/#Find%20The%20Others
Stranger: hmm
You: "The Other" is some important concept or object that I don't know how to define or I don't understand well enough.
Stranger: i see
You: I think we can only understand ourselves and The World with the help of others.
Stranger: supposedly meditation is meant to help you understand yourself better
Stranger: spiritually
You: Perhaps. I'm interested in [[Theories of Meditation]] (https://philosopher.life/#Theories%20of%20Meditation).
You: I think the practice can give us insight into who we are to some extent, especially when we observe ourselves as some kind of other, perhaps.
Stranger: but not actually in meditation? xD
You: I meditate. There's over 500 uses of the word in my ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±. You can check my [[Carpe Tempus Segmentum]] logs (like a diary of my day). It's an important practice to me.
You: I can't say I'm skilled at it.
You: Do you enjoy meditation?
Stranger: i mean i barely do it
Stranger: but sure does sound like interesting thing
Stranger: i dont think i know myself that much
You: It can be an expensive task. I think [[Know Thyself]] is a calling.
Stranger: you religious?
You: Yes. I am a religious person of some kind.
Stranger: i see
You: And you?
Stranger: no
Stranger: atleast i dont think so
You: It's not so easy to define what consists in religion, to my blind eyes.
Stranger: hmm
Stranger: you consider yourself more logical person than emotional?
You: That is an interesting question. I just recently answered something that might be akin to it.
Stranger: like what is your first decision making method
You: https://philosopher.life/#2021.08.06%20-%20Prompted%20Introspection%3A%20Not%20Feeling%20It
You: I probably lean toward cognition more than is neurotypical, but I don't think that my use of logic escapes being emotional.
You: Our limbic systems are critical to having functioning frontal lobes that can engage in that slow, logical reasoning.
Technical error: Server was unreachable for too long and your connection was lost. Sorry. :( Omegle understands if you hate it now, but Omegle still loves you.

I wonder if the platform encourages users to answer quickly. Most of the connection problems I've found stem from waiting for my interlocutor to type out a response (though, perhaps there's no good way to distinguish between the closing messages in the end; maybe I've attached too much weight to them).
