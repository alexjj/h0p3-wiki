title: 2021.04.29 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Grind

Woke at 5. Chat with [[Variety Creepy]].<<ref "i">> [[TTTOTW]]. Thinkin' about [[kicks]] again. I've been quietly lurking, as one does, mirin' that dicksword.

Laundry and cleaning. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! Attempted VC in two places. Nope. 

Saw my wife off in the morning. Woke the offspring. Watched them finish their match. She didn't press her LoA advantage well enough, and his double capsize + elixir inevitability sealed the deal eventually (having to coax him to take every wincon available seriously; just because you probably can win however you want doesn't mean you don't slit the throat immediately when it is presented [we can be wrong]). I ate a lot.

Played a match with my daughter. Dialecture, and I don't think it's gonna happen.

[[TTTOTW]].

Played a match with my son. 

She came home, and I drummed on the bathroom door until she agreed that it would be better that I were inside the room with her. =).

Called [[JRE]]. Talkin' about curly hair and big noses, his deck not being built to his standards, raising another's genetic offspring (he's convinced that conditioning plays a lesser role in some respects, or at least less than he'd like), and he got his second shot too.

//The Walk//

[[Family Gathering]], sketti, we watched a show in my room instead of being at the table.

Both of my brothers have checked/asked to see if the insulation in the basement is wet. It is not. I am grateful for their help.

Bed is set as a couch now. It's even better. That is what I was going to do in our previous residence. It might look odd, but it's quite comfortable. Back support and the edge. Chilled with bro.

<<footnotes "i" "I am [[grateful]] that someone opens up with me. I do not know what to do when I am told some kinds of things. I need to be able to hold people sometimes, and my text will never be enough. I know what it's like to need family. Fuck, dude. =/.">>
