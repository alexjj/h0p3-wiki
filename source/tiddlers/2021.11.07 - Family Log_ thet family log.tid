!! How has your health been this week?

* 1uxb0x
** It's been fine.
*** Dude, you have had more headaches than usual. Need to get your eyes checked too, I think: you spend huge amounts of time in front of the screen.
* j3d1h
** Leg cramps, low energy. >:(
* k0sh3k
** Headachy - but hopeful that the new treatment will help. 
* h0p3
** Deep sleep. Still healing up impatiently. I think I am growing colder at higher temperatures than usual. I have felt good!
* ASK
** I'm sleeping a lot. I'm tired a lot. Overall, I'm improving, though I need to get a lot more exercise.

* Date was dope.
** Date WAS dope. 
* [[ASK]] has been fantastic to have in our lives everyday.

!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family (including ourselves)?

* 1uxb0x
** I'm happy that I've decided to make a server.
** You are a very kind and selfless person, often. For instance, you were willing to go without a kneeler today when there were only two, so that Swick and I could have them. You're a sweetheart! 
** I am glad to see you playing games with [[ASK]]. I hope your new server will be useful in that respect too.
** Your game ideas are fascinating. I'd love to see you program a full game sometime. :]
** You have a talent for patience that is uncommon and probably much more valuable than you realize. Thank you for being so patient with me.
* j3d1h
** I'm proud of how fast my characters evolve out of a single idea.
** Thanks for sharing stories and memes with me. :) 
** You have the gift of ignoring offensive and immoral people at key moments. It can be quite useful to have it roll off you.
** Thank you `\n` helping me learn git commands.
** Your characters are well thought out and very interesting. I very interested in seeing what you come up with!
* k0sh3k
** I fixed the broken string on my psaltery! 
** I have enjoyed listening to your hymns downstairs. I hope you will continue to practice with me in the room.
***Oh, I will. //I will.//
** Thank you for helping me consider sunday school.
** Thanks for chatting with my doctor (even though we didn't get anywhere new, lol).
** We haven't had a chance to get to know each other yet, but your presence fills the house with a sense of (Excited Peace?) That I find amazing. Thank you for existing.
* h0p3
** I invite even vile creatures to eat with us. I think that is a good thing.
** I'm happy I can talk about ideas with you-such as te SS13 server.
** I loved our date! Thank you for going to the bookstore with me, and thinking about wise purchases. 
** I love the way we effortlessly vibe with each other. It is only possible because of your high empathy and intelligence. Your totality is beautiful.
** I like your scrolling document title prototype. Might just steal it, actually.
* ASK 
** Your descriptions are very creative, and still intuitive to understand (perfect for a narrator's voice, imo).
** I adore your bells. The opposite of Jaws in some sense.
** I enjoyed hanging out and playing L4D1 with you.
**Thank you for making dinner for the kiddos last night.
** Thank you, too, for trusting us with your stories; we're glad to have you here and to have your trust. 
**You've done well forcing yourself to believe in a possible future. Keep working on that. Tomorrow is going to happen either way. You got this.
