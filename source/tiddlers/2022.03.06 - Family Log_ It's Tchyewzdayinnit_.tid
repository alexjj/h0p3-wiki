** I talked with smokey this week!
** You've done such a good job handling your mental breakdowns (extremely thoughtful on the edges). That is a crazy expensive place to be, and that self-control is something I hold in high regard. 
*** Pouring your anger into words and redirecting that lightning away from yourself (and not at those who don't deserve it) is quite a task. 
**** I'd like to add that you make it humorous. <3
** Your paperwork and coding have been coming along. I appreciate you taking up work that is difficult, where you feel lost, and you don't give up.
** Yet again, you handled advocating for your own health with your physicians well. 
** I really enjoyed discussing the church service with you today - and you've been talking more during devotions, too. I'm happy to hear your thoughts!
** I think it's cool that you're helping your sister with world-building!
** i liked talking some history with you this week.
** Your wiki is a delight to read. Your personality and good humor really shine through. Thank you!
* j3d1h
** i'm glad i decided to help smokey with some deckbuilding.
** Your Affinity Outfit was well-conceived and executed.
** I'm glad to hear you and your brother talking in your room so much. It's [[friendship]]. =).
** I'm happy that we got to talk to one another a lot this week!
** Thank you for helping me with my sync problems! :)
** I think it's cool that you include other people in your world-building!
** That outfit was really on point! 
* k0sh3k
** Although I had to learn what a linear foot was, I was glad to find out I'm on the ball with the MRC stuff and everything is on schedule!
** You are generous and kind. You open your home and heart to others. You work your ass off, and you are the central pillar of our home. Thank you.
** Pancake dinner was dope. Thank you. You have precious few hours left at the end of the day, and you spend it on others. You build family.
** I respect how you cultivate religious literacy in your offspring without forcing them to be Christians. It's up to them if they attend, self-identify, participate, and so forth. You respect their personhood. You are an excellent mother.
** Thank you for thinking about the church service with us every Sunday.
** thanks for the pancakes, they were wonderful. :)
** I had fun doing the shopping with you this week! Thank you for your company!
*** :)
* h0p3
** I am a fierce wrestler who works to be gentle.
***  It shows, and I believe your efforts bear fruit. I feel as safe as a baby bird in your hands.
** You've had a huge influence on how I create things with others-why I'm mainly a critic in storytelling.
*** May it serve you long after I am no longer fit to serve you.
** Thank you for emergency running out to the W-Entity for Mardi Gras supplies! I know it's not your favorite thing to do, and I appreciate it.
** Thank you for our American Pie date, too - it was nice, even if you //had// to wear your Rigby suit.
** thanks for picking up the baklava.
** I love watching you think! It is electric. I love that I get to watch whole worlds be born, live out their lives, and then see their salient viscera spread upon your /b/
* ASK
** You're [[wrestling]] in a very expensive place, and I respect your self-control, discipline, constructiveness, and thoughtful inspection. Heavy lifting!
** I've enjoyed gardening (including just thinking about it) with you. 
** //Raised by Wolves// is a dope show. Thank you for the recommendation. It's made Saturdays excellent.
*** It really is a cool show! I have no idea where it's going, and that's rare for me.
** Thank you for taking your health seriously. I know it's especially difficult for those as neurodiverse as ourselves.
** From one elitist to another, your [[music]] collection is absurdly [[beautiful]]. I need to sit down and import what I'm missing from yours into mine (no small task*).
** Thank you for walking with me despite how cold it is. I needed it.
** Thank you for offering to explain your first-aid kit to me, it's a rather important thing, innit?
** Thank you for the chicory! It's been a delightful addition to my coffee - and Kokonut agrees. :)
** you've been cooking a lot lately, and it's awesome every time. :]
** You are really good at writing nice things about people.
