//I'mma try to have fun while I learn me something, aight? Joe Brogan and Bruce Lee taught me all they know. I shall be [[just|Justice]] as merciless in our [[wrestling]], my ninja. Dedicated to [[anon]]s, catholics, and weebs of [[2021.05.10 - Anonymous: PKM General]]. I [[love]] you all.//

<br>

!! Summary-ish:

* a.k.a. Shinmen Takez≈ç, Shinmen Musashi-no-Kami Fujiwara no Harunobu, Miyamoto Bennosuke, Niten D≈çraku
** 1584.03.12-1645.06.13
** Raised by his monkcle ~~Iroh~~? 
*** Broski was his closest disciple who was given the ~~golden tablets~~ famous manuscript. 
** Suffered from eczema, neuralgia, and from what I gather: an [[empathy|Empathy]] disorder or difference.

* A legendary mythical zenflo Badass Buddhist, traveler, ronin, mindfucking duelist, two-sword and thrown-weapon expert, [[cave-hermit|Saint Plato]] author, and [[art]]ist.<<ref "m">>
** A merciless fighter from a young age, ~13. Mofo went hard, do or die, there is no try, OG [[Edgelord|The Neckbeard]] who thought he paid no mind to le sheeple.
** Authored: The Book of Five Rings and Dokk≈çd≈ç (The Path of Aloneness)
*** [[Purposely ambiguous|Realpolitik Speculation]], just like a real‚Ñ¢ strategist in writing. [[Straussian]] interpretations or bust, right?
** It remains unclear if he would defeat The Great One, Lord Steven Seagal, The Master of Aikido.
** ~~Dishonorable~~ Ruthless, purposely disrespectful, wildchild fighter. 
*** Fabled [[psychological warfare|Memetic Warfare]] tactician, abusing conventions and apparent pride against his opponents.
*** The best way to win is to win, okay? Forget technique when you can just get the job done with whatever just werx.
** [[Studied the blade|Poem: Recycling "The Blockchain Blade"]] rather than his [[penis]].
** Promoted the mastery of many artforms and practices as the warrior's true strategy in life.
*** Difficult to know if he thought he could decouple his religion and warriorhood. Do not anticipate a coherent perspective from this feller.
** Stoic, ascetic, pragmatist, [[Diogenes]] would have liked his awful smell
** Overreliance upon ambiguous metaphors, absolutist language, and oversimplifying generalizations
** [[Very pretty|Aesthetics]] art.

* The Book of Five Rings
** Earth
*** It is difficult to realise the true Way just through sword-fencing. Know the smallest things and the biggest things, the shallowest things and the deepest things. As if it were a straight road mapped out on the ground.
*** Resolute acceptance of death in both pen and sword.
** Wataaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
*** Water adopts the shape of its receptacle, it is sometimes a trickle and sometimes a wild sea. The principle of strategy is having one thing to know ten thousand things.
*** The purpose of self-possession is not to preserve one‚Äôs equanimity, but to be able to fight to the utmost.
*** Two Heavens, One Style; sounds dialectical.
*** Attitudes of Swordsmanship; sounds virtue theoretic.
***  A person should master many aspects of life allowing them to possess both balance and flexibility.
** Fire
*** The spirit of [[fire]] is fierce, whether the fire be small or big; and so it is with battles of any scope.
*** Strats: To hold down a pillow (their heads) & Crossing at a ford (know the critical moment and preempt, [[irwartfrr]])
** Wind
*** It is difficult to know yourself if you do not know others. To all Ways there are side-tracks. If you study a Way daily, and your spirit diverges, you may think you are obeying a good way, but objectively it is not the true Way. If you are following the true Way and diverge a little, this will later become a large divergence.
*** Muh nitenichi-ryu is the tits, unlike your shitstyle.
** Void
*** The Esoteric Way and the goal of the truest ~~Scotsman~~ ascetic Buddhist warrior practice: develop your "inner self" and you will be able to defeat an entire army, tenfold, become a god!! `/rawr`

!! Quote & Response:

<<<
; From one thing, know ten thousand things. 
: That sounds essentialist. Generalize from particulars. But, can you pick out which things matters most?

; Do not think dishonestly.
: [[Text Art: Preach, yo!]]

; The Way is in training.
: When are we not in training? 

; Become acquainted with every art.
: There's not enough time. This is a postmodern problematic. I agree that we must strive to be generalists so that we may pick out what is [[salient]].

; Know the Ways of all professions
: An admirable desire. I suggest diversifying and understanding one's purpose in order to pick out the fitting means. I [[like]] broad definitions of philosophy. 

; Distinguish between gain and loss in worldly matters.
: no u. Sounds consequentialist, but I don't see his teleology (nor how he can defend one).

; Develop an intuitive judgement and understanding for everything.
: System 1. Fitting [[bias]] is virtue-theoretic. [[Virtue is Knowledge]]. 

; Perceive those things which cannot be seen.
: If do right, no can defend. Strategy eventually relies upon metaphysics (though I don't think that was the intention).

; Pay attention even to trifles.
: A very tricky problem, no doubt. I admire this, as it is, yet again, virtue-theoretic.

; Do nothing which is of no use.
: toward what [[end]]? Efficiency for efficiency's sake is irrelevant.

;  In the void is virtue, and no evil. Wisdom has existence, principle has existence, the Way has existence, spirit is nothingness.
: My ninja. I agree with all but the last, most likely. Do you believe in [[Abstract Objects]]? Perhaps you are after method and process theology.

; 1. Accept everything just the way it is.
: [[Stoicism-fu]] and all its failures.

; 2. Do not seek pleasure for its own sake.
: I suggest [[The Good]]. Hao bout u, foo?

; 3. Do not, under any circumstances, depend on a partial feeling.
: No probabilistic inferences? The pursuit of [[certainty]] can be [[flawed|fff]].

; 4. Think lightly of yourself and deeply of the world.
: "lightly" might be partial. Does this mean we ought not depend on ourselves? We're part of The World too, right? A duelist's dualism.

; 5. Be detached from desire your whole life long.
: Is that your desire, sensei? There is no [[phenomenology]] without belief and desire. 

; 6. Do not regret what you have done.
: Yeah, why would want to learn from our mistakes?

; 7. Never be jealous.
: Don't know if "jealous" is the correct translation. Sounds like something the bourgeoisie want us to believe. Also, this is a desire, right? I admire asceticism, of course.

; 8. Never let yourself be saddened by a separation.
: That isn't up to us always, right? What we do with our sadness, sure, often. 

; 9. Resentment and complaint are appropriate neither for oneself or others.
: Are you complaining about complaining? `/wink`

; 10. Do not let yourself be guided by the feeling of lust or love.
: We get it: you are gay. Nothing wrong with that, homie. Or, you're being redundant. I'm complaining about that. 

; 11. In all things have no preferences.
: Except everything else you prefer here, right?

; 12. Be indifferent to where you live.
: That's not how you lived. You can't achieve complete feelings of indifference.

; 13. Do not pursue the taste of good food.
: Define [[good]] here, please. I agree there's a vice of excess to avoid. 

; 14. Do not hold on to possessions you no longer need.
: You have no account of need; it's unclear why you should possess anything on your grounds.

; 15. Do not act following customary [[belief]]s.
: `/yawn`. Except these, right? Whose customs? Even your own words follows some set of external conventions.

; 16. Do not collect weapons or practice with weapons beyond what is useful.
: [[gfwiwcgws]]. Useful [[FTSO]] [[W5H]]? 

; 17. Do not fear death.
: It's difficult to extricate the other fears and desires from our being toward death (maybe not even possible). You'll agree we should fear not living the right sort of life before we die, right? No. 

; 18. Do not seek to possess either goods or fiefs for your old age.
: To some [[dok]], sure. Prima facie, we ought to seek at least some goods though for our old age.

; 19. Respect Buddha and the gods without counting on their help.
: Gotchu fam. That customary shit. Solo √úbermensch, right? 

; 20. You may abandon your own body but you must preserve your honour.
: That doesn't sound like detachment, a lack of preference, or not following customary beliefs.

; 21. Never stray from the way. 
: [[Tao Te Ching]]? We all agree to this one. Fleshing out the semantics of The Way is another problem entirely, and I have my doubts about the five books handling it.
