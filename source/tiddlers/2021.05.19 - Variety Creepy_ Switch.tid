3:30 AM

Hi! I'm u/Variety-Creepy. The Indian 18 year old guy with whom you were chatting. I deleted my reddit account and created a new one.

I hope you remember me

Today
[[h0p3]]
2:15 AM

I am sad to see that account has been deleted.

You must forgive me, but I require evidence that you are that person. It is part of my line of work that I try to verify. Posting on your blog would be a clean way to prove it. However, I also feel like I've enough time spent with my friend that I could verify just through conversation.

How are you doing, friend?

[[Variety Creepy]]
2:19 AM

Okay, the last thing we talked about was a book called Panchatantra. You used to teach at Tulane University. Your kids are homeschooled. You have 2 brothers. You were expelled from high school. What more should I say?

I'm doing great! How are you?

[[h0p3]]
2:21 AM

(anyone who follows me can know that information, but I appreciate that you remember me)

I'm doing well enough. I enjoyed my walk with my offspring today. It was a special time.

What's making life great for ya?

Also, why did you delete your account? That's a rare thing to do.

[[Variety Creepy]]
2:27 AM

Okay, I can tell you some more information. We had an amazing conversation about something that will happen soon like the French Revolution. We were talking about taxes and who will stay in power after the Revolution. I hope this makes you confirm that it's me. We also talked briefly about the COVID-19 situation going on in India.

That's amazing!!!

Well, life is great for me when I'm happy. I'm happy when I spending time with my loved ones and a few really close friends.

[[h0p3]]
2:29 AM

I am glad to hear it, my friend.

[[Variety Creepy]]
2:29 AM

I deleted my account because I got fed up with Reddit. This app is amazing but I do not like the vast majority of the people who use this application/website. I do not like the mentality of most people and the hive mind and the reposts and many more reasons culminated into me deleting my account.

[[h0p3]]
2:30 AM

I know that feel.

[[Variety Creepy]]
2:30 AM

I then realised that I had lost the only way to contact you. But thankfully, I remembered your username.

Yeah, this is not the first time I've done this. I've been on Reddit for about 2.5 years and this is like my 6th time lol.

[[h0p3]]
2:31 AM

I hear that. I didn't even have an account for the looonngest time. Just pure lurking.

The chat function is something I'm glad they've added.

[[Variety Creepy]]
2:32 AM

Staying that way is bliss! Having an account tempts you to post and then argue and then you know, the list goes on

[[h0p3]]
2:33 AM

I tend to say very little on Reddit. Most aren't interested in careful discourse.

[[Variety Creepy]]
2:33 AM

I didn't use reddit when it did not have the chat function, so I really don't know about that, but yeah, having the chat function is really good. I cannot imagine Reddit without it.

I agree with that statement. I think I should learn to control myself. I type out whatever that comes to my mind sometimes.

[[h0p3]]
2:33 AM

Hackernews might be a place you'd enjoy, if you don't already.

[[Variety Creepy]]
2:34 AM

What is that?

[[h0p3]]
2:34 AM
[[Variety Creepy]]
2:35 AM

Hmm, it looks a lot similar to Reddit. It looks interesting

[[h0p3]]
2:35 AM

It is.

I'm very lucky to read what I find there.

Though, they will only discuss some kinds of things, imho.

It tends to be more mature, and you might like that.

[[Variety Creepy]]
2:37 AM

Oh okay. I will check it out completely in some time

Can we please switch from chatting on Reddit to a different website or something? I would not like to use Reddit because it's too tempting.

[[h0p3]]
2:38 AM

Indeed. I would strongly prefer another tool.

[[Variety Creepy]]
2:38 AM

Do you have any other tool in mind?

[[h0p3]]
2:39 AM

https://getsession.org/ and https://qtox.github.io/

They aren't everyone's cup of tea, from what I understand.

But, these are the tools I use. They are P2P. They don't require a centralized server (excepting a DHT entrance).

https://philosopher.life/#Contact%20h0p3 contains my public keys for these tools (tox and session). Also, there many tox clients available for different platforms.*

[[Variety Creepy]]
2:44 AM

Getsession.org looks good. I'll download it on my iPhone later.

[[h0p3]]
2:45 AM

That tool is making good progress. Lots of work being done on it. Hopefully, they'll have multi-device working soon enough.

[[Variety Creepy]]
2:46 AM

That's good to hear.

I'll get that. I need to shower now and then I'll download that platform on my phone.

[[h0p3]]
2:47 AM

`/salute`, TTYL.

[[Variety Creepy]]
2:47 AM

Bye, TTYL.

[[Variety Creepy]]
3:28 AM

Hi! I cannot access that website link. Hence I cannot add you on Session.

055101825be39dce2d25eca49b8b88c6cbc2b13a72db8ada1e924b9884598fa86a

This is my session ID. I hope you can add me on it.

[[h0p3]]
3:21 PM

Most of my discussion happens from that site.

Let's troubleshoot your computer.

What errors are you receiving?

(note that I also offer P2P sync options, so you don't need to access the site from the web)

[[Variety Creepy]]
11:13 PM

The website does not load at all

[[h0p3]]
11:28 PM

Okay, what error in particular?

It's a very large file, but you should see at least the background load pretty early on in the file download.

It's 16MB compressed.

[[Variety Creepy]]
11:41 PM

I really don't get any error. I just open the link and wait and wait and wait

My internet speed is pretty good. So, I really don't know what the problem is

[[h0p3]]
11:43 PM

Is it this way on all your devices?

[[Variety Creepy]]
11:44 PM

Not all. I use Reddit on my Android phone. It shows this problem in here. It works in my laptop. I've not tried it in my iPhone, so I really don't know what happens in iOS.

[[h0p3]]
11:46 PM

Try another browser. Let me know if your network throughput is registering a download.

[[Variety Creepy]]
11:46 PM

I tried it Brave and Chrome.

[[h0p3]]
11:49 PM

Are you getting a background to load?

[[Variety Creepy]]
11:49 PM

What's that?

[[h0p3]]
11:49 PM

the rainbow image on the left, with black background, that is the site's background image: it loads early in the process.

[[Variety Creepy]]
11:50 PM

No, I'm not getting that.

[[h0p3]]
11:51 PM

Alright, on Android you can use Termux (every Android user should install that piece of software anyways).

You can download the file straight from the terminal.

wget 'https://philosopher.life'

[[Variety Creepy]]
11:53 PM

Downloading it.

[[h0p3]]
11:55 PM

may have to pkg install wget, btw

[[Variety Creepy]]
11:55 PM

I cannot reach your website.

philosopher.life isn't working for me

[[h0p3]]
11:57 PM

what error did you receive on the wget?

Can you resolve the domain name to the IP?

Today
[[Variety Creepy]]
12:21 AM

I really don't understand all of this technical terms.

It doesn't load. The Load bar gets stuck at 70%

[[h0p3]]
12:22 AM

I appreciate that. I'll keep walking you through it. It's worth troubleshooting the connection on your phone.

Did you install Termux?

Here's another route, P2P, you can install Resilio Sync and use this read-only key: BKPIF6Z4EZIC3WJURWNTQ6SJ5M5AMYVW5

That doesn't even touch the domain https://philosopher.life/. It's separate and it predates it.

[[Variety Creepy]]
12:25 AM

Oh okay. Downloading it

Yes, I have installed Termux

[[h0p3]]
12:26 AM

What error message did wget give you?

[[Variety Creepy]]
12:33 AM

I cannot open the wget at all

[[h0p3]]
12:34 AM

wget is a command you'll run inside Termux

[[Variety Creepy]]
12:34 AM

How do I run it?

[[h0p3]]
12:34 AM

wget 'https://philosopher.life'

That should either tell you to install wget or actually run the command

[[Variety Creepy]]
12:35 AM

That website is not working.

[[h0p3]]
12:36 AM

Oh, well, this bypasses the browser. I'm first checking your connection, to see if you can even get the file downloaded.

[[Variety Creepy]]
12:37 AM

Are you sure that there are no restrictions on the viewers from a different country? I have a feeling it is related to that.

[[h0p3]]
12:37 AM

The website works around the world, on Android too. It loads through my Bangalore proxies on my devices too.

[[Variety Creepy]]
12:38 AM

That's good.

Do you think there's a problem with my Android then?

[[h0p3]]
12:38 AM

We're checking that now. I would be quite surprised.

[[Variety Creepy]]
12:40 AM

I have a feeling that my phone is the problem. My Android is a bit crappy and I don't take care of it that much like I do with my iPhone and laptop.

[[h0p3]]
12:41 AM

I can appreciate that.

What message does the wget command give you?

And, have you tried the Resilio Sync connection?

[[Variety Creepy]]
12:42 AM

I don't get any command.

I'm trying

[[h0p3]]
12:42 AM

type in the following on Termux: wget 'https://philosopher.life'

Yes, sir.

[[Variety Creepy]]
12:45 AM

It's saying that program wget is not installed

[[h0p3]]
12:45 AM

cool, it gives a command to install wget, run that

[[Variety Creepy]]
12:48 AM

Oh yeah, it's running

[[h0p3]]
12:48 AM

Dope.

[[Variety Creepy]]
12:50 AM

Repository is under maintenance

[[h0p3]]
12:50 AM

Hrm. Alright, welp, let's try Resilio Sync.

[[Variety Creepy]]
12:50 AM

Okay

I entered the key link

And created a folder.

[[h0p3]]
12:52 AM

Noice.

I see you there, Redmi Note 7 Pro. Files otw.

[[Variety Creepy]]
12:53 AM

What the heck? How did you...

Yeah, that's my phone model

But pretty sure the device name is Skanda's Redmi.

[[h0p3]]
12:55 AM

Resilio Sync is amazing for synchronizing files between all your devices. Could be as simple as keeping all your documents or music on all your devices. It's encrypted and P2P. No central server required. You devices form your own cloud.

[[Variety Creepy]]
12:56 AM

Oh... I get it now

[[h0p3]]
12:56 AM

I can't English. 4 drinks in tonight. We partied. =)

[[Variety Creepy]]
12:56 AM

Hey no problem!

What did you drink? :?

:)*

[[h0p3]]
12:57 AM

Honey Whiskey and beer

My younger brothers and I sat around our machines and talked about our days, sipping.

[[Variety Creepy]]
12:57 AM

That's nice!

[[h0p3]]
12:57 AM

Hell yeah

[[Variety Creepy]]
12:57 AM

Scotch Whisky or Bourbon?

[[h0p3]]
12:58 AM

Bourbon

I don't know much about alcohol*

[[Variety Creepy]]
12:58 AM

Amazing

I don't even drink alcohol but I just like knowing things. XD

[[h0p3]]
12:58 AM

I lived in Kentucky and Tennessee for most of my life though. I've been to the distilleries that make this shit. Neat stuff.

I think it's worth having been drunk once, but avoiding it otherwise is quite rational, imho.

[[Variety Creepy]]
12:59 AM

That's really cool. I wanna visit a distillery one day. I'm curious.

[[h0p3]]
1:00 AM

Most of them give you free drinks too.

(though, when I visited, I wasn't old enough, and I was opposed to drinking entirely at the time, so...I didn't)

[[Variety Creepy]]
1:00 AM

Yeah, I am interested in trying alcohol once but no. I know what kind of a person I am. I would get addicted to it for sure , so no way. :)

[[h0p3]]
1:00 AM

Highly unlikely. There are very few substances that cause psychological or physical dependence upon a single use.

[[Variety Creepy]]
1:01 AM

That's cool! Yeah, People change through the years. I'm glad you enjoy alcohol.

[[h0p3]]
1:01 AM

This is an interesting site (who knows how you might change in college): https://psychonautwiki.org/

Harm reduction is worth understanding even if you never use.

[[Variety Creepy]]
1:02 AM

That's true, but judging by the person who I am, I just don't trust myself with these. There's a 40 year old Scotch Whisky in my house but I never drank. A few bottles of Vodka and Brandy. I don't think it's my thing.

Okay, I'm checking the website now

[[h0p3]]
1:04 AM

Should be able to open the index.html file sitting in the sync in your browser(s).

Brave and Chrome both use the same underlying engine, so if those fail (and I would be surprised if Chrome failed), then try Firefox.

[[Variety Creepy]]
1:05 AM

This website is working.

[[h0p3]]
1:06 AM

Links can work for you, just chop off the prefix and use the file's address instead.

e.g.

becomes

foobarfiledirectorystructure/#Music%3A%20Library

[[Variety Creepy]]
1:08 AM

Wait. The philosopher website is now working!

[[h0p3]]
1:08 AM

Nifty!

[[Variety Creepy]]
1:08 AM

Yaay!

Okay so how do I add you on Session?

[[h0p3]]
1:12 AM

Grab the key off the contact page, and add it ("+" symbol  to add a session).

I realize, reading the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 on a phone isn't fun, particularly with the ASCII Art.

[[Variety Creepy]]
1:15 AM

5249578e4cdfaec1484f0083df3e8b6e4af0cab0288c8156c31d6e94efe58308

Is this the code?

[[h0p3]]
1:16 AM

Nope, that's the ed25519 key.

You want the "session: 05c..." key.

[[Variety Creepy]]
1:16 AM

Ohh

Found it!

Hello
Hey!
=). We are off plebbit.
Yessss!!!  Bye bye plebbit!!!
How's your day been?
It has been excellent. I'm eating breakfast right now:)
How was your day?
Gonna write about it in [[CTS]]. It was excellent. Can't say my offspring tried to do their schoolwork, but everything else was fulfilling. 
What do you eat for breakfast? 
That's nice
Since I am an Indian, breakfast is really important for us.
I'm eating something called chapati today. It's a type of flat bread.
Along with a side made of cowpeas
We eat a lot of other food for breakfast. Indian food has a lot of variety for all the 3 meals of the day. And even a ton of snacks too!
Indian foods^^tm^^ that we can find in the US are a delicacy to us. You might have the best food on the planet. 
Super jelly.
Ahhh. I can give you a list of food to try.
The vegetable gravy's of Indian food are amazing. I never grew up hating vegetables. The spices make it taste heavenly.
Agreed.
What all Indian food have you tried?
There are few cuisines that can be purely vegetarian and flawless at the same time. Indian is the best at it. 
Oh, the list is fairly long, and I don't remember all the names of the foods I've tried. I get it every chance I can. My brother is a sous chef, and he's had lots of Indian chefs as co-workers who have worked with him to make Indian food. We can't afford to go out to eat except on special occasions, but my brother will sometimes make various dishes for us. 
Yep. 30% of Indians are vegetarian, so we have a lot of variety. Most of the vegetarian dishes are just traditional non vegetarian dishes where they have replaced the meat with vegetables that suit the most. The nonvegetarian dishes are amazing.
Oh okay. You can find the recepies online too. YouTube is a great resource and I can give you a few amazing channels for Indian food.
I used to live in Thailand, and we were friends with Indian restaurant owners there too. Pretty similar to what we had in the states, but I've never actually visited yrou country. I'm unable to know. One of my favorite professors, Saint Husain Sarkar, would have us over to dinner too. Wherever I can find it.
Yes. That has helped tremendously. 
Thailand? Amazing! Indian and Thai food are almost similar. The only difference is that they use wet spices but we dry them up and then use it. Now is not the right time to visit India. Not in a few years. The situation here is not good for visiting. I'll let you know when to do so. Things are getting a bit out of hand here.
Yes, sir. 
Do you find Indian food spicy?
Yes, some Indian dishes I've had are spicy (my favorites are). I have tried many of the hottest peppers in the world (not enjoyable). I've never had an Indian dish too spicy (and I always ask for maximum heat). I want to sweat when I eat it. =)
That's good to hear. Wow, even Bhut Jolokia and Carolina Reaper? I don't have the guts to try them. Damn, I'm gonna ask the same thing when I go to a restaurant next time. Let's see how much spice I can tolerate ;)
The reaper, yes. Just a tiny, tiny bit. Hotter than fuck. 
I like watching daredevils do crazy shit with those kinds of peppers. Saw a video of a dude rip some on a bong once. I'm pretty sure he had to go to the hospital. 
The only reason I asked that question is because I've had many people tell me that Western food is tasteless. Many people find it hard to adapt when the move to Europe or North America. So I wanted to make sure that I wouldn't go through the same. I'm glad to know that.
Oh my gosh. Now I want to try a reaper
Bhut jolokia is also known as ghost pepper. Are you sure you've not tried it?
Many Western foods are severely lacking. The (terrible) joke is that the British were so imperialistic because their food was so bland. 
I didn't know it had that name. 
Whoa... Yeah, straight to the hospital for sure.
I like watching daredevils do crazy shit with those kinds of peppers. Saw a video of a dude rip some on a bong once. I'm pretty sure he had to go to the hospital. 
However, I think metropolitan areas in the US have among the greatest diversity of foods I've found anywhere. 
 I've heard that too. Also the East India Company went all over the world for spices and still British food doesn't taste good

My birth city, Chicago, at least back when I was born, had many sections of town where English wasn't the primary language. Name a major area in the world, and you'd find a cultural section for it. 
I will have to agree with that. The vast amount of migration of people from all over the world makes it an amazing place for anyone who is interested in trying variety.
However, I think metropolitan areas in the US have among the greatest diversity of foods I've found anywhere. 
Oh nice. I have an aunt living there. Yeah, America is truly the land of immigrants.
My birth city, Chicago, at least back when I was born, had many sections of town where English wasn't the primary language. Name a major area in the world, and you'd find a cultural section for it. 
Much of the limitation faced for cuisine here is a lack of product. Too many kinds of raw products can't be found for a reasonable price. 
Cool. You get to visit her here ever?
I agree with that.
Much of the limitation faced for cuisine here is a lack of product. Too many kinds of raw products can't be found for a reasonable price. 
No, I don't get to visit her there in Chicago. My parents don't have the need to go there so I don't. Dad videocalls her sometimes.
Small world, sir. =)
Haha yep. You're absolutely right, sir!
I have a few relatives in Iowa, Pennsylvania, California, NYC, and in another state whose name I forgot
All over, then. Cool. 
I assume, long-term, with the continued burgeoning of India (and the decline of the US), it may make more sense for you to continue living in India for much of your life.
Shit might be fucked everywhere though?
I doubt India will reach the state of glory it had before the British occupation. India will grow for sure, but I don't see it happening by at least 2050.
I don't want to waste another 30 years of my life here. And it's the prime time of my life. So no, it won't make sense living in India now.

China, thus far, has been power-winner. 
Also, judging by the way things are heading internally over here, I won't be surprised if there is a civil war by the end of the decade.

I imagine your father has been exceptionally busy in modeling and thinking about currencies lately. 
Ah. What do you think is the central cause of what may be a civil war?
Yeah, a decisive victory for China. It will be the next country after USA to control the world. But there is also a chance that China might break up into tiny parts.
China, thus far, has been power-winner. 
Well, if you ever need a place to stay in the US, you may stay with us for as long as you need. 
Nah, I doubt that. He's just doing his work.
I imagine your father has been exceptionally busy in modeling and thinking about currencies lately. 
(There are very good schools in our area. You might consider applying to them.)
A whole multitude of reasons. There's a lot of hatred for North India in the southern states because most of the income of the nation is in South India but most of the expenditure is in North India. North India has a lot of population, so they control the union government easily. The communalisation of religions is also another thing. We already have had India divided into India and Pakistan. Now there are religious fanatic Hindus who hate Muslims. It's really getting out of hand.The country is failing. There is a lot of resentment over a lot of things.
Ah. What do you think is the central cause of what may be a civil war?
I am surprised to hear your theory that China would break up into tiny parts. That may be. I do not know enough. I've been under the impression that their central planning was fairly stable, but perhaps dominoes in their dark money markets could lead to a collapse like that. 
Thanks a lot. I will be doing my Masters in the US and I don't doubt that I want to return back here anytime
Well, if you ever need a place to stay in the US, you may stay with us for as long as you need. 
Nice! Where do you live in the US?
(There are very good schools in our area. You might consider applying to them.)
I am right next to Yale. Not famous for the sciences though, sadly. 
It will. The only reason it is glued together is because of the CCP. There are people who are frustrated because of it.

Amazing!
I am right next to Yale. Not famous for the sciences though, sadly. 
It has been. We have been extremely fortunate.
My plan was to get into a college near NYC in Los Angeles. I've lived in Bangalore all my life. I doubt that it will be easy for me to adapt to a small town kind of place. But if I get a good college, I'm don't care if it is a cosmopolitan city or a tiny town.
I went to Berea College. I do not know if you have a great deal of wealth or not. Everyone who goes to Berea goes for free, and they require a certain percentage of their students come from outside the US.
You should check it out. 
You really are lucky. You live really close to New York.
Yes. I never go, lmao.
My parents have a net worth of about 1 million dollars approx. Give or take a 100 thousand dollars. But most of them are not in solid assets.
I went to Berea College. I do not know if you have a great deal of wealth or not. Everyone who goes to Berea goes for free, and they require a certain percentage of their students come from outside the US.
Is that considered wealthy?
Yes.
Oh okay lol
Yes. I never go, lmao.
Well, then you will probably be in good shape then. 
I doubt that it will be free of international students. Nothing is free for us in the US, haha.
I went to Berea College. I do not know if you have a great deal of wealth or not. Everyone who goes to Berea goes for free, and they require a certain percentage of their students come from outside the US.
No. It is free.
For*
I doubt that it will be free of international students. Nothing is free for us in the US, haha.
There are no schools like that one. It has a special history. 
Really? Wow. I really need to check that out then
No. It is free.
What is the history about?
A history of serving the poor and especially the different and the hated. They were multi-cultural long before it was cool. 
They exist in a place that supported slavery in our civil war, and Berea was a beacon against such things (quite unpopular). 
Their endowment is second only to Harvard's, I believe. 
Oh my gosh. That's really good! I'm happy for that.
Whoa
Their endowment is second only to Harvard's, I believe. 
They pay for everything from the interest of the endowment and donations. That's why every student pays zero tuition. 
Damn, that's crazy
Oh no. I does not offer any Master's degree.
However, they only serve the poor (defined by your parents income rather than wealth* surprisingly, I believe). 
It doesn't. Still worth looking into. 
It*
Oh no. I does not offer any Master's degree.
Nice. Let's see what my parents' income has to say. Their income is a lot less when it is converted to dollars :)
However, they only serve the poor (defined by your parents income rather than wealth* surprisingly, I believe). 
Oh okay.
It doesn't. Still worth looking into. 
I'm doing my bachelor's in India. I want to get it done here because I have a lot of plans that I need to do in my city. There are a bunch of colleges in Bangalore. I'm gonna join one here.
Cool. What plans you got?
Learning how to play drums or any other instrument. My brother and I want to set up a mini electronic lab in the house. I cannot use it if I'm not here in the city. A few more things like playing video games and there's a lot of stuff I didn't get to do when I was a child. These 4 years are the last chance.
College in India isn't as hectic as it is in the US. We get a lot of free time. So, it's my time to do whatever I want!
Yes, sir.
I want to do things like going to a skateparks. Tons of stuff that I have never tried. Also, it saves money if I stay in India for 4 years.
By the way, did you get vaccinated?
Yeah. I was lucky to get my J&J early in April (had to fight to get it). They wouldn't let people my age get it in my state until April unless they had a special reason (which, I technically could qualify for, but I consider it dishonest and waste of resources for those who need it even more than I do). 
My offspring just got their first shot on Saturday (it's not been made available to young persons until quite recently). 
It's been a clusterfuck. Lol.
My in-laws are opposed to vaccinations, previously claimed covid is a hoax, conspiracy theories, etc. 
Aint no reasoning with them about it. It's purely political theatre. 
Do you skate or skateboard?
Hey it's fine. Doesn't matter. There are a lot of vaccines that are wasted. It's bette to fight and get it. That's how my parents got their second dose.
Yeah. I was lucky to get my J&J early in April (had to fight to get it). They wouldn't let people my age get it in my state until April unless they had a special reason (which, I technically could qualify for, but I consider it dishonest and waste of resources for those who need it even more than I do). 
Same here. Vaccines for people under 18 is still not allowed
My offspring just got their first shot on Saturday (it's not been made available to young persons until quite recently). 
Indian government didn't expect a second wave at all lmao. They exported a lot of vaccines to other countries and now there is a vaccine shortage.
It's been a clusterfuck. Lol.
I've had people like that too but none of them are close relatives, so I don't care whether they're dead or alive. Survival of the fittest Lol

Yup. Same here

I really want to try skateboarding. I have one but I never had a place where I could. All of the skateparks are way too far
Do you skate or skateboard?
Are you legally obligated to skateboard in a park? (I was a skateboarder for several years in my youth, and it is part of punk culture that one would skate where it is not legal).
I beg you wear your safety equipment. 
Seen some nasty shit.
No I'm not obligated. Skateboarding in the open in India will assure you a bunch of nasty looks from people. I don't want that and the roads are not smooth enough of skateboarding.
Yes, I will wear my safety equipment.
Smiling back at the nasty looks is part of skateboarding culture. =)
It's a lifestyle, broski. lmao
I know lol but there will also be some weird looks from people like, "What the fuck is this kid doing?"
Fuck em. Nail that kickflip.
Hahaha yeah, I really don't know how to do a kickflip
But I wish I could
I'm really sorry for the late response. I was ironing my clothes. I'm getting my first dose today.
Naw, don't worry. I'm going to leave you hanging often (way longer). I do respond, though I sometimes take a while (my letters are especially slow in some cases). 
Well, Youtube that kickflip shit, practice in your basement (or wherever your mom won't be pissed). 
Can you start a skater gang?
Oh okay.

Eat breakfast, read Marx, skate or die.
I live in an apartment right now so maybe simeti later on the street.

Sounds like a good day.
No I cannot.
Can you start a skater gang?
Yep.
Eat breakfast, read Marx, skate or die.
Trust me, it is.
