Talk about autonomy, this is fucking autonomy, yo. Talking to yourself (or yourselves) is what allows you to unify yourself into one person.

There be some internalism up in here.

There is a perhaps neverending rotations between the slave and master, [[FO]] and [[SO]] versions of ourselves. Two or more non-conscious computer networks/modules inside us memetically and biologically competing and cooperating. We have to bring out the best in this dialectic, and we should do so computationally. It's all feedback loops.
