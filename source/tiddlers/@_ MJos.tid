I'm glad to hear life is [[going well|https://www.maxwelljoslyn.com/2022/02/12/1]] for you, sir. Thank you for the update.

Thank you for the update, sir. 

* What differences are you finding/experiencing between the two places?
* Congratulations on finishing your first quarter. I assume it's been a blast for you.
* Did you end up using a tool like GPT-3 for automated game design? How'd you do it?
* Hopefully the amusement park is not coming to an end, but just one iteration of it. 
** I could imagine that [[sharing]] similar backends and work processes provides a great space in which to bounce ideas and make them come alive.
* Do the girls like to write poetry with you? I wish you all the best of [[luck]] in your collaboration, sir. =D. 
* I am relieved to hear that your hands provide you at least a couple hours! I am [[hope]]ful (though it's not my prediction yet) that you'll see continued improvement.

XD. I'll do what I can. Marking my [[calendar]], sir. I've a doctor's appointment with the fam for shots during that time period. I can get the flushot later though (pending [[my wife]]'s approval* - my argument will be that I'm basically perma-quarantined as it is). I'd rather hear your voice anyway.

I appreciate the summary. It's nice to have something ambitiously fun also be ambitiously useful elsewhere.

Iirc you attended last year; will you grace the sequel  with your presence?

Perhaps not, if you are currently reply-only. As you will...

The quarter started Monday and classes start tomorrow. Already had my first meeting with my advisor to discuss my research direcion, which will roughly be "create cyborg-computerized tabletop RPG, focusing on prog. languages for data reprsentation and UI for realtime creationg/editing/deployment of said data during RPG sessions ..  use results there to generalize to other forms of 'knowledge work'.

Tha's the summary. Have to run. Cheers,

I had a feeling she might. :P.

Good God, [[MJos]]: I am blind with jealousy and envious beyond words. `/smh`. I can feel my heartbeat. Literally. I cannot even ''begin'' to describe it. You are the [[Luuuuuucccccccccckiiiiiiiiest|Luck]]!! I ask you a favor, sir: if you get to do more than lunch, go letterboxing with her (somewhere near the beach, I [[hope]] - she needs more sunlight). That is what I would do in your shoes. I hope you have the time of your lives.

As to the [[privacy]] concern, I'm glad you asked. I appreciate your offer, and I'm honored to be included. You are correct that I would not be able to guarantee my [[silence]] (only two have that standing right with me), and even if you relaxed your requirement of me, I would still prefer to wrestle with your public-facing information. I know that isn't ideal, but I think it's our best option.

I understand completely that when I email you, even though I think of email is somewhat private, that you were going to wiki what I write. No biggie, no shiggie.

But when I upgrade my website with private posts, and give you maximum priority all levels access to what I write, I need to know that you will not wiki anything which is access protected. That’s only fair, right?

Obviously you are allowed to say no, if it violates your principles. I just need to know in advance.

My addiction to emailing people I meet online has, this year, lead to a number of Online friendships converting into f2f. And check this out, bon homie: none other than Sphygmus<<footnote "<1>" "not to be confused with my good friend in Rome, Shigmus Digmus. ">> saw my email on your wiki, about moving to SC, and she reached out to say that she’ll be in SC in December and that we should meet up and have lunch.

I said yes of course! Talk about harvesting the fruits of the online orchard. I’m excited to meet a fellow PSMer,  Especially as I will be more worthy of the mantle by December (sooner, hopefully, but I’m trusting the process that I’m going through with sensei, And he just brought a site online with his whole stack so I know that the good fruits are about to get juiced.) pretty sure I’ve been to her website a few times,… Actually no not yet, I’m confusing her with chameleon (F). So I have to peep her next week and do the hokey pokey of learning what she’s all about.

I imagine you’ve already Reply Moded yesterday’s email but I haven’t  noodled the wiki yet. I’ll save it for when I’m sober. ;-)

[[2021-03-27|https://www.maxwelljoslyn.com/blog]] I lost my phone. Please only contact me by email until this message is removed.

That sucks, dude! =/. Hopefully, it won't be hard to replace. I wonder how your phone can be tailored further to aid you in your fight against your ailment. 

As usual, I will be leaving my messages for you in the [[ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱]].

...I can’t think of a single measly incentive for me to share political opinions on the Web. (Improving them through private debate is another matter.)

I'm honored that you may have already broken what is presumably one of your rules here. I appreciate your honesty. That's quite a gift. Thank you.
