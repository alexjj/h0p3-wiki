title: 2020.09.28 - Prompted Introspection: Can barely live with 'em, can't live without 'em

!! What is the biggest trigger for stress in your life?

Humans. Can barely live with 'em, can't live without 'em. The schizo feedback loop of increasing rejection based on blink-of-an-eye-unexamined difference (and dishonest laziness in dialectics) is so strong in my life that I've almost arrived at a learned-helplessness, almost a [[hope]]lessness, almost a sufficient state for convincing me to give up. I have a profound hikki luxury in even having the option to escape. I do largely escape. My home is a sanctuary nested inside the prison of billions of people. I have the profound luxury of having met [[others]] that don't drive me insane too. 

Relationships are intense for me. Most people don't realize it at all. If they were faced with the stress of it, I don't think they would leave their huts either. Reduced to mere transactional relationships, most people never spend even a 10th of the computation and cortisol that I have on them; it's not conducive to trust.
