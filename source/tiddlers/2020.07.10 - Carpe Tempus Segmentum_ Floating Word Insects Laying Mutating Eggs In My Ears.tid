title: 2020.07.10 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Floating Word Insects Laying Mutating Eggs In My Ears

* Woke at 11
** Good sleep. This week's sleep has been fantastic (all over the place, but I feel better).
** Before I fell asleep the night before, I heard my wife asking my son why he was up at 5 washing his hands. Apparently, he had left a hot plate on in his room and someone touched it in the middle of the night? (I suspect someone was playing vidya).
*** Hand looks fine, thankfully.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Wife walked me through her insane morning.
* Cleaning
* Sent offspring to pickup the tools, but it started to rain (they brought an umbrella, but meh). Put away the walkie-talkies.
* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
* IRS is clogged up. No go again.
* Asking my wife to just take the rest of the day off (and to veg tomorrow too). Forget spending time with us. Just chill.
* Walk+Talk
* Continue to attempt to persuade my offspring to organize.
** Not great. Not awful.
* Vapelyfe
* Grafting. Yeah, loser, get in there! =)
* Read+Write
* Chats
* Talked with [[DeathOfRobinhood]]
** He's feeling practical in his home construction, building his material workings and directing his energy with his wife.
** He's having folks over for dinner several times with week. Hospitality. Dope.
*** I'm jelly that he gets to live in the same area his entire life here. I aint got them roots. =/.
** I can see I pair best with hyperobservant people.
** The Good Wolf
*** I got to hear his pitch. It's well done.
*** The Magic of his stories, Reification of what he values
** Side-project
** Graphic novels
** He's losing his best two animators most likely (though better odds than initially assumed). 
*** He's teaching more effectively, making things explicit. 
**** I think he's a much better teacher than he thinks. He says it is because I'm listening, but I heard that and I still disagree.
** Mathematician friend was over.
** Thinking about apocalypse and status quo stability.
** He essentially works for Canadian PBS. That's sick. 
*** I gave one of my definitions of a hacker. 
** He's had a really good week.
