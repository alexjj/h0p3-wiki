title: 2022.02.23 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Campaign Finance Reform Mouthmoney

Woke at 8:30 to my sympaticon's coughing. Δ⁸ is harsh, especially on sensitive systems. [[Killcoin]] knows [[hao]] [[itdo]]. Long meditation. Tox's beep acquired my {[[Focus]]}; either an [[anonomad]] or someone quite close. Hugs with my sympaticon before jumping into my battlestation wrapped in my blanket. It's [[Variety Creepy]]! Chocolate ganache leftover in the fridge (this is edible with a spoon, right? :P) and tea.

Catching up with my daughter. Pushed brix. Fireman Time! Catching up with my son. Planning. [[TTTOTW]].

Sammiches with my sympaticon. Made it there, minus the construction detour, without aid.

Shopping @ Aldi with my sympaticon. Music and dancing in the store. A light shopping, no doubt. No food coloring, so we will hit W-Entity later. A sinister encounter. I asked [[ASK]] to leave me for a minute. I never see anyone shoplifting food. Someone was switching labels. An old Chinese man dropped his money, but refused to take it back. I do not know what to think of the matter. The major frozen section was empty. We had a good time.

My son came down to grind. Finalizing some paperwork. We may come up short this round.

Took my sympaticon to the DMV. 

//The Walk// with... me, myself, and my retard.<<ref "o">> I walked along the perimeter, snapped dead branches, felt grass, listened to the many gunshots (presumably, a gun range somewhere nearby). [[Music]] took me away. [[TTTOTW]]. Trouble logging into [[m16]] remotely without zerotier from my wireless carrier, `/sigh`. 

Tired. //Skintime// with my sympaticon + //ATLA//. Mi amor told me to join her when we were done. 

//The Walk// with mi amor. Somehow went from shorts weather to chilly in a split second. I needed it. Thank you. Rabbitholes and teasing. Took a much shorter route, as she is in pain.

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. She's prepared for the possibility that she won't be heading into work on Friday as well. Thinking about two conferences this year, her application process, new student workers (can just hire them when she wants, and I'm so not used to this...so dope<<ref "d">>). Fireman Time! 

Finished off dinner, everyone kinda chilled in the kitchen for a bit. [[ASK]] added onions, cheese, and some turkey cuts to mine...it fuckin' worked, yo. We kept baking the pizzas until they had the texture I preferred. `/nod`. 

[[Family Gathering]] was solid. My daughter generally compares me to House himself twice an episode, booing, hissing, spitting venom, throwing rotten tomato arguments that parallel her life whenever she can. It did not go as she planned, again. Devastating arguments echoing. I know where I am not that [[character|Identifying With: Fictional Characters]] with sustained, open proof to boot. She noped out. `/nod`. 

Taxes. Offspring led the charge. Dialecture. Smooth enough this year. 

Crack in the toilet can't be solved except by replacement. One-piece would be nice, but seems expensive. Also, [[k0sh3k]]'s phone is officially incompatible with our carrier, `/sigh`. It's only a few years old. Ridiculous. As many squeezes as I could squeeze out of her. Put mi amor to bed. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Still thinkin' about [[Impassionata]]. Can't say we'd get along, but I [[aim]] to be useful to them nonetheless (and I'm [[grateful]] they exist and that I also get to see some of their work).

Woke my sympaticon from what I believe was a night terror. She sounds like she is in pain. I don't like waking her when she's on such little sleep as it is. It must be done. She wasn't in a comfortable position anyway, so eventually put her back to sleep.

<<footnotes "d" "Perhaps the most dope part is that she has only amazing picks the entire time. It's 98% signal. Seems nearly impossible. An oasis. Seminary/div students (minus the music prima donnas) have tended to be excellent students, people, co-workers, etc...even the rest of the Y-Entity's managers seem to agree. Jelly AF.">>
