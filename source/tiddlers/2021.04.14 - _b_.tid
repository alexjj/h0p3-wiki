Not that I ping people in my social circles these days (they didn't evaporate, but most have a slower pace and shallower commitment), but even when I do: I tend not to ping people at the edges of my social circles (though I want to often enough!). There are exceptions where I do know someone you know, but I rarely find it my fitting place to do so. I work to be second-personally directed; it's how I interpret the essence of respect for [[others]] at the bottom. Having been trapped in many kinds and sizes of Karpman Drama Triangles (Persecutor, Rescuer, Victim), being weary of the various spectacles and simulations I've encountered, and the possibility that I cost my initial interlocutor something with another friend of theirs just in virtue of the fact that I'm insane: I've grown perhaps too hesitant. I have a difficult time generalizing and transfering trust from one compartment (a redflag word, surely) to another too (including just trusting myself). As a matter of positivistic game-theoretic praxis, the dialectical slave or losing side is hypothetically obligated to take greater risks to secure their victory.

Creativity [[FTSO]] [[W5H]]? The hacker ethos dies in practice when all technical bodies have become negotiating tables for corporations to divvy up turf. Don't hack just because it's cool or fun. Hack because you've lost or will lose someone that matters in the world. Whose suffering is worth suffering for? There are billions of ultimate reasons worth hacking for, none of them money.

There are parts of your moral agency, identity, and epistemic map that we shouldn't take seriously if you aren't willing to take them seriously either. It's well beyond the initial skin in the game requirement for empathy too. It is here that the constructivists in metaethics have a point (though there is such a thing as immoral agency and immoral identities [and hence bad as well]). In many cases, I have a right to dismiss evil, and, in others, even an obligation to dispense with evil. There are strong reasons to prefer holding the scope of the [[4DID]] as the primary face and identity of [[the other]].

Among others things, trolling me may lead to spontaneous, seemingly-non-consensual personal growth for both of us.
