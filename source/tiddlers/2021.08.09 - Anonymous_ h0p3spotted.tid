You: Hello. =)
Stranger: Hey what‚Äôs up
You: Not much. I've had a lot of failed conversations on Omegle today. Pretty normal, I think.
You: How about you?
Stranger: Aw I‚Äôm sorry that sounds about right though for here
You: Yeah, lol.
You: [[Anonymous]] people tend to behave differently than they would in meatspace or even in virtual settings where they had more skin in the game.
You: What brings you here today?
Stranger: I‚Äôm just laying down feeling super restless to be honest like if I had a car I‚Äôd be out doing some impulsive shit haha
Stranger: What do you mean by meatspace
You: You like to drive around and enjoy the breeze?
Stranger: Yes to be honest I do
You: Uh, I mean, the standard "IRL" not on our computers kind of context. Face to face discussions are a fine example.
You: I can appreciate that.
You: I take it you aren't able to do that at the moment.
Stranger: You‚Äôre trying to talk face to face right now?
You: In a manner of speaking, I think that's fair to say. Yes.
You: I'm here to speak with people as though they were right in front of me.
Stranger: Oh I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt do that right now
You: Oh. Seems like we are doing that right now.
You: But, don't feel obligated to speak unless you really want to.
You: Why do you think you're feeling so restless?
Stranger: I thought you meant video chat
Stranger: Maybe I have brain difficulties
You: Oh. Naw, I prefer text for many reasons.
You: I have those too. =)
Stranger: I always misinterpret things for one
You: Oh, preach, yo.
Stranger: Simple things
Stranger: I might have a hint out autism
Stranger: Of *
You: I am autistic. I empathize with that.
You: I can imagine many people aren't kind to you here on Omegle.
Stranger: Do you notice it in me?
You: I can't say I do, but I'm not skilled enough in modeling my interlocutors.
Stranger: You‚Äôre super smart though
You: I'm fully retarded in many respects though. XD. My family forgives me often.
You: You got any folks in your life that treat you right?
Stranger: Yeah
You: Good.
Stranger: I felt what you said in my soul
You: Wow. That is high praise. I wish I knew how to speak to people's hearts more often.
You: Can I show you who I am (I know it will look crazy, but maybe after some time, you will think me worth your time)?
You: I keep a journal online.
You: Sometimes I'm able to build relationships with it, as people can see inside, interpret who I am with more context and depth than I'd normally be able to achieve in other settings.
Stranger: That‚Äôs sounds great.
Stranger: I‚Äôd love to check it out
You: Please do not judge the book by it's cover (you don't seem the sort to make that mistake), and I know it's absurd looking, but I am happy to speak at great length about whatever is valuable to you: https://philosopher.life/
You: My son, [[1uxb0x]] (this is a link in this wiki, https://philosopher.life/#1uxb0x) is also autistic. We are like brothers.
Stranger: I will definitely check it out
You: This might be a very relevant article to our particular conversation: https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1362361320919286
You: Sometimes autists are able to speak with other autists quite effectively (compared to how they might interact with other neurotypicals).
Stranger: Nice!!!
You: What sorts of things interest you the most?
You: (Also, please feel free to take your time. I [[aim]] to be a patient interlocutor. I'm in no rush.)
Stranger: Big booty hoes
You: Haha
Stranger: Just kidding
You: I think that's a fine answer, of course. XD.
Stranger: You too?
You: Who doesn't love a good butt?
Stranger: Yes
Technical error: Server was unreachable for too long and your connection was lost. Sorry. :( Omegle understands if you hate it now, but Omegle still loves you.

I'm sorry, my friend! This is terrible. You were writing for so long. I take it you were the person I was hoping to speak with all night. =(. It's rare that I get to speak with someone who know this feel. I will bend over backwards to [[help]] you construct a wiki; it may aid you. I wish you [[luck]] beyond words, [[nomad]]. `/bow`.

You: I hear that. That seems a common reason I find.
You: I'm here to [[Find The Other]], as I normally think of it.
Stranger: Are you a bot ?
You: Talking to people I've never met before, hoping to understand who we are.
You: No.
You: Do you need proof?
Stranger: Nope this is enough
You: I am regularly accused of it.
You: `/salute`
Stranger: Sorry I'm amused of your english
You: My English is terrible. I'm sorry.
Stranger: That's really nice
Stranger: Ngl
You: Well, as long as I'm amusing, something decent has come about. XD.
Stranger: And you're typing so fast üòÖ
You: What do you like to do for amusement, my friend?
You: I've some practice.
You: I adore my [[computer]].
Stranger: Ohh cool
Stranger: Lol
Stranger: I just listen to some songs
You: Hell yeah.
Stranger: Wbu
You: Tell me about the music you like. I am an absolute linkslut.
You: I just redid/updated my playlist: https://philosopher.life/#Music%3A%20Library
You: I do a lot of things for amusement, but rarely for the sake of amusement alone (except [[Masturbation]]).
Stranger: Hmmm actually I'm not a fan of any specific type of music but I like some songs like me too
You: That makes sense.
Stranger: Ohh ok lol
You: I don't have a particular kind of music I adore the most (though I lean instrumental). Really, it's specific songs that take my breath away.
Stranger: Ohh cool
Stranger: How long have you been programming
You: I probably do not merit the title. I've met enough programmers to believe I'm retarded, lmao. I've been using computers for 30 years.
You: How about you?
Stranger: Ohh cool
Stranger: I'm just getting started with python
You: Hell yeah!
You: Python is probably my favorite language of the bunch.
You: Get shit done in it.
You: What brought you to it?
You: https://philosopher.life/#Python%3A%20Cheatsheet
Stranger: Um inspired jarvis
You: Oh. Nifty.
You: Python is likely a fitting language for such a task, if you're interested in ML.
You: https://philosopher.life/#Aispondence
Stranger: Ummm
Stranger: Hey I really have an doubt about you
You: What doubt?
You: I'll try to alleviate it for you.
Stranger: Are you an advanced ai bot ?
You: I'm not. I've asked if you want proof. I can provide that.
You: The turing test is a hard problem.
Stranger: Cuz you're sending links in lighting speed
You: I know my way around my own ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±
You: I built it, after all. =)
Stranger: What does that mena
Stranger: Ohh cool bro
You: It's a wiki. I've been writing in it for many years. I organize my thoughts and feelings in it. It's kinda hard to describe.
Stranger: Which programming language did you used to built it
Stranger: Ohh cool
You: It's a Tiddlywiki (https://tiddlywiki.com). I use a bunch of tooling in my [[RGM]]. https://philosopher.life/#RGM
Stranger: Is it just like an personal assistant who knows a lot about you ?
You: Eh, it's a collection of plaintext files in a markup language with customized [[link]]ing and search tools (that's too short an answer).
You: I do use it like a personal assistant, but I navigate it manually.
Stranger: Ohh ok
Stranger: Have a nice day !
You: Alright, you too!
Stranger: Good bye !
You: `/wave`
Stranger has disconnected.

I must be too boring to merit a conversation. Well, I [[hope]] it was still useful to them. Not sure how to help. Maybe I can be a conduit to a worthy path for them.

Thank you for the validation. I'm sorry we didn't get to talk about much of anything. I don't know what you're looking for. We could have talked philosophy! But, I'm annoying there, I realize.
