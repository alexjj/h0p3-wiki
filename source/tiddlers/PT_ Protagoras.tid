; 481-411 BC: Protagoras

* Man is the measure of all things; what people judge to be true or valuable is so for themselves, except insofar as they are part of a larger population who overrule an individual's measurement. Intersubjectivities describe what is good.
* Good citizenship consists in justice and self-restraint as defined by the ideological models, appearances, or measurements of experts or the majority. The preservation of the social order depends upon those memeplexes, defined by men, being sufficiently inculcated in other men.
* Protagoras realpolitik rolemodeled investigating the distinction between linguistic intention and denotation for the sake of picking out the fitting institutional practice of building a civilization.
* We have neither the means of knowing whether gods exist nor the means of knowing what sort they would be if they existed.
