At least some versions of the Scout Mindset don't seem to say it quite right: seeking the truth is an identity to defend. There are epistemic contexts in which taking into account the perspectives of your allies should be enough to change your mind (and, of course, there are some in which you should be willing to stand your ground against everyone), as that may be what consists in simulating the Outsider test (for an ideal agent making decisions on your behalf in your shoes).

A lot of essential complexity, little inessential

It is difficult to know how to serve someone on the assumption they don't care about the truth.

I'm left wondering if ~~those with basic pattern recognition~~ pure schizophrenics are more likely to believe in the divine than pure autistics (insofar as they can be peeled apart, though perhaps there are options like bouncing dialectics in the chains of bayesian perception boxes to consider) because they are so inclined to perceive unity with the world to a higher degree (or, more cynically, that their perceptions of their own egos is artificially extended). Yet, I also think the autist, in this case, may be presented with more proof-theoretic and mechanical pointers toward that which is divine in [[The Other]]. The subject/object distinction is bare: that is not me.

"We can disagree and still be friends" may just be claiming that we can "love our enemies". Quite roughly, be quick to [[love]], slow to [[like]].
