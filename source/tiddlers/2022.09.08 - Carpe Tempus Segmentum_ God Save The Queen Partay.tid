//Another one bites the dust.//

LolVod + [[TTTOTW]].

A wild [[shmup]] appears...

Sleep by 7?

Woke at noon. Solid. Meditation. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Dialecture. They will eventually get it. ⁸Δ⁸ + Clarinet. Applied a no-slip surface to the bottom of the tub. Seems alright so far.

A wild [[snessim]] appears...

Chat with [[shmup]] and [[ilmu]]. [[TTTOTW]].

//The Walk// with mi amor. Clarinet. Thinkin' about all the folks I've talked with today. Onto pass fail. She had no downtime today, but it was a good thing, not overwhelming. No anxiety of wondering why she is there wasting her time. Promotion material updated. Spoke with the GILF: [[smalltalk]], honey. Saw Elaine from a distance. 

A very brief chat with [[j3d1h]]'s C. People are often surprised I don't have a very deep voice to go along with my intimidating beliefs and words. `/nod`. Seemed cool, though his inferences were mistaken. We were both nervous, of course. Cool kid.

[[Family Gathering]] was good. We toasted to her majesty's death. Tango down. May the capitalist class die quickly. Very stirring words to go with our fizzy purple drank. We had hotdogs and water. Chopped spicy pickles were a hit. `/nod`. //House of Cards//. 

Put my sympaticon to bed: migraine. [[TTTOTW]]. Put mi amor to bed. LolVods with my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]].
