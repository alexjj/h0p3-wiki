How has your week been, sir?
Jul 24 3:57pm
Slavin to the man. Lol. You?
Jul 24 6:57pm
Daughter forgot a few of her multiplication tables again. Had to make her go back thru her flash cards and test out.
Jul 24 6:58pm
Oh my god. My daughter had to relearn those fucking tables 4 times. I still don't believe she knows them.
Jul 24 8:24pm
You on call this weekend?
Jul 24 8:25pm
Sunday. Drinking tonight. On last beer.  =(
Jul 24 11:54pm

You eber drank mouthwash to kicknit up a notch?
Jul 25 1:59am
I haven't. I've swallowed it before, but it never did anything for me.
Jul 25 1:53pm
Do you suffer from self loating?
Jul 25 2:16pm
I think I need to see a shrink.
Jul 25 2:16pm
Of course
Jul 25 2:16pm
Probably worth hunting for the right counselor.
Jul 25 2:16pm
I have had a few. Outgrew them.

I've never had anything like that. Sounds like it would be really good.
Jul 26 1:00pm
It's not pizza. But it's a healthy substitute. You mix the cauliflower rice with egg and cheese, spread it and cook it for about 30 - it gets kinda crust like. Then you put your sauces cheese and toppings. And cook again.
Jul 26 1:02pm
Pretty easy to make. I forgot to take a pic of the crust after cooked.
Jul 26 1:02pm

I recommend The Boondocks. Show is hilarious, beautiful, and something to think about.

Jul 31 4:35pm
Of*
Jul 31 4:35pm
(I was mowing and it started to rain. I stopped under a tree and captured the images)
Jul 31 4:35pm

A different one. It runs and drives.
Jul 31 4:37pm
Ah
Jul 31 4:37pm
How are you and yours?
Jul 31 4:39pm
Hanging in there. Grinding along.
Jul 31 4:39pm
My girls left for Indiana this morning. I'm home alone.
Jul 31 4:39pm
Wow.
Jul 31 4:39pm
What they up to in Indiana?
Jul 31 4:39pm
You enjoying having the house to yourself?
Jul 31 4:39pm
Nah. I don't like being alone.
Jul 31 4:39pm
Me neither, lol.
Jul 31 4:39pm
They are visiting her parents. The 3 sisters all rented campers and they are put up on my in-laws property with generators and stuff. They are using his huge garage to socially distance but be together.
Jul 31 4:40pm
So each family has a camper. Mother and father in law have the house. They plan to cook seperatly but eat in garage, can shower, bathroom in campers. It's a cool idea. I woukd have went  but my job...
Jul 31 4:42pm
I hope they have fun.
Jul 31 4:43pm
I hope you will be able to find some peace too.
Jul 31 4:43pm
Got any plans for the weekend?
Jul 31 4:43pm
No. Not really. Still on the fence about quitting my job. I kinda changed jobs at a bad time.
Jul 31 4:46pm
Probabaly spend my time thinking too much. Talking/messaging a few friends. And trying to figure out life.
Jul 31 4:47pm
Lol
Jul 31 4:48pm
You guys doing anything this weekend?
Jul 31 5:17pm
Technically, supposed to party tonight, but [[k0sh3k]]'s migraine is epic. I'm going to tend to her this weekend.
Jul 31 5:18pm
Offspring owe me a great deal of work, I will ignore them not doing it as kindly as I can.
Jul 31 5:18pm
You are kind to your wife.
Jul 31 5:28pm
I could be a better husband. I think. Always feels like my emotions are holding me back.
Jul 31 5:28pm
I probably need to be more kind than most because most of the time, I'm annoying, infuriating, and it takes huge amounts of energy to listen to my gibberish.
Jul 31 5:31pm
I think it's awesome how you find ways to have fun with your family. You do a better job of it than I do by far.
Jul 31 5:31pm
I am very lazy/low key during the work week.
Jul 31 5:35pm
Understandably
Jul 31 5:35pm
I don't expend any energy after I get home. I usually take a shower, wait on my wife to make dinner, eat and spend the evening watching TV with my wife and kiddo.
Jul 31 5:36pm
I try on the weekends to do fun stuff. Sometimes. If I can manage it. Also I ignore alot of projects, work, things that need to be done.
Jul 31 5:37pm
That's life though.
Jul 31 5:37pm
Preach.
Jul 31 5:38pm
I'm happy ignoring my projects too, lol
Jul 31 5:38pm
I didn't win the lotto Wednesday. Gonna try again Sat.
Jul 31 5:38pm
Lol
Jul 31 5:38pm
lol
Jul 31 5:38pm
I don't play often. But i gotta buy one here and there.
