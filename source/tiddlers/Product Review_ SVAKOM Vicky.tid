* Tentatively P([4.52893239487234±.32034823044309]/5) = ~.6
** I hope to give this score rarely (it's so high up there). I'm not sure any improvement I could name could be accomplished at this price-point (though the price could drop perhaps), and it's non-obvious to me that there's any significant improvement to be had without way more custom private infrastructure.<<ref "m">>
** I've not put it through its long-term paces yet. Unfortunately, I'm concerned about the inability to charge it (too many vibrators fail here).
* Assuming it can be charged again and again: skip the Aneros and forget my gorgeously hand-carved prostate stimulators<<ref "AIR">> because this is it. 
** The sheer duration of the orgasms are so long and the intensity so high that I'm thinking this might be how I accidentally kick the bucket.<<ref "h">> It's going to be so embarrassing. 
*** Once I go over the edge, I just stay there. I have a hard time breathing, and I shake for 10 minutes after.
*** Accounting for all immediate hedonic tradeoffs, it's actually as good as sex with [[k0sh3k]]: that's fucking insane. 
**** I would never have guessed that was likely to be even feasible a year ago.
* Ass down on a gentle surface to maximize what this thing does. 
** Double vibration does so much work. It's not like any other vibrator I've used.
** It's pure fucking magic: I can feel it up to my chest.
** My penis becomes a mere secondary tool of stimulation: it's no longer a focal point. 
* Were I president or incredibly wealthy: I'd mass produce and distribute these to anyone with a prostate. 
** The world would be a better place if this object were common.
