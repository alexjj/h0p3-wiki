"""
My daughter laughed and said, "hey, that's you, but with your computer" to me.
Sep 11, 2020 1:46pm
Haha ðŸ˜†
Sep 11, 2020 1:47pm
You hanging in there? How's your ear?
Sep 11, 2020 1:47pm
Iâ€™m chilling
Sep 11, 2020 1:47pm
Excellent.
Sep 11, 2020 1:48pm

How's life going?
Sep 18, 2020 9:35pm
Hey! Iâ€™ll catch up with you tomorrow if thatâ€™s okay about to head to bed!
Sep 18, 2020 9:36pm
`/salute`, anytime. Sleep well.
Sep 18, 2020 9:37pm

Today actually right now is the zoom call for Neeraj.
Sep 23, 2020 2:12pm
Definitely not my favorite day
Sep 23, 2020 2:13pm
Itâ€™s his first appearance since being arrested
Sep 23, 2020 2:13pm
Kinda feel like I could throw up
Sep 23, 2020 2:14pm
It was surreal hearing [[REDACTED]]'s voice
Sep 23, 2020 2:45pm
He also plead not guilty
Sep 23, 2020 2:45pm
Lawd. That must be awful.
Sep 23, 2020 4:24pm
I can't imagine being there.
Sep 23, 2020 4:24pm
It may be the case that justice will not obtain. =/.
Sep 23, 2020 4:25pm
I was on the phone via zoom
Sep 23, 2020 7:39pm
No video or audio so I called in
Sep 23, 2020 7:39pm
Apparently itâ€™s his strategy to plead not guilty however my face being black and blue and him being in Wisconsin isnâ€™t going to help his case
Sep 23, 2020 7:40pm
Since the DA is intense and probs republican
Sep 23, 2020 7:41pm
I just have to talk to them tomorrow about the case
Sep 23, 2020 7:41pm
So letâ€™s see
Sep 23, 2020 7:41pm
That must cost a fuckton of emotional energy.
Sep 23, 2020 7:41pm
Today it was
Sep 23, 2020 7:41pm
Kinda felt weird
Sep 23, 2020 7:42pm
But I had a vet appointment for Hendrix afterwards which kept me moving
Sep 23, 2020 7:42pm
=)
Sep 23, 2020 7:42pm
And Iâ€™m dating this guy that lives in Oslo Norway so that helps keep my brain a tad busy
Sep 23, 2020 7:43pm
Heâ€™s a pro badminton player and coach
Sep 23, 2020 7:43pm
But has his masters degree in computer science and could work as a software developer but doesnâ€™t ha
Sep 23, 2020 7:43pm
Good. And, he sounds fascinating.

Sep 23, 2020 7:44pm
Yeah Iâ€™m going to Oslo in June for a couple weeks
Sep 23, 2020 7:45pm
Hopefully with the intent to move to Eastern Europe because letâ€™s be honest I deserve to be happy and have fun
Sep 23, 2020 7:45pm
Also tbh I may not get married again but Iâ€™ll be like a good European and break the social norms ha
Sep 23, 2020 7:45pm
After my experience Iâ€™m not sure marriage is necessary haha ðŸ˜†
Sep 23, 2020 7:46pm
I can appreciate the lack of meaning in the piece of paper.
Sep 23, 2020 7:46pm
Dude, you already have huge plans, lol.
Sep 23, 2020 7:47pm
I just told him weâ€™d need to negotiate co-parenting jaja
Sep 23, 2020 7:47pm
Hahaha ðŸ˜‚ Iâ€™m pretty transparent with him because while I want to have fun I donâ€™t want to waste my time or his
Sep 23, 2020 7:47pm
And Iâ€™ve always wanted to live in Europe haha he just makes that simpler since he plays a game that Americans donâ€™t ha
Sep 23, 2020 7:48pm
It's excellent to have so much to look forward to. That can be tough to achieve these days.
Sep 23, 2020 7:50pm
Yeah Iâ€™m looking into teaching English at an international school
Sep 23, 2020 7:51pm
Which Iâ€™ve always loved teaching and itâ€™d give me time to spend with Hendrix and to coach soccer too
Sep 23, 2020 7:51pm
Plus teachers in Europe are actually taken care of
Sep 23, 2020 7:52pm
Were I in your shoes, I would shoot for Scandinavia.
Sep 23, 2020 7:52pm
Haha yeah
Sep 23, 2020 7:52pm
His list is 
Denmark
Australia
Germany 
Sweden
Sep 23, 2020 7:53pm
Also Iâ€™m always going to interested in NGOâ€™s
Sep 23, 2020 7:53pm
Iâ€™m taking life a day at a time
Sep 23, 2020 7:54pm
Good
Sep 23, 2020 7:54pm
Since my employerâ€™s have been on vacay for 3 weeks
Sep 23, 2020 7:54pm
How is your job going, btw?
Sep 23, 2020 7:54pm
3, I thought it was only going to be 2?
Sep 23, 2020 7:54pm
They took another week
Sep 23, 2020 7:54pm
Lucky
Sep 23, 2020 7:55pm
That is awesome for you too
Sep 23, 2020 7:55pm
So Iâ€™ve decided Iâ€™ll go to Oslo for three weeks haha
Sep 23, 2020 7:55pm
In June since he wants us to go to S Africa as well
Sep 23, 2020 7:55pm
Itâ€™ll be the longest Iâ€™ve been away from Hendrix
Sep 23, 2020 7:57pm
I can bring him if I want but thatâ€™s a lot of work for not a lot of time
Sep 23, 2020 7:57pm
Image attached to message
Sep 23, 2020 7:57pm
Did he get bigger?
Sep 23, 2020 7:58pm
Seems taller than I remember
Sep 23, 2020 7:58pm
Image attached to message
He got shaved
Sep 23, 2020 8:00pm
I think so
Sep 23, 2020 8:00pm
Because he was matted and had fleas
Sep 23, 2020 8:00pm
So we went down to his base coat
Sep 23, 2020 8:00pm
That might be the big difference visually.

He looks like corduroy
