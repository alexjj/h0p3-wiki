* The work we are doing here is obviously more than to save one's butt and redirect liability without actually doing anything meaningful otherwise. The spiritual illness of our society is our responsibility to discover and respond to. When times are evil enough, if you aren't losing your mind (however quietly): it's a redflag that you're a sociopath. 
* The social theory of disability may suggest that mental "illness" is often constructed as a means to pathologize deviation from what may be called orthodox capitalist perspectives. Pharmaceutical interventions in those pathologies are part of capitalism's attempt to address a crisis it created, i.e., that conditions for the proletariat are so poor, and the welfare structures are so austere, that we have to chronically and sacrificially alter our brain chemistry to remain productive by an exploitative set of societal definitions. Our health system is designed to parasitically demand everything it can from customers because of the high demand inelasticity of preserving even the possibility of living a good, healthy life. In short, psychological deviation from the norm will often be punished unless it is exploitable.
* Appreciating the consequences of labeling and providing prescription, guidance, or curated information, even in an emergency, is part of our responsibility. In order to be wise first-responders, we must critically examine the degree to which psychiatry is an industrial extension of the state, serving as gateways to police forces, and oppressing those who refuse to be quietly domesticated in a fundamentally immoral system.
