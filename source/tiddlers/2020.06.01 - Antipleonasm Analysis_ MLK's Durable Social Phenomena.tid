//In honor of my brother [[AIR]].//

Urban riots must now be recognized as durable social phenomena. They may be deplored, but they are there and should be understood. Urban riots are a special form of violence. They are not insurrections. The rioters are not seeking to seize territory or to attain control of institutions. They are mainly intended to shock the white community. They are a distorted form of social protest.

The looting which is their principal feature serves many functions. It enables the most enraged and deprived to take hold of consumer goods with the ease the white man does by using his purse. Often rioters do not even want what he takes; he wants the experience of taking. But most of all, alienated from society and knowing that this society cherishes property above people, he is shocking it by abusing property rights.

There are thus elements of emotional catharsis in the violent act. This may explain why most cities in which riots have occurred have not had a repetition, even though the causative conditions remain. It is also noteworthy that the amount of physical harm done to white people other than police is infinitesimal.

A profound judgment of today's riots was expressed by Victor Hugo a century ago. He said, 'If a soul is left in the darkness, sins will be committed. The guilty one is not he who commits the sin, but he who causes the darkness.'

The policymakers of the white society have caused the darkness; they create discrimination; they structured slums; and they perpetuate unemployment, ignorance and poverty.

Day-in and day-out he violates welfare laws to deprive the poor of their meager allotments; he flagrantly violates building codes and regulations; his police make a mockery of law; and he violates laws on equal employment and education and the provisions for civic services. The slums are the handiwork of a vicious system of the white society; Black people live in them but do not make them any more than a prisoner makes a prison.

Let us say boldly that if the violations of law by the white man in the slums over the years were calculated and compared with the law-breaking of a few days of riots, the hardened criminal would be the white man.

Acts of hatred are morally obligated in some cases. There is a manner in which you cannot [[love]] anything without accepting the hatred of its opposite under entailment. Divisiveness cannot be escaped in material dialectics.

The notion that we ought to have a society in which change is generated through a functioning democracy is obviously something I agree to,<<ref "i">> but that isn't an option available to our oligarchic society ruled by sociopathic capitalists and their reactionary hordes. [[Justice]] in our society will not arise without violence. Both Saint Marx and early [[Saint MX]] were correct: revolution is the only option. Saint MLK's turn later in life, the direction of this line of reasoning, is why he was assassinated.

I don't see why urban riots are a //distorted// form of social protest; they are simply the next level. In [[Gradual]]ized [[T42T]], you still have to escalate. Violence is sometimes morally obligated, particularly when the disenfranchised have no other way to increase their defection against the bourgeoisie. This is the language of the unheard, and they are merely firing across the bow. It takes balls of steel to stand up to the dogs of capitalism (a likely losing proposition<<ref "l">>). On average, the violent protests are brave, not merely cathartic. There is a pursuit of truth in the deconstruction.

Consistent paramilitarized police violence under qualified immunity against the poor, and especially people with darker skin, is only a fragment of the problem. Even that is a perfectly reasonable ignition point for a riot though. Floyd's Death is not a mere excuse to riot; it's a tipping point, a domino, yet another last straw.

Not all protesters are rioting, and not all rioters are looting, of course. Furthermore, not everyone's participation is well-motivated, but this is true in almost every political grouping I can conceive. Indeed, there are false-flag operations, opportunistic clowns, and psychopathic jokers who just want to watch the world burn without putting their skin in the game to build something better. Note, federal law enforcement and police departments are deploying [[memetic warfare]] tactics to shape the narrative (including physically attacking the press).<<ref "s">> See the difference between what the [[pright]] are allowed to do in public with the open and quiet support of those in [[power]] and the [[pleft]] (to the actual left of the Overton Window). Yes, the [[pright]] revels in this opportunity to cast the poor as a mere mob, and the poorest [[pright]] who desire their alienation gleefully leap into our civil war so that Daddy capitalists can sublate everyone. The riots are not a mere spectacle though, nor are they sufficient. This is an attempt at class consciousness, a chaotic, schizophrenic construction of a collective hand of the poor grasping for a way to signal. Thousands of mixed voices crying out: you better fucking listen. We ought.

"Oh, the ~~humanity~~ property!"

Destruction and looting are but a sliver of justice. Look at the Hohfeldian property rights: the goods were already theirs to begin with, and the buildings served as a monument to their exploitation. When the riots even remotely mimic the theft, violence, exploitation, slavery, and crimes against [[Humanity]] committed by capitalists and their reactionary pyramid, it is in virtue of a demonstration of empathy. It is a kindness; it is a hedged, a holding back! The psychopaths who enable such a system (which consists of most adults I've met) never merited their lives in the first place. 

It is not clear that //looting// is the principal feature, but it is a scarlet thorn for those defending the Rand-Locke memeplex as their core ideology. There are many attacks to consider. One obvious move is to claim "you need to be clear about what you're saying before you claim that you're not being heard." The suppression of education, voter rights, and opportunity serve the interests of the wealthy. It is an Orwellian problem that the poor have purposely been deprived of the tools necessary to have such a voice. Nationalism is also wielded to claim that protests should not occur because it makes us look bad, hypocritical even. Obviously, our nation is a failed democracy through and through; we are that bad. You will be accused of moving the goalpost in the [[pright]]ists eventual faux capitulation; it is a false compromise in virtue of attempting to reframe this exclusively as a racial and law enforcement problem.<<ref "o">> This is yet another rhetorical sleight of hand, abusing the intersectional problem, taking up racism as a cover for the more fundamental centralization of [[power]] in [[neoliberalism]].

It's easy to spot the enlightened centrists, reactionaries, crypto-capitalists, Democrats, and those who have no intention of spending their lives on anyone except themselves during protests that turn violent. The wealthy and those who defend them do not deserve to live. If you think sociopathic apathy and feigned living-beyond the culture wars (oh no, but my mental health is sacrosanct!), convenient helpless fatalistic Daoist camoflauge (just trying to survive in capitalism without putting your skin in the game or recognizing the responsibility emerging from your moral agency), post-left anarchy (let me guess, anything that isn't your egoistic will to power is "disgusting" authoritarianism), or peaceful protest purists (you mean people who might upset the status quo through what are sometimes the only functional means available to them should be silenced) are the answers at this point: you are the problem too.
