!! Write about something you frequently forget.

I forget my answers to this prompt. What do I think about my forgetting the answer to this prompt? Well, I've never been asked this exact prompt before, and this is, in some sense, the first time that I've recognized that I've forgotten the answer to this prompt. That doesn't sound very frequent to me, but I've probably forgotten how many times I've been asked this prompt as well. And, as we all know, knowledge is the result of remembering what we always knew, including the acquisition of new knowledge. That's how I know that I forgot about this unforgettable prompt.

Stay tuned next time I answer this prompt. I swear to all that is holy I won't have the same answer.
