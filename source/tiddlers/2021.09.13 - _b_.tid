That technological progress is so thoroughly motivated, driven, and shaped by capitalism is not an argument in favor of capitalism, it's a crisis in how we choose to construct and wield technology.

Philosophical dialectics are not strictly reducible to dialogical processes in which interlocutors exchange competing views in pursuit of approximating the truth together, but ideal dialectics in [[good]] [[faith]] tend to be. Virtuous realpolitik dialecticians recognize some kinds of ignorance (or appearances of such) are malicious. Hence, we can only courageously attempt to maximize open honesty, plain accessibility, elegance, inquisitive admissions of ignorance, accountable skin in the game, objectivity in representing each position, adaptable cooperative reciprocation in iterated clarification, joy in charitably changing our minds via emancipating ourselves from falsehoods and untenable positions, and pragmatically generating something instead of nothing while simultaneously minimizing unnecessary ambiguity and vagueness, underhanded rhetoric, fear of the unknown, purely deconstructive doubt, mere virtue signaling, assumptions of malevolence, egoistic antagonism, redundancy (:P), and an unwillingness to abandon one's hypothesis in favor of a more comprehensive theory. Ideally, paradoxical claims require their own open section of a dialectic, as we must admit their existence while (often paradoxically) disputing how we should wield them while wielding them. The virtuous agent as philosopher, political animal, citizen of the cosmos, and dialectician requires courage to stand their ground in the face of those who argue for their own benefit rather than the benefit of all (or at least all idealized agents), but said agent does not and ought not necessarily pursue the truth no matter the cost. Ultimately, we must also recognize that our work in uncovering increasingly accurate approximations of the truth can be good enough for our context though never completely finished. Epistemic humility must engender a bold, lifelong exploration of the unknown cosmos outside the cave made immanent in the reconstruction of the city.

There are plenty of clear arguments in favor clarity, but there's not so much written in favor of verbosity. In an age of increasingly robust search methods and automated compression reliant upon having large corpuses, we may see some push back in the other direction.
