Hey h0p3, I'm done with the majority of my tests. 3 more to go but you know what? Fuck it. I don't care.

>I wish you the best of luck in your studies.th You know how highly I think of that hard work. It's always an honor to meet a good, honest student. You show us how it's done, sir. Given that I've more time than usual to respond, I'm going to pore over our correspondence (including the contents of the contextlink below),p mull it around, and, with my skin in the non-mere game, be thinkin' of you, your well-being, and your justifiably robust, eunoiac, purpose-filled, regret-minimized, antihiraethical future selves, sir.

Thanks a lot! Yes, you have written a lot this time. I guess it would take a lot of typing for me too! Haha. But hey, I'm looking forward to it too!

>I know my obsessive, carefully brutal,tp candid, and anti-casual messages (tall towers of text of the non-variety creepy type, no doubt) are still difficult to interpret. They always will be, I'm afraid (even for those who have read every word multiple times). Even native speakers know my schizogibberish is often too painful to read (and, your English is [or will be] probably better than mine). There's always so much at stake in our lives. I've appreciated how, even from the beginning of our relationship, you've endeavored to understand what I have to say (and, you're a skilled empath too). Thank you.oc It's been my privilege.

I don't know what you're talking about. Your English is flawless. You don't speak gibberish. I want to thank you for giving me a chance every single time I have stopped texting you and then started once again. I'm sometimes a big douchebag. No wonder I don't have many people around me, lol.

>I'm sad to see that Session didn't work for us (in multiple respects), and, I hope you'll come to see the value in Tox still. Privacy has been a topic we've both been thinking about for a while now, and you've continued to be willing to change your mind on the matter.ih I've enjoyed that you've had such strong opinions about computing. As a n00b on his journey, I'm always in need of more perspective.

I am ready to try any other means of contacting you. I'm a bigger noob than you are, pal. I hope I can do something about privacy issues. Most of them are unavoidable because I need them. I need Instagram for college. I need YouTube because, come on. Who doesn't use YouTube? The list kind of goes on.

>In an odd way, I consider it a gift to a stranger in the desert, as though you were even closer to me than my own brothers.

Whoa, that means a lot. And for you to say that, it takes even more. I'm really honored to hear this. Kinda feeling like an imposter too in some odd way. Thanks a lot.

>I have nowhere to turn to with these comments and questions besides directly asking you (and, you've likely changed quite a bit since you've said many of these words). I want to know with you who you were, are (including who you could be), and will be, of course. So, here goes:

I would totally love to answer them all.

>My dude, it is nearly the anniversary of our friendship! I know that might be trivial, but, in any case: happy anniversary, homie.

Happy anniversary to you too, dude. We've had a great year.

>Has being ace grown any easier over the year?hs

Yes, it definitely has been a lot easier. Although, I have never met another ace person in real life. It has been alright. It sometimes sucks, but hey, nothing comes easily in life. Everything has a price.

>How has your family brother taken it?

I haven't come out to anyone. Family and brother included. Only 5-6 friends of mine know that I'm ace, that's it.

>Have you found more people who understand you more or at least felt less alone about it over the past year?

Well, I definitely have interacted a lot more people in the past year than in the year before. All thanks to college. I have found a couple of them, but I don't think it's worth starting a friendship with them. I'm kind of scared. But I still feel lonely most of the time. For the past four days, I want to cry for no reason and let all the emotions out. I best I could get is moist eyes when I was going on a Dragon Ball video. Sucks, sometimes. I wish I could.

>Though it is not conceptually the case, empirically and currently, do you think the ace community has a higher-than-average rate of self-absorption or people who are less interested in commitment to relationships?

I haven't observed that. I have tried meeting other asexuals on Reddit. It was nice but I never noticed a person who is more self-observed than a regular person. I doubt the commitment part too. I mean, I'm a guy who is afraid of commitment and thereby, less interested in it. But I doubt that it is the same for all. I have noticed a few peculiarities tho. Most of them have some form of depression or something. I mean, I'm not making up a statistic, but majority of the aces I met had issues with happiness, mental health, anxiety, depression, anhedonia, etc.

>Are they more likely to be intimacyphobic? Are they more likely to lack experience in other social aspects of the human condition? Do they tend to have their "shields" up more consistently than others? Insofar as you can even hazard generalizations, what have you noticed about the kaleidoscope of fellow aces? I simply know far too little.

Most aces love intimacy, but not sex. We all would love to cuddle, hold hands, etc. But sex? Umm... We need time to think of it. I don't believe that they are more likely to lack experience in other social aspects of the human condition. No, they don't have shields up. They're just like everyone else. Like I said, the only peculiarity was the mental health thing. Well, Since I have tried only reddit, it is possible that the actual statistic to be different as reddit is a lot pessimistic.

>How's your physical diary writing going?

I'm making progress. The last time I wrote was February 9th. I wanted to write on Valentine's Day, but I couldn't because I had a test the next day.

>Still considering the possibility of going fully digital? TW is dope for this.

No. I'm not. I don't the trust the internet well enough and I think it could backfire in some weird way.

>Did you ever get your driver's license?ic

Not yet. I have gotten the learner's permit. I just had to pass a written test on road safety for it. It was easy. I still haven't learnt how to drive. I know how to drive, but just not well enough to drive around in Bangalore.

>Does that come in stages for ya?

Yes, a learner's license first and then the driver's license.

>If you had to guess, proportionally, how many people have a license in your city? Similarly, how many people who you personally know have one?

I would say about 30-50% of the adults in the city. Every adult in my family has it, even if they don't drive at all. Most of the people in college are slowly getting it, most of them already have it. The pandemic is definitely affecting it.

>I'm enjoying the fact that I anticipated your future concern about wishing you could study the humanities.
And, ironically, I've enjoyed that I'm the one asking the humanities-based questions instead (which is my job*).

Well, you have seen countless people like me. You have experience. You know me better than I know myself. Yeah, the thing is, no matter how burning those questions are, I don't ask. The day before yesterday, I was in my Engineering Physics class. There were hardly 10 people in it because many had skipped it to study for the tests. The professor taught for a concept for 20 minutes and left us free. He's also the professor who would give out free advice, talk about new awesome space stuff, philosophy, etc. 3 people were talking to him about philosophy. I badly wanted to join in the conversation, but I was shy. I eavesdropped them the entire time. I made a lot of eyecontact with the professor and he realised that I was eavesdropping and badly wanted to say something but didn't have the balls to. I pretended to study for the test. He just went on with the conversation with the other 3 people. I don't ask questions.

>I'm still trying to help you accomplish this task on your own, in your leisure time, even if you don't get a piece of paper for it (and, I would have doubts about anyone selling that paper to you too).

I thank you a lot for it. I really have noticed it. Thanks for trying to fill in that void. I don't care about a degree. These are the stuff I like to do when I'm free, I don't want to make a career out of it. It won't become leisure if I'm doing humanities even during my free time and in my career. I would get tired of the monotony.

>I hope you will continue to question why education curriculum in your country has not allowed it to some dok. It wanes considerably in my nation, and there are parts of it that are banned, heavily discouraged, or even outlawed (depending on the jurisdiction*).

I don't need to question it anymore. They are making changes to the education system. The whole structure will be changed, but the problem is that it will be around 2030 by the time it will be implemented.

>If you are interested in piracy (or need help), the offer stands.

I don't like to participate in piracy as I would be denying the person who made it a fair return for their efforts. But yes, if I would ever need to, you'll be the person on my piracy speed dial.

>Even if you haven't been speaking in-depth with more people, have you been able to find more people to have "this kind of conversation" with?

No, I haven't. I have found a few people, but they aren't this inclined.

>I want to more explicitly disagree with the claim that "trolls don't respond back because they know that if they do, they have everything to lose."
That may be the case sometimes, but I've found plenty of exceptions offline and online.

Well, they are all a step ahead I guess. I haven't met that kind of people in my life yet.

>Do you feel any closer to understanding answers to your questions: ["Why do you type all of this out on the internet? I mean... what's the point?"]?

A bit, but not completely yet. No offense.

>Do you still really believe "There is no point of anything in life...All of this are just stuff to do so that we don't get bored."

Yes, I do believe in that but I have made some modification to it. There is no point in life. All these stuff are there so that we don't get bored. But how did all of these stuff come? Curiosity. Curiosity has revolutionized humans so much that we base our entire lives on it and forget the main purpose of reproducing and dying.

>Depression sucks. /nod.
I don't mean just occasionally feeling that way. I'm concerned with your epistemology more generally here too.

Thanks a lot, mate. I hope that nobody else goes through them.

>Can you think of objectively better reasons to pursue anything beyond boredom?

Right now, like I said before, it's curiosity. Other than that, nope. I haven't given much thought into these.

>Do you still agree to the claim: ["I'm never satisfied. Nothing does. I want everything."]?

Yes. That hole is a bottomless pit! haha

>Do you really still think (and, I'm perhaps putting words into your mouth, so please correct me) this world is basically reducible to a meatgrinder?

Umm... I tried urban dictionary and the whole process but I didn't understand what you meant by the meatgrinder. If you could explain what you meant, I could answer to you.

>In addition to your own health, what other things have you cared about and committed yourself to this past year?

Other than completing TV Shows and distracting myself by watching them, I don't think I have committed myself to anything else. I suck.... 

Yeah. I do...

Okay, I'm getting tired now. I will reply to a huge portion of it tomorrow.

I'm sleepy. I
