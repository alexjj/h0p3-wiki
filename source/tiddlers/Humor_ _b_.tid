"Oh fuck", he says, "my wife is going to absolutely kill me. She’s already upset with how often I drink, and now look. I’ve gone and done it again and thrown up on myself".

"Nah" the bartender replies. "Here’s what you do. Take a $20 bill out of your wallet, out it in your shirt pocket, then tell your wife some other asshole at the bar got so drunk he threw up on you, and gave you $20 to get your shirt cleaned"

"Brilliant!" The old guy reaches into his wallet and puts cash into his shirt pocket. He thinks this plan is so good that he can afford to sit at the bar a bit longer and have a few more beers.

He stays until bar close then stumbles home where he finds his wife waiting for him the second he opens the door. She immediately yells at him, "where the hell have you been!? At the bar again, and you got so drunk that you puked on your shirt!"

"No no no honey," the old man says with slurred words. "Some other jerk got so drunk he puked on my shirt. Look, he gave me twenty dollars to get my shirt cleaned" and he hands her the cash from his pocket.

"Well then why is there $40 here, you idiot?" she asks.

"Oh, well yeah...he shit in my pants too".
