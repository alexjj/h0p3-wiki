1632-1677; Benedict Spinoza

* To understand the world we should apply the methods of mathematics to reality
* If God is infinite, he cannot have boundaries; everything is part of God, all is one.
* The totality of everything is the only thing that needs nothing outside itself in order to exist; it is the only true substance, it is God
* Many imagine God as a ruler, lawgiver, king, merciful, just etc. Whereas these are attributes of human nature, not applicable to the divine nature.
* Religious and scientific conceptions are two ways of describing the same reality.
* Mind and matter are one and the same thing expressed in two ways, though different attributes
* All things are alive and have minds, in different degrees
* As God, or Nature, exists for the sake of no end, it also acts for the sake of no end.
* Concepts like good, evil, confusion, warm, cold, beauty, ugliness do not indicate the nature of anything; they are products of the imagination.
* We di bit desire anything because we judge it to be good; we judge something to be good because we desire it.
* Reason demands that everyone love himself, seek his own advantage and should strive to preserve his own being as far as he can.
* There is no free will; the mind is determined to wish this or that by a cause, which has also be determined by another cause, ad infinitum
* Understanding that we are not free can liberate us, enabling us to come to terms with things as they are.
*  We should look at our lives through the eyes of eternity; our personal problems are insignificant in the totality of things.
* Our desire to understand Nature (God) is the very essence of our minds, and this drive to understand also characterizes the good for us.
* Although virtue is founded in rational self-interest in turn urges us to desire the good of others.
* Freedom of speech is necessary to secure the public order.
* The true aim of government is liberty. by enabling people to develop their minds and bodies in security.
* We are bound to obey laws even when we recognize the to be irrational, since the alternative (living without civil society) will always be worse.)
* The law against killing animals is based on superstition; reason dictates that we consider our own advantage and use them at our pleasure.
