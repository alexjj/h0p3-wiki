title: 2021.10.30 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: monster-20 rises

[[TTTOTW]], //Skintime//, and rabbitholing with [[ASK]]. Time slips by too fast. `/blink` and half an hour passed. I'm glad she wrote; clarification solved the problem for us. What I said did trigger the night terror, =/. I'm glad we have time. I'm excited to see how she does writes. Sounds like she wants to program too after the four of us talked with my daughter yesterday. Sleep by 2:30?

Woke at 10. [[TTTOTW]] + DWG vs T1! The finals shows up in the semis, my ninjas. Saw a couple minutes. 

Folks made breakfast for and with each other. Assignments for the offspring (my daughter is in a better mood than I'd predict given that she's working on schoolwork this morning). [[TTTOTW]]. [[monster]]-20 came in. My god that is a fancy fucking phone. Absurdly snappy. Trying OEM stock a bit, but still thinking LineageOS will be where I go (as my wife's old Samsung Galaxy III, a classic, still functions pretty decently if you're willing to run old and slim apps because it doesn't have some bloated pile of Android not fit for the ancient hardware). Got it up and running, protected, and despite how much I hate my phone, I'm pleased with it.

Shopping @ Aldi with [[ASK]]. A simple shop, primarily for produce. Had a lady staying with us the entire time coincidentally. Said she was my shopping buddy, even tried to hand her a card after some back and forth (rejected, loser!). She did say, "once you go thick, there's nowhere else to put your dick." Hilarious. Picked up stuff I thought [[5c0ut]] might need for his datenight (including, and I "shit" you not, Crisco, which got plenty of laughs), and I picked up goods for everyone. [[ASK]] is burning her soon-to-be-lost EBT largely on an ark of non-perishable comforts for her room per my request. 

//The Date// was chill. My wife has had a migraine for days. We had Aldi sushi, eggrolls, and fizzy dranks. The convertible chalkboard coffeetable is perfect for this. Allowed us to eat and immediately convert to put our feet up. //Raw Skintime//, watched garbage in our exploration (not even mentioning anything I couldn't get an episode through in [[TV: Exploration]]). Fireman Time! //See// the show, many episodes. I really, really wanted to like it. The premise is not boring, religious imagery (to my blind eyes `/wink`), and I like the characters (never enough fucking). The story just doesn't add up though, and too much is forced. Oh, and, apparently, there was a bird flying around in our basement. Lol. I think it is gone (we opened the garage door, and it may have escaped?).

Put mi amor to bed. She needs to sleep. [[j3d1h]], [[ASK]], [[5c0ut]], and I lounged in the commons, eating chocolate, shootin' the shit, with my daughter and I sniping. I ate some noodles too. 

[[TTTOTW]] + LoLWorlds + Dark Chocolate.

[[ASK]]ing. Tiddloid doesn't have perfect behavior (trying to overwrite her TW with a blank one), but we got around that. Resilio Sync and single file mode is clean and fast, just gotta make sure you don't hit race conditions. Tiddloid is gorgeous (huge upgrade, imho), and I like the shortcuts it adds.
