title: 2020.09.07 - Prompted Introspection: Queerly Committed

!! Were you born to shine in one special way? What makes you really stand out?

Shine [[gfwiwcgws]]? Stand out with respect to what? To what extent are shining and standing out mutually exclusive? There are contexts where I shine. There are practices in which it feels as though I am born for them, or at least serendipitously well-suited to them. I often fade into the background, but sometimes I stand out like a sore thumb. What I exist to do and be is not always something I shine in or stand out regarding. This is about inequalities in story-telling, and I aim to be egalitarian (even if I must do so unequally in some respects), [[WINTCIS]]. I [[hope]] to fittingly shine in [[good]] [[faith]] attempts to practice [[The Original Position]], even stripped of my arbitrary characteristics (a [[ROG]], to some [[dok]]): I [[hope]] I pursue wisdom [[irwartfrr]] with [[others]].

Is this about how I perceive that I am perceived, or even how I wish I was perceived? Approval-seeking, including the real and right given performance and gaze, is a very complex moral problem. On the face of it, I think I stand out as a hard-headed madman. I'm an extraordinary idiot to most people who spend even an hour thinking and feeling with me at full blast. I think on most accounts, I'm a mean loser, I'm unforgiving gibberish failing to tell forgiving stories, and I'm generally useless to what most people value (it is a hilarious incoherence in me that I pursue Democracy given my predictions of most adult homo sapiens<<ref "w">>). Yeah, I'm so queerly committed that I should be committed. I can see why vanishingly few take themselves to have significant incentives to speak with me. I've got that o' so awful paranoic scent and retard shine. Unfortunately, there is truth to the ugliness of how I stand out.

I'm a rapidfire deconstructor. I often suss and suck out almost all the [[hope]] in a room. The silence of the vacuum does a lot of metamodern work. I also think it allows real light to shine.
