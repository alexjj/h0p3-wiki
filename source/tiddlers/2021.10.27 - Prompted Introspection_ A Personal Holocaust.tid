!! If you had to eliminate one million people from one ethnicity, which would it be?

Well, of course, it's the god damn (((((((Jews))))))).<<ref "j">> Kek the kikes,<<ref "i">> or whatever. Do Texans, The American French,<<ref "af">> count as an ethnicity? I'm not a huge fan of California or Florida so much either, come to think of it. No, I'm a fairly equal opportunity hater. This is the dumbest fucking question I've had to answer in [[Prompted Introspection]]. Can we just pick the wealthiest million people above the age of 25 on the planet? That's the "ethnicity" I want to cleanse, literally. If I'm not allowed to go this direction, then I'm kinda stuck (I'm hard-pressed to draw lines on what even counts as ethnicity, `/squint`, that looks a like a Dasein to me). Fine. Fuck you, Samwise. Fine. fine. afesdljasdfl;kj. It's an empirical question I don't know the answer to, but I can pick out the function even if I don't know how to resolve it. Here it goes: if I had no choice but to eliminate one million people from one ethnicity (however the hell you want to define that), I would pick either whatever answer maximized global utility or (if it were different) whichever minimized enslavement of current and future generations of persons.<<ref "t">> Perfect non-answer to this useless question. Obviously, again, the function surely picks out the joos with their homosexual agenda.

Evil [[h0p3]] would begin a bidding war.<<ref "es">> Who valued their lives or the deaths of [[others]] the most?

Lulz. Okay. I'm still unsatisfied. I'm still searching for some way out here. Ugh. Perhaps the previous answer I've given could pick out people from the past or future, or maybe aliens. And, moreover, maybe the selection would simply be a million people who were actually going to suffer far more had they not been selected for what I hope would be painless (if not pleasurable) elimination.<<ref "d">> This is my [[hope]]: that those who would be picked out by the function would, from an ideal perspective, prefer their own elimination in this case. I can't say for sure that such a group obtains, but I would feel a fuckton better about it.
