!! Audit:

* The skeleton becomes like a closet, almost olvoldy, and heavily [[/b/]]ed. [[CDR]]s continue to [[/b/]]leed together in general too.
** It [[prompt]]s me.
* It's especially important to me when it comes to [[FTO]]. I have to have a place to think aloud indirectly.
* My general desires and feelings also clump and bleed out into this cheese grater.
** It's extremely emotional up here.
* I am grateful that [[MMacKay]] has let me off the hook for now. I wouldn't even know where to begin. 
** He makes me feel less alone too. That's what I want to tell him. I will wait to say it.
* It reminds me of making tweets to myself. 
* As usual, my [[review]]s do not live up to [[Sphygmus]]'. She sees her wiki differently, and I'd like to understand how to tell the story in this process like hers.
** I don't know why more TWists don't follow what she has there. Not enough users and exposure, probably.
*** It also requires either natural motivation or significant discipline.
* I'm growing extra fond of having the [[title.Title]]s do such a different kind of work. 
** m o o d
* If it doesn't continue to the story, or continue to be meta about the story directly, it's associative. It branches laterally. 
** I want to make this detailed, and I want to become someone who spins it up and off the cuff from sheer force of habit kneejerk instinct.
* It's a place for judgment.
* Oh shit, I totally forgot about the [[Timelines: Philosophers]]. 
** Never enough time. That is project I need to whip out.
* It's been good to meet [[Magnus]]. 
** He strikes me as not only intelligent and sensitive, but exceptionally kind and open. He's a good dude.
* [[Chatlog]] [[review]]s are distributed throughout the month.
** I really liked having more time. I'm going to ease up on myself here. That's been handy-dandy, and the folx enjoy not being bombarded.
** Also, tiddler creation count is up. The [[Review]] is growing more expensive.
* This is the web inside the web.
* I know it sounds weird to say I'm a public intellectual for writing this sort of thing, [[ITS]]. There's something to learn from engaging in the practice that can't be taught otherwise.
