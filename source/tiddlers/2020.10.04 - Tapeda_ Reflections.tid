"""
[pending] : 2020-10-04
[08:44:09] Tapeda: Meta-mathmagically I do think there's an interesting concept of telling the same story with an ever changing lending of the view. I feel as if one could speak of anything in terms of everything, or everything in terms of anything perhaps, to its extent, of resonance, and usefulness at least.
[08:44:32] Tapeda: I would like to start by telling you that grilled cheese, tomato soup, and Avatar: The last Airbender nights seem amazingly great, and much preferred to the escape the show once lended me.
[08:49:50] Tapeda: I think of a lot of media, in many mediums as escapes throughout my time, 
But that's not to say I had it particularly tough, 
yet also not to say I didn't have reasons to need escape. 

I find when looking back at your past it all seems so inevitable , all could not be much different than the me, happening now.

Are you trying to save the world, or heal your wounds? 
or disarming a world which wounded you, and put you on a percieved noble quest, one that no one seems to get, or wish to understand? 
I knew what I wanted, I was stubborn of what I wanted, I was delusional in what I needed. 
Maybe heal the wound, not fix the world. 
Why try to change the world, before changing yourself, you know that changing the world will never be done by the broken man, 
As the pathetic wounded men, broke the world in the first place.

[08:51:37] Tapeda: I'm telling you man you're more powerful than you will ever know, and i would take that as fact, the power lies within, you say you arguably do not have enough commitment in your acting with children(i would probably disagree, you seem a really great father to me), however, i do think you have more to share with them than you let on even to them, as you somewhere deep within perhaps also find that the truth that lies rummaging around your distrust of persons lies a dark secret of where the world has come to, and this truth could destroy what you're children have built in terms of relationships and more, and perhaps even what your wife stands for.. Society today is truly sick, in a visceral psycho-somatic fashion, where gut problems are treated with duct tape and drugs, depression with SSRI's that let us ride as if we were some top-lobster, wish my childhood looked more like grilled cheese and tomato soup, and ATLA with the fam, than ATLA as an escape
[08:52:36] Tapeda: I also do hope I manage not to drive you away from responding entirely with my barbaric babblings, and metaphoric(Meta-euphoric) ramblings.. As in some sense you are one of the few I've ever have to pleasure to encounter with, who's both opinions I respect and Integrities in honesty of character I believe.
[08:54:38] Tapeda: I guess i used to be in more permanent trauma-mode, and have come around the absurdity and fun of post-rationalism, while still maintaining access to analytical science, and rationality(https://twitter.com/Plinz/status/1302695739160551424)
[08:55:40] Tapeda: Why do you try to fix the world with an open wound?
Because you see the world as a threat that is still attacking, and making the wound bigger. 
So it is not to heal the world, but to disarm the threat But once you've healed yourself, you can begin to heal the world by your idiomatic way.
[08:56:33] Tapeda: If i am god in the no-body sense, consider these compliments from the chef, of the fine ingredients I found in your kitchen
[08:57:02] Tapeda: Let's talk of identification(of/within, without self)
[08:58:33] Tapeda: I refuse to surrender to routine, as I find it's the killer of sense-itivity (atleast conditionally, as routine is somewhat neccesary I find)
[08:59:00] Tapeda: Why is it that the friends we've lost stay yet so close us, however distant the days become?
[09:00:29] Tapeda: I craft an image of you in my mind, it is a mirror I am able to reflect upon with my every idea when I so wish. 

Toxic duty, when the rules have changed, but the will has not.

Do we torture, and whip the world into coherence, and compliance out of fear of what we've become?
Has god, the one within you, become afraid of what he has created, the ripples you have caused?
I've written more for you than you will ever see, I've thought more of what I could write then you could ever care, but this mirror I see you in lets me add a few strands to my helical dance in concept space, which I appreciate more than you would ever agree.
[09:08:59] Tapeda: I think the ward, aard, bard, sake , and ache, award for a higher concept space. Perhaps the language of the voice(where poetry started, and is usually used and should reside), is much more powerful than we care to remember, such that poetry was once a moping, only spoken arts for resonant-alignment, much that scribing is mere memetic darts. 
Our old noises of OM, and Ah, mommy, dada, father, mother, Nigh, and dah, big, and dig, dough, dawgg, diggity, by damn. Dogg Godd; or oddly gobblin', doggly barkin, walking, talking, by golly kitin', fighting, biting, sighting, lightning, bloodhounding dreams of years thousands afar, and ahead. 
Just Looking for the orc in force, the function of 'f' and 'e' and how they transform orc to force, the brutal ever relenting never repenting orcs in force. But as one seems to spring off the other and vice versa I seem to have to dance and mingle with my concepts in poetry to even attempt to glimpse at some intricate intricacies, of idiocies of meaning indexed by way of indris'es(never touching ground) between.
[09:10:40] Tapeda: Without hope there is depression 
Without ego there is stagnation 
Without confidence there are masks, 
(the more successful your social mask the lonelier you become inside)
 Without love there are things
[09:11:11] Tapeda: I guess al I am saying is the fact that dog and God are reversals of each-other is not entirely coincidence and that through poetry we may discover, or atleast search for a narrative-why..
[09:12:23] Tapeda: So salience is a question in convenience, how do you find the algorhythm for fidning the salient(lotta info with little digging), for example I think the world could be well described, and principled up by only terms of `A:TLA` however doesn't mean it's for the best
[09:14:30] Tapeda: Because charachters, not letters, characterizations, not classifications build great, grand salience in modeling
[09:17:05] Tapeda: I always prided myself, for being self-aware, or honest with myself, and able to fix of me what could, maybe; should, be in need of adjustment. But there's no dream where you cannot wake to a prior dream from. And myself is a very crappy word, as what do i Identify with? Much more than merely my(self), my(body), I identify with my cultures, principlesm and all.
[09:17:50] Tapeda: I respond to my crafted image of you not out pouting out of naivety to your truer nature, but for me to compete, and to challenge you to be more than you mere, indeed making mare's to race
[09:20:12] Tapeda: Hear me hare, here a mare may just dare, as for me to care, or you so bare, fly-u as he the bee, may be mere guided puppets, in guilded stars.
[09:23:23] Tapeda: so what's my duty? well it rhymes with dead, deed I mean, and no not weed, but for me to lead, and teach.

“It is a fact, indeed, that most of
the great teachers of mankind have been not writers
but speakers. Think of Pythagoras, Christ, Socrates,
the Buddha, and so on. And since I have spoken of
Socrates, I would like to say something about Plato. I
remember Bernard Shaw said that Plato was the dramatist
who invented Socrates” 
-- Borges
[09:25:46] Tapeda: So when new peoples of the orbis populis look for shared meaning yet today, instead of finding religion or some patriotic liking, they look to, and live in imagined futures, and for coporations that live to write and sell them.
[09:29:04] Tapeda: Constructed by trilling towards equilibria, the equator, and defiance in definition of the centraless maze, putting points for fixed rotational symmetry, in never expending mysteries, of ever expanding labyrinthian pathological reasonings.
[09:29:19] Tapeda: I divide to reconstruct
[09:30:41] Tapeda: Push apart to pull back, indivisble defined, restructured, to exact, I being life, for why burn down in heat if not to cool tocrystalize again?
[09:34:21] Tapeda: Only blame for what they do after meeting with you, as the longer you talk with someone the more inevitable every act of theirs seem to become, the opposite of free will, is not determinism, but instead that of impulsive action, the less one orchestrates, and thinks, the more of your past programming lies in your future, But are we then no more than puppets pulled by EMR from the stars, well that's a deeper quandry, yet only remeber determination is skillful art
[09:34:57] Tapeda: remember*
[09:38:26] Tapeda: The snake is the one dancing to the best rhythm of the night that which holds the middle ranch on the tree of life together, and away from the planets of the exteremes, icy giants, arrogant elves, and greedy dwaves(https://www.ancient-code.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/10559961_545146758944245_4763288013922299078_n.jpg)

[09:38:45] Tapeda: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HH-pALd9rEs&ab_channel=JoshNEx
[09:38:54] Tapeda: ^ love these videos by the way fucking hilarious
[09:39:30] Tapeda: and maybe i'm just a less read, more attentive gpt model spewing crap but i enjoy myself
[09:40:07] Tapeda: People get so lost chasing ideals, forget to work on ideas, chaos is really just a measure of how many factors at play
[09:41:38] Tapeda: Never underestimate the man who overestimates himself as he'll do just about anything to prove his dillusion true, or atleast push it off till its end
[09:44:01] Tapeda: If you want information, pretend to be naive, if you want control, pretend to know, and with that connect-i-cut for the day, and why does america the land of liberty not go harder on self-actualization? y'all seem so scured of your potential
[09:49:41] Tapeda: ok ok last, thing i've got A mental fun funded fundamental universal place for verse, vice and more, our dice, come along and dance, become entranced, in broody little old france, the moody romance, with nights averse to the the glance of ever long forever strong dictating dialechtic parlimetary parabola of parler, and Kant's.

Just Fun fundamental traversal's In universes by verses for feats like none other, bor bother, brother.
I leave no bearing that when the hero realizes the fear of the labyrinth's no center, without assumption or axiom from which to circle around as an informal center for the demented-horse runnin around. When you begin to lose the game you begin to play the meta game, as our Meat's Meta hamming distances in the space of all congruent belief systems, I mean come on the answer is clearly right in front so therefore the questions are that in importance, no?
[09:50:59] Tapeda: maybe we can talk about names next
[09:51:05] Tapeda: you're right they're so much fun
[09:54:27] Tapeda: Or maybe how we seem to be one of few in the animal kingdom together with three-eyed ravens capable of reasoning about, and within ourselves, and so many forget to live continiously, with a determined eye, and instead spend oh so much time rummaging around their brains
[10:00:18] Tapeda: “A serious and good philosophical work could be written consisting entirely of jokes.” -- My lord, Wittgenstein
[10:02:18] Tapeda: and my opinion on why identyfying with government lies somewhere with Dunbar's work, and I'm not sure that large a scale of millions work great to hold on to.
[10:08:31] Tapeda: `^^` https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gx4H6ZlV_vE&ab_channel=LexClips
[10:09:35] Tapeda: how do you make people work as beautifully as an ant colony? perhaps the psychoactive spiked wine given to the egyptians that aligned to a very common goal, freeing them of themselves
[12:53:22] Tapeda: oh and most of what i write is in that [[REDACTED]] so don't think i judge for a second, it's quite something
[12:53:49] Tapeda: 😅😂
[13:22:58] Tapeda: kayfabe buisness ideals(or rather narratives of how the future should be, that act as new purpose operating systems) are snatching up the young engineers early now a days... but it's no bad thing as all they really end up doing is saving them from the much perfected more exploiting kayfabe narrative that the WWE hall of fame, Donald Trump sells.
[13:24:17] Tapeda: practice being able to resonate what matter to you with your speech.. it may become important when the world changes quick around you, and someone must step up, in many arenas.
[13:24:26] Tapeda: matters*
[13:34:46] Tapeda: oh and perhaps save the word elite, and stop applying it to those rascal shits, and apply it to those elite.
[13:57:09] Tapeda: now you may encrypt anything you like ofc, if it goes past the line of what you find appropriate (safe?), to have to your name.. i would perhaps personally request encryption of a particular [[REDACTED]] message, as to not regret keeping a line open with you, that I've found quite fun, and found great function in participating, and getting great one liners from.
[14:22:32] h0p3: Sorry, I didn't have autoaccept files on your accounts. They are set now.
[14:38:07] h0p3: I apologize for not speaking fast enough. It's both an honor and a pleasure to speak with you. Your words require digestion. 
[14:51:20] h0p3: I hope you won't stop speaking with me even if I am often frozen. 
[14:52:10] h0p3: The [[REDACTION]] is yours, and please let me know if I need to [[REDACT]] anything else.
[17:15:50] Tapeda: Laptop: oh no no, the files were a mistake, copying text from one-note apparently attaches it as a file, you're good!
[17:30:00] Tapeda: Laptop: Prompted Introspection: Kids these days; I find to be very well written, and on the nose and skin in the game is for sure something many seem to forget often as well!
[17:36:05] Tapeda: Laptop: And if you find anything specific you scratch your head at I'm more than happy to attempt a meta-synopsis of any of my meta-bullcrap, in a more plain, rational english haha!
[19:42:38] Tapeda: Laptop:  ohh and to to save myself from the less than ideal reccomendations of siacrio, and prisoners that awakened something a little unpleasant 
[19:43:10] Tapeda: Laptop: The Dark Crystal: Age of Ressistance is genuinely a great art IMHO
[19:43:26] Tapeda: Laptop: and for music Killer Mike got it figured out
