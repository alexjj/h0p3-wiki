*** Bravo. [[Leet]], obviously. The ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 is well-suited to this, with some steps.
*** Not a fan of your [[intentional choice|https://www.reddit.com/r/Rad_Decentralization/comments/u93b1c/superhighway84_usenetinspired_uncensorable/i5shx9r/]], but you are obviously wildly ahead of most people on your claim about free speech (and what that tool may become once if it becomes more one-click). Can't tell you how pleased I am to see client-side filtering championed here. The workers must own the means of production, including who we choose for our [[salience]] signaling. I hope it will have just enough room to be composable; customizing our feeds is most of the battle.
