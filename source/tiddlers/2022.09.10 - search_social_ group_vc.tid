voice chat sunday
https://www.kotienofarm.org/Project-description.pdf
This man works on a small farm in Kenya. If anyone would be interested in joining a group voice chat with him (tomorrow) Sunday afternoon let me know.

What time tomorrow?

He says they usually have rest time after 2PM (Kenyan time) on Sunday, which would be 11AM UTC. No one else has responded yet so I haven't fixed a time yet. If a time works for you we can try to fix that.

Unfortunately, [[Aether]]'s variance in message delivery time is a problem here. Maybe we can do tox instead or in addition?
