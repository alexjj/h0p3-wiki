I'm always amazed at how much you love your wife. You truly do. You work to make peace with you offspring too. Damaged people. I have been around the block at least once now, and I know you mean it.

I love you, too. <3. I know it's expensive to think about me. `/salute`. I [[hope]] work is going well. I can imagine it's kinda crazy out there (doesn't seem to be slowing down). Yall are going through plenty of transitions, and I have no idea what's going to happen. I'm going to [[say it again|2020.11.15 - R: Hi]]: if you need a place to live, please consider our home.
