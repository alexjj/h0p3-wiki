title: 2020.12.05 - Prompted Introspection: Fix My Anger

!! What about yourself have you been trying to fix for a long time?

Ugh. Samwise. y u du this 2 me? Fine, fine fineinfinefineinfeine. I know, you are just looking out for me, asking the hard questions, and so on. I don't even know where to begin.<<ref "t">> //I'm broken//. I'm trying to put my fragmented life back together toward what matters [[irwartfrr]]. I'm bad at it.<<ref "d">> I want specifics here.

My bitter anger is a big one. I think anger is a crucial emotion, particularly for the accountability we desperately need, but I do not wield mine wisely enough. I've been an angry human since before I can remember. It's not that I have a short fuse<<ref "a">> (no, many people who know me well have argued I have tremendous patience), but the fuse gets shorter and shorter ([[Gradual]]ized, but not [[T42T]] enough) with each violation. Often, eventually I cannot hold a relationship with someone because I see much larger portions of our stories (and they do not [and, I tend to be a reasonable guess as to when they are or are not capable of holding onto memories], and they do not aim to take those stories into account). I [[aim]] for jubilee, to forget more in how I forgive, including myself. It's not that I shouldn't have rage (far from it), but even selfishly it would be useful to let go. 

The truth, particularly about humans, is not a pleasant one. Negative emotions run high for someone who knows enough of the awful truth. I look at the world, and I am required to be angry. One of the hard parts of [[The Golden Rule]] is that I am also obligated, in empathy, to be angry on behalf of [[others]] too. They have a moral right to my mind, my computation, my labor, and my emotions too. I do not own myself as much as the Rand-Locke memeplex would push for me to believe.<<ref "o">> Finding my place in the world given my anger has not been easy.<<ref "u">> I don't predict I will succeed here, but I can make progress.

<<footnotes "d" "I mean, don't get me wrong, it's crazy rare for me to find anyone who I think is really, really good at it (and, the codification problem of particularistic contextualism tends to limit what I can generalize for my own life).">>

<<footnotes "a" "Though anyone with my levels of neurotic anxiety, depression, and absurd sensitivity will often find themselves angry where others do not.">>

<<footnotes "o" "Here I will slice the Zen in half. It's not that I can't let go of my anger at all, but their prescription is immoral. They too merit my anger.">>

<<footnotes "u" "I am a deconstructor; I have to be as an autist in order to develop theories of mind. It's exhausting and horrifying looking into what I believe to be the minds of most others. I'm tired of all the unjustified lying I see. I hate participating in a world with these people. Beyond the surface, it is usually torture, and even the surface reveals that to me often enough. I am anti-social while aiming to not actually be misanthropic.">>
