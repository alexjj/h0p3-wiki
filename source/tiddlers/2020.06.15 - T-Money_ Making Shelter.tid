It's Friday! And this guy got off early! What are you up to?
Jun 12 1:36pm
Fuck yeah, dude
Jun 12 1:36pm
`/high-5`
Jun 12 1:36pm
I'm jumping into school with the kids, hopefully catching up on my work
Jun 12 1:37pm
How about you? Gonna get some chill time in?
Jun 12 1:37pm
Got the house to myself for a few hours.  Maybe play guitar for a bit then go put the damn boat back together. I want that project done. It would be nice to take it out tonight or tomorrow. At minimum get it put back together.
Jun 12 1:39pm
Would be a good time to sell it. Lol.
Jun 12 1:39pm

Hey dude, how'd your weekend go?
Jun 15 5:38pm
Weekend went great. Got my boat back together, spend all of Saturday late afternoon evening on the lake with my girls. Sat around Sunday and did nothing. Lol. How about you?
Jun 15 5:39pm
That is outstanding. I bet they had a good time with you. You guys bring lunch/dinner out on the boat with ya
Jun 15 5:42pm
?
Jun 15 5:42pm
I am glad that you got a day of rest, sir. You work hard.
Jun 15 5:42pm
How's your daughter and wife doing?
Jun 15 5:44pm
I'm glad I fixed the leak in the boat and got it all put back together. I had to remove all flooring, seats, console. Blah. But it's fixed for now.
Jun 15 5:45pm
I seem to be on an upward trend of this manic depressive wave. I hope. The girls are doing well. My wife told me my daughter had such a good time because I was in such a good mood.
Jun 15 5:46pm
I am searching for that balance of learning to let go of seeking others (Co workers and new bosses) approval. And trying to remind myself I am so much more than they have attempted to minimize me to.
Jun 15 5:48pm
You did have a good weekend. Super productive all around too.
Jun 15 5:48pm
How was yall weekend?
Jun 15 5:51pm
My wife was able to walk, so it was excellent. Had a date. Family Time.
Jun 15 5:51pm
I didn't know she has an injury?
Jun 15 5:52pm
Yeah, a cyclist blind-sided her (girl was on her phone) a few weeks back. It's taken some time to recover. She's back though.
Jun 15 5:53pm
Ouch. You probabaly told me and I forgot. I am glad she is healing.
Jun 15 5:54pm
Been thinking about making a little camp out here.
Jun 15 5:54pm
Little backyard camping?
Jun 15 5:54pm
We live in the city, but there's a forest area right next to us that's just deep enough that we could build a scavenged fort in it.
Jun 15 5:54pm
Yeah
Jun 15 5:54pm
[[k0sh3k]] is unhappy with it, vetoed until she is convinced by my justification.
Jun 15 5:55pm
I like it. Could be lots of fun and practice some basic survival skills.
Jun 15 5:55pm
I should work more with my kiddo on this as well. Wish I had. More time to spend with her and teach her.
Jun 15 5:56pm
Yup. Urban survival. I want them to be able to look at the objects they own and say "could I live without this?" Stoic reframing and practice being homeless. Plus, if they ever needed to be fugitives, we'd have places to run and hide.
Jun 15 5:56pm
I am more rural. So I focus on animals, plants, water, fire. But I have never made a shelter with my kiddo. By her age I was making them myself! Lol
