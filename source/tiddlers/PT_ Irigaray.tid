* Only one form of subjectivity exists in Western culture (religion, language, philosophy, psychoanalysis, etc) and it is male.
* Women have historically been seen as "mother" (and "the other") associated with nature, body, irrationality, and unthinking matter.
* Separating mind and body is unethical insofar as it perpetuates the division in culture between man/mind and woman/body.
