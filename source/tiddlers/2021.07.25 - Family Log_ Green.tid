* 1uxb0x
** I'm happy that I refilled the power steering fluid.
*** Yeah, me too!
** Thank you for reminding me to take my umbrella and going to get it when I forgot. You're always willing to help out, and I appreciate that! 
** Thank you for your work on the passports.
** Good job on working on the cars. I admire how you bust out the owner's manual to get it right. 
** You've become practically stoic in your ability to manage your emotions. That's a very difficult thing to do at your age (and, I think by the time your frontal lobes are developed, you will be extremely adept). 
** Your outline of the Image of Christ is well done. I'd like to see a thorough analysis of [[Dune]] on this topic. You've got all the pieces you need (and, there's plenty to find online about the topic too!).
** Your bullet-point notetaking->Digested/Synthesized Paragraph-form Crystallization method is excellent. `/salute`.
** Your work on Mangroves is informative. I learnt some new things. done well.
** Thanks for keeping up on the things I'm interested in (even if they aren't quite your style).
* j3d1h
** I frequently offer good art advice to people.
** Even when you have very few spoons, you can be very knife sometimes.
*** I complimented her on this earlier, but accidentally said knife instead of nice.
** Thank you for working on the vehicles. I admire how you are knee-jerk reactively searching on the web for information you need.
** You are delightfully sarcastic, edgy, ironically anemic, and woke. You have a thorough handshake too.
** I have enjoyed  watching Arrested Development with you.
** It's girly and irrelevant, but I enjoy clothes shopping with you. :) You have good taste in clothes which you obviously got from me because you couldn't have gotten it from your dad. 
* k0sh3k
** I love hearing your jokes, the past week I have had a lot of laughter because of you. it helped me get through the week.
** Thank you for pushing my laundry through, it was kind of you.
** Thank you for being so supportive of us traveling without you. That's going to be one weird fucking week. 
** I moved and set up the self-check kiosk all by myself! 
** You make very good points about most stories without spoiling or giving away anything.
* h0p3
** Thank you for driving us around all over the place yesterday. 
** I am glad you look for opportunities to teach the kids important life skills, like adding power steering fluid to the car. 
** Thank you for going out to get us beverages when we go on walks.
** I have not given up. <3.
*** I appreciate how methodical I can be.
** Thank you for going shopping for food. Getting new clothes for 1uxb0x..
** You helped me form some pretty important (if very strong) opinions.
* 5c0ut
** I've had fun hanging out with you while we watch shows. I'm glad you've had the energy to come join us this week! 
** Thank you for gettin' treats for the youth. I know they appreciate a good soda.
*** ^
** Your wiki has been enriched this week. It's a treat for us. We get the scuttlebutt too.
** Your food was amazing. You've got the talent of just picking ingredients out and spinning up something crazy delicious. Country-style Asian Fusion food is dope.
** Thank you for pushing my laundry through,  it was kind of you.
** My flat icing is getting better.
** You're very good about noticing bad moods, and still respecting privacy about them.
