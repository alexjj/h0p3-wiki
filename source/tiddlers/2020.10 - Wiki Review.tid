!! Audit:

* Getting back to [[Antipleonasm Analysis]] was wishful thinking.
* I am reckoning with the fact that my work that I've poured into my offspring doesn't matter so much when they don't care about doing their work. I'm still trying to find a place with them.
** I don't really have anyone to speak with about the matter. None of the homeschooling parents I've met have a terribly high standard of being a good person. 
** It is a source of depression and anxiety, no doubt. I hate that I can't step in and just make it right. =/.
* Thank goddess for mouseover. I need it for lots of inferences now.
* Everyone dropped [[TDL]], and it was okay (minus my offspring's lack of work).
** Trying to shake some things up in [[CDR]]s has been fruitful.
* I'm still not sold on letting go of [[Monthly Audit]]s yet. Even if I did, I'm still going to group them up for the Vaults of each [[Directory]]. Being able to easily navigate by mouse the major streams makes sense.
* There's an embrace of my schizo characteristics in here. Good.
* I can see my curling up in here cleaning. I'm going to continue to do so. 
** I still have [[Letters]] to finish off. I think it's time to slow down for a while. I'll still [[FTO: Ping]] and argue on forums, but I think I need a break. 
*** I also think [[FTO]] has not been nearly as successful as I'd have [[hope]]d. Maybe I should take the hint.
** I am coming to agree that I've met the conditions of my primary work. The shape is here. The opportunity for it to do whatever it could has come, and I don't need to push it. It is now gravy.
*** [[The Remodeling]] and [[Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση]] sound like a quiet long-term project. I [[hope]] that's where I go. I aint superman, and I'm still being ambitious in this [[ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱]] no matter what. Good enough will perfect.
* She's not going to do //Nude Night// with me, but she has increased //Skintime// tremendously. That's more than fair. 
* [[Review]]s seem to have stepped up with [[CTS]]. Maybe there is a bootstrapping.
* New tiddlers are just {[[Dreams]]}, lol.
* This place feels more like meditation. Get it out so I can fall asleep.
* Distinct decline in number of tiddlers made per day.
** I could use some coasting too. I have pushed and pushed and pushed. Curling up into the darkness does not seem unreasonable.
* A sense of lostness has crystallized. It repeats.
* One odd difference now that I VC with [[Sphygmus]] is that I have a lot less to say in between the lines. 
** I am surprisingly dependent on how she shapes her wiki. I like it.
* I have done what I can to demonstrate to my offspring the rhythm of thinking about who we are. They can take it or leave it. It's //a// method. I can scarcely adulting myself.
