!! How do you act when you are afraid?

It depends on the context. How convinced am I of the threat? How convinced am I that I can and should do anything about the threat? A lot of what I'm afraid of isn't strongly up to me. A lot of what I'm afraid of appears overdetermined or uncertain in such a way that I struggle to trace out a fitting approach to even unravel how to find a fitting answer. I think I'm largely like any other animal on this front. 

Currently, I'm in curl-up mode. That is often a fear response for me. I nurture the [[hope]] I can.
