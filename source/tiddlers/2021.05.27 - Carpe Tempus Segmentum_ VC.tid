title: 2021.05.27 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: VC

Saw broski for a bit. He's alright. Picked up a standing and swatting bug zapper; having the windows open has a cost we must pay. [[TTTOTW]].

My USB fan is loud even after lubrication, but it gets the job done. Box fan set up too (broksi as well). So far, no one thinks we need to get window units, but we'll see when summer hits in full. It's at least 80 in the house.

Someone was still on her phone late into the night. Gonna keep ramping the punishment up. =/. 

Leftovers, //Serial Experiments Lain// started (but couldn't, :P), [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! Sleep by 4:30?

Woke at noonish, Meditation, Fireman Time! Cleaning. [[TTTOTW]]. Did yardwork, still killing that plant, and unfortunately, the yaupon that was late (and was already getting replaced) might be dead. We aren't having luck with it. Trees seem good, and surprisingly a bunch of cantelope plants spawned. 

Prepped for dinner, cleaning, gussied up my wife's room with my offspring. The 4 amigos sat at the table (my brother is smelling burning rubber, might be the road, but might be something else). His work options are looking reasonable (I'm hoping he can negotiate for much higher pay). My daughter and I fixed some food and played a match. -0, -1, -0 of gobbos vs clampfinity. I barely controlled G1, and she basically curbstomped me the other two by doing #justaffinitythings. 

Been playing phone tag with the autoshop. They left the key for me, but we were able to arrive before closing. He came out to speak with me (remembers my good manners, clearly). Talked about the balljoint that's rotting (yeah, I hear, but I'm not dropping 1.5k on that): he gave me the same advice that my other mechanics have (good). Interestingly, some of his buddies want to buy the vehicle (or, this is yet another sales tactic; and, yes, he's slick). Told him he has my number, and they are free to make offers.

Shower (because she can smell it on me :P). Inform the Men! Gifted again, but we were both profoundly interrupted by pesky neighborhood kids. Frustrations. `/sigh`. Tomorrow.<<ref "i">> I still had a blast though. It was what I needed.

Talked with [[DeathOfRobinhood]] today; he HMU, we caught up some, still in [[Reply Mode]]. One month until she comes! Both names are gorgeous. They are getting in as much dating as they can while they can, a good idea. They are in solid shape for the future. Thinking with his mom about how to take care of her, having an "our" house. Had to emergency recover files from dead drives, suggesting redundancy, backup, and offsite. I'm gonna be an offsite for him, and, eventually, I may pick up more drive space (it's something I should do for more folks). Thought about our [[project]]s. I was in a good mood (in addition to my elevated disposition lately), and he could tell (reads me like a book in voice). Fairy tales, epics, possibly going off on his own, finishing his 26-short show (his work baby has come to fruition). Church and Prayer Service are going well. There's a young schizo (much like myself) he's helping stay out of trouble, two steps forward one back; my [[Root User]] knows what matters (even if he would deny it). He's kicking ass. I'm always [[grateful]] that my big brother thinks about vocation with me. [[DrDeezee]], [[SSTLabs]], [[Variety Creepy]], argumentation, sophistry, and mimesis; my minimalist [[hope]] as a teacher. We [[share]] many expectations and predictions in common. He has asked me to consider building credibility with capitalists and Libertarians to build tools to defeat capitalism. I have no idea where I'll end up, of course.

[[Family Gathering]], my offspring made stirfry for dinner (it's been far too long since we've had rice, and it hit the spot). We chilled. My daughter seemed more upbeat today (and her razor tongue slicing and dicing everyone today). She's had something like 20 people contact her about the vehicle, and she's not trying to maximize profit at all. She's taking it slow, trying to be fair to the queue. Son and I played -0 gobbos vs clampfinity for the shiggles. My hand was strong, double tuktuk, lots of control, vial, and lackey connect; I powered through 3 MoEs with cheatyfaced development, unanswered pressure, and CA giving unlimited gas. Nothing he could do, imho.

Sat in VC for Senpai [[chameleon]] again. We were able to talk, and it was good to hear her voice (and [[Magnus]]' too!). It's been a while. She's in good spirits, and I'm feeling confident about her future. She is safe, family is doing well, shots set, and that makes me happy. Talked computing shop (I'm always learning something from her), considering social media options + browser tab management + link curators, she didn't get to keep that beast of a laptop `/tears`, she's still on the hunt (might leverage her current offer), making lots of art (maymaying hard too), thinking about the minimum they need to survive, showing me her setup that's evolving, gifts for her father, thinking about Kona ML, and she worked on her game in C.

[[Indy_Nomad|https://www.reddit.com/user/Indy_Nomad]] has [[deleted|https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/nm0fb8/to_those_who_did_everything_your_parents_told_you/]] their post after response. In case you see this, I'm still down to talk, friend. `/wave`. As usual, few have read my ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±. If you see this: I love you. You keep on doing whatcha gotta do. 

It was a good day. 6 people told me they loved me today.
