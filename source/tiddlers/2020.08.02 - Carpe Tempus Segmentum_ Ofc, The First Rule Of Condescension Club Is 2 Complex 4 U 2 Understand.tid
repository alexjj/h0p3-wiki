* Checked on my love
* [[Morning Routine]]
* [[Family Time]] @ 3
* 1-on-1s
** We took our time. I'm glad we get a sense of our week this way too. It's not like the wiki still.
* [[TTP]]s
** My wife was more pleased than she anticipated, and she makes the call on devices here.
** We are preparing to end the summer in a week. `/fingers-crossed`
** I limited myself as much as I could. I'm glad. 
*** Only one tense moment, and it passed easily enough.
* Discussion Notes
** King George
** Discord RP, Omegle, GPT-3, Panopticon
** Generating space with others
** Tab-OCR
** Self-aware wolves
** Botting for targets
** Asking leading questions until they fall to their deaths
** We didn't speak too much, so this went by fast.
*** I asked if I was even high or if I was too high. Felt different to my offspring.
* Reading Our Wikis
** [[Link Log]] continues to be a huge hit. Dope.

*** However, in addition to [[2020.07.29 - h0p3ful Review: Nevertroll]], it spawned [[???]].
** It was super fast. EZ mode. We all plowed through it, still took breaks, shot the shit.
* Dinner
** Rice, veggies, chicken, piri piri
** //Dominion//, I'm being banned out of the game. =). I still took it down.
