title: 2020.09.25 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Almost Every Time She's Bad, I Think She's Either Silly Or Sexy

* Woke at 11:30
** I'm lucky to be able to sleep. Hit the spot.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Walk With Offspring
** Deep rabbitholes again. One of my favorite parts of speaking with my offspring is they anticipate the problems that arise in tangenting so much and work to ground the conversation and back the trains up. 
*** My memory is wildly flawed here. I would know the conversation were it summarized or repeated, but I don't have the ability to recall it. That ability has faded away too quickly, and I'm getting old (and my brain twisted). 
** A discussion of text and film. I am, like, the worst. XD. She's gonna be alright.
** They failed to deliver the goods, again. Surprise! 
*** Pretty concerned my son is not pushing to meet his teacher's expectations in this sphere either. 
** Continue to exhort risk-taking.
** It's been kickass.
* Read+Write
* Coffee.
* [[DeathOfRobinhood]] Call
** Olympic stadium, the view, the sweetspot
** J, the OCD/Anxious/Depressive from a shitty childhood, no support network. Being his friend, building him up, just trying to find any way to help him (almost agnostic to creed [though clearly he is not agnostic at all!], and profoundly concerned with practical consequence).
*** The Exorcism Debacle. J was high. A [[cult]]ic exorcist, another friend's mistake. Error-corrections in the world.
*** He likes J because J aims to be honest and thoughtful.
*** I only get to see a sliver of him. I admire the way this man sows and sews with every fiber of his being.<<ref "s">>  
**** He builds community. His dogma is [[love]], and works hard to be open everywhere else. He's a quiet pillar. He sacrifices his ego and then some for humble hedging; it is obvious in every move he makes. Living virtuous sensibilities. The man is blindingly moral to me.  
** Code Orange
** Selah is doing well, tired. Wrestling. 
*** She's asked J to stay. I am so happy to see their sympatico.
**** Tacit knowledge and agreement in marriage, raw shared sensibilities helps. 
** Vancouver call about politics.
** CBD. Parents-in-law are holding up, recovering. Lack of sport is painful. 
*** Though he knows far more than I could ever, it seems like a place to bond, even if only to know one's wife inside and out.
** [[k0sh3k]]'s feelings, doings, home services.
*** Was partially surprised to hear he has read her RCL/AFF work. I shouldn't've been. 
*** I hate walking into churches (quick trip to rage-psychosisville), especially because I don't feel like even at least almost none of us (including me) belong in the holiest of holies (even though I'll agree there is something divine inherent to each of us).  
** Eastern Orthodoxy and Calvinism
*** Thought about the paper.
*** Asked me if it was okay to ask for others to respond to the wiki. Perhaps there will be an influx of Eastern Orthodox folks who will correct me. 
** Toward Combat, MMA. 
*** LoL dual mapping, Ender's Game formations, building society together
** Nominalism and Calvinism
*** Seems wild to me. But, TULIP is madhat to an Arminian interpreter like me. Trying to charitably make it coherent sometimes reminds me of Spinoza. I will be branded a heretic by some, but I don't see Spinoza as a nominalist either (though I think conceptualism merits serious consideration). 
*** I see no reason to grant the nominalist ground. Yet another underhanded attempt to destroy metaphysics (perhaps even almost equivalent to reductionism or naturalism at the end of the day). I agree that immanence implies Transcendence (with a muhfuckin' capital T!). They can't have their cake and eat it too. We're gonna have to be able to talk about that which can never be fully expressed by us into [[infinigress]], and PoSR arrives at a necessary contradiction too. The empiricist's favorite razor is only a rule-of-thumb; a lot of rules break when we try to talk about [[The Absolute]]. At some point, the strict empiricist should stop talking if they are being honest about the justification underlying their words. They may not help themselves to the essence of the beginning and the end without accepting that they are attempting to map their words onto a universal territory outside of physics. 
**** They are lost wandering the desert struggling to not require f-ness. I'm not going to take up Kant's supposed skepticism here (and, he wrote all the time about the thing he said we must shut our mouths about too).
** Sensibilities as primary guide (or so it feels).
* Vapeylyfe
* //Skintime//
** Snappy.
** She has such interesting discussions with researchers (I never got nearly the same kind of help from our librarians). One looking for arguments against [[Gratitude]] toward a Christian God. She gave excellent advice from my perspective (I get in trouble when I speak to most Christians about this topic).
* //The Walk//
** Dark. 
** Thinking about dementia. Two people losing their minds together.
** Thinking about Calvin. She comes from AoG.
