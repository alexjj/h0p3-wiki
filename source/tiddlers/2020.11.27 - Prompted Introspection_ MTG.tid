!! What is your favorite game to play?

This is a common question. [[2020.05.31 - Prompted Introspection: Disco Elysium]] was my last answer to it. I still don't know what isn't a [[game]] of a sort. Lately, one of my favorite standard games to play has been [[MTG]]. [[Family Gathering]]s have been enriched by this practice. I [[like]] having something interesting and less serious that's still useful. I think we still have to work on having other kinds of activities during meals beyond [[Debatable]] and some card games. It's tricky talking about their days when they have failed to do their best (and while I still have significant responsibility for their behavior). [[MTG]] is a lighter bridge and a teaching tool. I will take what I can get with them.
