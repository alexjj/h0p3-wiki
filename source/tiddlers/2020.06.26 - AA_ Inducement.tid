How has your week been?
Jun 26 10:16pm
How's the kitchen?
Jun 26 10:16pm
Good but tired
Jun 26 10:17pm
You able to get enough sleep?
Jun 26 10:17pm
Got the new braces up just need to drywall...but may have [[JRE]] run the wires first
Jun 26 10:17pm
I just drove to Evansville and back to check on that little girl that is pregnantâ€”she is going to be induced on the 6th
Jun 26 10:18pm
So far all my school assignments have come back good ðŸ˜Š. Howâ€™s ur week?

Jun 26 10:20pm
I measure and cut and [[UJ]] puts them up
Jun 26 10:21pm
Dope.
Jun 26 10:22pm
It's looking really good.
Jun 26 10:22pm
Is she doing alright, btw?
Jun 26 10:22pm
Is inducement a bad sign here?
Jun 26 10:23pm
I think we may try some LED recessed lights
Jun 26 10:23pm
No sheâ€™s a little swollen and has had some contractions but they are trying to give the baby more time to developâ€”the worst part would be that she is married to an asshole (Jordan Claggett) but served him papers this week â€”he stresses her out
Jun 26 10:24pm
Must be an absolute whirlwind for her.
Jun 26 10:25pm
Yeah
Jun 26 10:25pm
How much more time does the baby need?
Jun 26 10:25pm
(not that we can do anything about it)
Jun 26 10:25pm
At least he canâ€™t come to the hospital and bring his drama...only one person allowed
Jun 26 10:26pm
Good.
Jun 26 10:26pm
Not much just a week I guess
Jun 26 10:26pm
k
Jun 26 10:26pm
She has to list the person she wants ...with covid no one else is allowed
Jun 26 10:26pm
I hadn't even thought that far. Having a baby is already insane. Trying to work through the medical system right now is absurd.
Jun 26 10:27pm
It is but right now it works in her favor ðŸ˜Š
Jun 26 10:28pm
`/high5`
Jun 26 10:28pm
Its good
Jun 26 10:29pm
Think I may work on kitchen walls while we wait on the ceiling ðŸ˜Š
Jun 26 10:30pm
Thinking about putting some of the vinyl flooring as a backsplash
Jun 26 10:30pm
Easy to clean...
Jun 26 10:30pm
That makes good sense to me. I can never keep my painted walls clean in the kitchen. I've given up trying.
Jun 26 10:31pm
Yeah and I havenâ€™t tried tile.... for
Jun 26 10:31pm
For slipped in...
Jun 26 10:32pm
I think this will work â€”I can brad nail it up
Jun 26 10:32pm
And its easy to cut
