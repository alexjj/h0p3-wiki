title: 2020.10.09 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Snakehandling

You know, maybe my brain knows that I'm happier when I can't think straight, at least for now. Like, maybe it's purposely making it so that I'm so tired that I'm too dumb to recognize the world and instead simply enjoy chillaxing. Ignorance is bliss. I know this. With enough sleep deprivation and alcohol, I will make myself happy. I'm pretty sure that's how it works. HPPD is in overdrive. It's all good man. It's Saul Goodman! 

* I saw [[Sphygmus]] playing, but I was busy writing to others. However, she was there even after her game. I was lucky to catch her.
** I'm going try to write minimally about our voice conversations. 
**# She's [[naked]]ly prolific in her [[PSM]]ing. 
**# I think it's cool to have another exceptionally rare person in my life where I don't feel the need to record it all (though, I'm happy to hear her immaculate recollections, ofc).
**# I think it's fun to write exclusively and only the truth about my friend. 
** She's a snakehandler who drinks venom instead of water (like any decent snake-handler) and casts serpents on cyclists who have the audacity to use her bike trail. Apparently, it's a fun hobby and a great way to blow off steam.
*** Beware cycling through her forests is what I'm saying. 
*** Camera angles have been on the brain. 
* Read+Write

** So little sleep, amplification with two so young. Rebecca gettin' rekt too.
** Dinner party with webdev in seminary. Awkward.
** Breaking Bad scene, mugging in the 21st century requiring kidnapping.

!! [[Wiki Audit]]:

High-level work today. Fuck yeah.

* [[Root]] has a tag. I've long thought it [[awe]]some that it didn't have one. It's clearly part of understanding what I'm doing here, and it cannot be bypassed without losing something crucial.
** Bye subtitle.
* [[Lifetime Projects]] saw some reorganization.
* [[adok]] is finally getting the boot to {[[Vault]]}. `/salute`. 
** As always, I clearly have no fucking clue what I'm doing. Thank you, sir.
* [[FTO]]-wise, I think I'll leave some links alone. It is interesting to see how few people stay with TW in the end. CAldritch still does some. Cool to see [[Eli]]'s blog is back. I'm sad to see [[kicks]]' forum is down. 
* [[Root Users]] is getting a minor makeover. It may never see much direct action, but we'll see. It is now an {[[Axiom]]}, an exceptionally rare event in my [[‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±]].
* [[TTP]] cleanup.

!! [[Computer Musings]]:

* Cleaning up the new-storage drive, archiving, and checking the health of the mechanicals.
** m10's kodi has not been playing nice over sshfs. It could be how my daughter has set it up, but I also feel like m16 is partly to blame.
*** Gonna try sshfs a bit more. Usually don't have a problem.
* qBittorrent seems to be enough. Some stuff will be done by hand, that's okay. I'm just going to keep it that way. 
* Found out what happened to MyAnon invites. Will be able to send one to [[dziggetai]] soon enough (though there is an interview process, IIRC).
* Subl cleanup
