!! Audit:

* I'm not the only one starting [[Family Time]] now, and it helps in a number of ways.
** [[Family Time]] has been more pleasant too.
* Device restrictions have not been as complete as we thought we were going, but they seem to have helped. 
** They sleep, and they do their schoolwork in the morning.
* I've still not solved my FF problem. `/sigh`. The convenience of having literal fucktons of RAM. Lazy.
* Lots of homekeeping
* I've not done a good job on shopping and the wiki.
** Buried in the world or trying to escape it.
* You are still hunting, perhaps in vain, ways to make your offspring's afternoons long-term snowbally productive.
** I feel like you are succeeding at 20% of it.
** Your schoolwork is out the window entirely at this point, as is the wiki. Not mine to regret. I have to stop empathizing here.  External motivation never disappears, but it will have to be limited (drives me crazy). They have the tooling they need; they will choose not to do it with my open and provable disapproval. You gotta let them fuck up their own lives here.
*** We're over a lot of the major hurdles. They could eat some fuckups here, I think (reasonable enough risk). I think they will be able to survive and even choose complete independence in a pinch (though, as they know, I consider that imprudent until they are mid-20's at the least).
* Never did craft jackshit. `/shake`. You person, you.
* You didn't need Costco as much as you thought. That's part of what you learned.
** Been a while since you lived on $30 a person per week for food. Almost a traitor at this point.
* You've been glue and planner for family and friends here. 70%.
** Doesn't show up here nicely, but I see some of it.
*** Weekly [[TDL]]s and [[Family Time]] [[TTP]] thinking too.
* Jokes, homie. That's exactly what this log needs more of...the intentional sort, not whatever the hell you call this practice.
* Your attempts at reading serious books have failed. Congratz. You will be illiterate forever.
** I'm disappointed in myself. It's not like I haven't been reading (lawd), but my diet is so imbalanced.
* Hard to not do the shit on your list. You make it so easy on yourself. Too easy.
** Fine for a depressed dad. The house is functioning, people make progress, 2020 has been a heavy year.
