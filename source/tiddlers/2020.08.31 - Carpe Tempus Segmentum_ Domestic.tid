title: 2020.08.31 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Domestic

* Woke at 7
** That woman is loud. lol.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Read+Write+Watch
* Offspring did their schoolwork in their rooms. 
** I am doing my best not to get my [[hope]]s up too high, but I'm feeling like it might be working. `/anakin-podracer-meme`
* Talked. Trying to convinced them to go for the full [[Fitness Routine]] now. Lots of eyerolls and smiling I hate yous from my daughter. =D. 
* Fireman Time!
* Read+Write+Walk+Talk
* Deep cleaning and organization in the kitchen. 
** We have a spice rack (looks more like a terrace). Fancy.
** Working on making sure [[k0sh3k]]'s mornings flow beautifully. 
* Shopping!
** Meat prices are higher again, and while the stock isn't in full, it's nearly full.
*** However, overall the prices weren't higher in general. 
** Offspring have never really had much opportunity to ask for anything, and it's a privilege to be in the store with them and ask "what do you want?" 
** Shopping goes quickly with them now. 
** Busy people, a crazy old man, anxieties seemed lower overall.
** Cashier was willing to speak with me. She's from another store (I've never seen her before). Curious. 
*** She started coughing, and had to tell me it was something caught in her throat. Reminds me of Thailand where a nosebleed was sometimes taken to be a huge fucking deal. It scared people. 
* We arrived at the exact same time as [[k0sh3k]]
* Inform the Men!
* Meditation
* Shower
* Cooking
* Read+Write
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Ribs, wedges, kiwi, salad
* Cleaning
* My daughter is embarrassed about her most alpha story of all time. `/sigh`. 
** My wife remembers all the other stories and snippets so much better. I wish I kept a record at all. =/. 
*** e.g. When she was 4 or 5, we were eating ribs, and she grinned and asked if they were human ribs while tearing into them. That kind of shit is hilarious (makes for a cute joke while we were eating ribs today), and it doesn't stick with me well enough.
** Welp. Give her space.
