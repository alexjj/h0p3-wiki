title: 2020.05.15 - Wiki Review: Bare Minimum

* [[2020.05.14 - Prompted Introspection: Ugh. Yup.]]
** Completed. I am grateful that I don't have to do [[Antipleonasm Analysis]]. I just don't have the energy for it.
* [[2020.05.14 - Wiki Review: Push]]
** I wonder what he's going to think. I assume that he'll believe I've gone off the deep end. Lol. Of course. It's true. I'm a madman now. Period.
*** Why would an academic stoop so low as to writing a garbage wiki like mine? Lol! Don't I want to write things other academics applaud? Sure. The reaching out to normies, to people who I don't benefit from, to crazies, to randos in general...that does seem insane. GOOD!
*** I don't want to be hinderance to the man's journey through academia. He's working in an area too few do. I know he's got a lot of integrity, he's been someone who is humble enough to transform himself. He's still himself even though he looks so little like who he was. 
**** Oh, there was a visiting professor who attended Sensen's lectures on human dignity that maybe he should hook up with.

** I would like to be someone who engages in short ephemeral messaging more (in honor of my pseudangel too, ofc). At the very least, automating intros. Shotgun. Meh. Maybe something to experiment about. Surely, there is a science to it.
*** Even minimal connections with 10 randos a day might produce something useful for any of us 2% of the time. Is that too low?

** That was the point though, right? You were supposed to have some days of doing nothing. You even told yourself to do it. Don't be disappointed. Loser. =)
