title: 2022.04.28 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Altered Carbon

Woke at 8:30. Rumination. Meditation. //Skintime// with my sympaticon, planning, [[Morning Routine]]. Tea + fruit + [[TTTOTW]]. og_m4's comments poofed, and not the only accounts disappearing. Fascinating creature. Wonder how much [[Variety Creepy]] would get along with them (I bet they are 3 hops away from each other). 

[[D2]] + [[TTTOTW]]. Sugar is 75 and Matriarch, rushed. Two sorcs chaotically kiting. 

Shopping @ Home Depot with [[1uxb0x]], [[j3d1h]], and [[ASK]]. Picked up paint stripper for my son to work on the door hardware (found out too late that previous renters had painted it, and we'll have to careful removing it), a metallic spraypaint for my daughter to do the trim, and a rubber spray sealant for the valve (which seems to drip once a minute). 

Assignments. Applied the sealant to the valve. Gonna give it two coats. 

Prep for dinner. Lots of cheese grated. We may never poop again.

[[Fitness Routine]] + ibuprofen + CBD. My shoulder has been hurting for days. Can't shake the knot.

The four of us watched //Margin Call//. Good questions. Lots of heckling. We don't give a shit about the characters and don't trust the storytelling much. [[TTTOTW]].

[[5c0ut]] came down to talk. HR meeting as he was witness to some profound discrimination. Emily C. reconnected with him. She's getting divorced (mi amor had deduced). He's been thinking about the times people have said he uses others.

[[Family Gathering]] was great. Chatted for a bit before everyone settled in. Homemade mac'n'cheese, salad, and even some drumsticks. Water. The training Cuddy's Daughter episode of //House//.

Put mi amor to bed. [[D2]]. Tried to rush a nec for my sympaticon (twinked out of the gates, though not to the gills). Ran into lots of bugs though. 

//Skintime// with my sympaticon + //Altered Carbon//. [[TTTOTW]]. Massage. //Altered Carbon//. Tried sleeping by 11ish? Couldn't. Watched more while trying to sleep.
