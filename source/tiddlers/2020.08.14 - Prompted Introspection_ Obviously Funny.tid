title: 2020.08.14 - Prompted Introspection: Obviously Funny

!! What can you do that makes people laugh?

This question reminds me of how [[JRE]] sometimes thinks about himself. He's helped me look at this problem too. Self-deprecation<<ref "s">> and puns tend to be safe, disarming, and cute; I'd like to aim for those. My [[humor]] is often disgusting or requires having taken up a position that is too painful for my interlocutor (it's not taken to be a benign violation). There are people who think I am funny, but I can't say I'm terribly effective at predicting what they'll find funny. Alright, I know what I can do to make people laugh: I can tell people a joke that they'll find funny or act a fool in a way that humors their sensibilities. ᕙ(^▿^-ᕙ)
