* Excellent conversations with my offspring. Huge rabbitholes. 
* //Foundation//, //Arrested Development//, and //The Dark Crystal//
* We shopped hard this week.
* I was [[anonymous]]ly identified in the wild from two fairly plain sentences. The prophecy :P.
* Lots of coincidences this week, including meeting [[Shah]] out of nowhere and advising Emy on a computer to buy and then having to buy exactly that the next day.
* I have decided that 26 meetings is too many meetings for one week. 
* I enjoyed playing the beta of a game. The name of the game was Peglin.
* I seem to be getting overwhelmed more easily. No idea why.

** I'm happy with my work on fixing the accident.
*** Thank you for cleaning that up! 
** Thank you for working on the [[music]] metadata [[project]].
** You've got a knack for history and geography, as your Punic wars discussion demonstrated. That domain is a lifelong study worth your time.
** Your mole chicken tacos were insanely good. We had nothing left of that meal.
** I appreciate how gracious you are to people - like at church, when you let the guy cut in front of you for communion even though he was coming the wrong way. You are very kind. 
** You're becoming one of the people I regularly come to with questions.
* j3d1h
** I'm happy with my decision to try being less snarky.
*** Only a little bit, though. Gives the sarcasm more bite.
** Your scripting was cool, and I'm glad you feel like a mad scientist.
** I'm glad you've tried to connect me and Butter~~(s)~~ together. Thank you.
*** Bitte, loser. :)
**** :P
** I've enjoyed talking with you about your schoolwork and projects this week.
** You're doing the lawd's work in helping your friends with their practical computer literacy.
** I enjoyed talking with you about and develpoing characters, along with bugging you about the logic about it.
*** I swear, she can kill an armed guard, if you follow the Rule of Cool.
** I've enjoyed talking stories with you this week. 
* k0sh3k
** I had a crazy busy week, but I got it all done without letting it bleed over past work time. 
** I adore that you whimsically talk dirty to people all the time. 
** This is the second weekend you've connected with people that matter to you through videochat. It's excellent (even if it's not my cup of tea at all). I hope you keep doing it.
** You've made our weekends amazing (including hunting for presentations for us to watch together). Thank you.
** You're doing an excellent job on your PT and working on your sleep.
** Thank you for getting me a gigantic bag of mints.
*** They're very strong.
** You're very good at explaining stories in a concise and understandable way.

** Thank you for sharing your computer when mine broke.
** Thank you for reasoning with me about the diffuser and dryer. 
*** Also, for letting me get so much nondairy cream cheese - yummm... 
** I appreciate your attempts not to spoil stories for me.
*** I'll keep guessing anyway.
* 5c0ut
** You've got a [[stoic]] grindstone mindset that serves you well in difficult times. You know how to laugh at absurdity in some hard places too.
** You're an incredibly kind uncle.
** Thank you for being considerate in sharing space - I know it's rough to have lots of people all in the house, and you're very kind even when it gets crowded. 
** You're quite good at rapid rabbitholing while avoiding anything overwhelming.
