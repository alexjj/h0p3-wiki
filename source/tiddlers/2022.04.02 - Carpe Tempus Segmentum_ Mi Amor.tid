title: 2022.04.02 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Mi Amor

Woke at 4? Rumination + Meditation. [[TTTOTW]]. Leftovers, sausage pinwheels, tea with my sympaticon. Thinking about [[Impassionata]] and [[others]]. -Syu'n'reboot.

A wild kakatata appears...

[[TTTOTW]]. Couple Baal runs with my sympaticon. I'm playing highly defensively, and I'm not hosting so that I can HC Save/Quit (could technically AHK my way out of some of this, triggers). Everything feels so smooth with Insight and decent FCR. Max block only worries me for blocklocking, but it's probably still best. Max resists. I control and snowball, but I am only a bridge; I don't shine on my own. I'm missing the gumby slow, but the damage and control of freecasting is worthy (I remain unconvinced it will survive in Hell, despite max GM, not until I pick up at least +6 more skills).<<ref "n">> While HF (reaper on top is amazing, but why go that direction when the Nec has it handled?) is wildly my preference as solo Hammerdin, I think Defiance (normal mode gets the higher level aura, btw) is a better pick for the Trio. Raw physical damage mitigation is dope, especially for a plate caster who has to position in the pocket. Sorc has HF on hers, and given her teleport requirements, it's probably stronger on her (and Defiance is still a reasonable solo option for the Hammerdin, but it aint for the sorc).

[[5c0ut]] came down for our 1-on-1. Building some spreadsheets for accounting time and money. Pomos and soft music. [[TTTOTW]].

Assignments. Mi amor is grinding in her Greek. She stayed up till 5 binging last night. Lawd.

Few more Baal runs. NeckRomancer is 77. The methodical clearer. I'm tired of shitty loot. I want to move to Hell mode. [[TTTOTW]].

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. //Inform the Men!// //Raw Skintime// with mi amor. Meditation.

//The Walk// with mi amor. ùï±ùï¥ùïΩùï∞üî•. Saw Elaine with her son, on a walk, to hunt us down. She's losing her mind even faster. =(. Perfectly awkward. We also met Dan and Mark (a.k.a. Hotwheels). Dan's retiring in 15 months, rides a motorcycle, and is buying land. Classic boomer. 

//The Date// with mi amor. We went to Dunya's. Amazing. Got her some of that sauce too. 

//Don't Look Up// in [[The Den]]. Fell asleep before the end. It was not as funny as I was led to believe, though there was plenty of absurdity.
