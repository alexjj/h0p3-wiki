"""
[18:37:46][SCBA] 7/10
[18:38:58][h0p3] `/salute`.
[18:49:18][SCBA] Would you like to see mine?
[18:49:55][h0p3] Sure. That would be cool.
[18:50:06][SCBA] https://www.docdroid.net/ZE2crLW/1e5c05e9-aab3-42b5-90c3-2b37c7246416-pdf
[18:59:17][h0p3] So how long did it take you to write this?
[19:03:23][SCBA] They were de-centralised posts on 4chan. I do not know. Even though I am good at knowing how long things last.
[19:04:13][h0p3] How do you know the person who compiled it for you did a good job?
[19:04:36][h0p3] It's my honor to meet you, btw.
[19:05:05][h0p3] Are you a fan of SotS? (https://reddit.com/r/sorceryofthespectacle)
[19:06:12][SCBA] I think it  covers all of my posts. I do not remember much else from the assemblage of these 47 pages. 
[19:06:35][h0p3] Aye. That does seem like a difficult problem.
[19:06:46][h0p3] Wish my memory were much stronger. Seems to weaken over the years.
[19:06:50][SCBA] I am not familiar with that sub-reddit. Would you reccomend it?
[19:07:15][SCBA] recommend*
[19:07:51][SCBA] Seems like a decent one.
[19:08:13][h0p3] I don't know much about you, [[nomad]], but I think both you, the author, and the compiler of that pdf may find it an interesting place. It has evolved quite a bit over the years, and it belongs to a cluster of related subs, imho.
[19:09:36][SCBA] I think the compiler is lost in the k-space of /lit/. I never had the pleasure to meet him. The sub-reddit you provided does seem interesting.
[19:11:06][h0p3] Do you still spend much time on /lit/, and have we ever met before, [[anon]]?
[19:11:42][SCBA] I don't think so. I don't spend time on /lit/ anymore.
[19:11:50][h0p3] `/nod`
[19:20:17][h0p3] So what else do you work on? Seems like you might have a wide variety of interests.
[19:23:20][SCBA] I am working on nothing, to be honest. What I have been doing since I wrote is nothing but almost trivial. However, I do have a wide variety of interests. You might say.
[19:23:43][h0p3] `/nod`
[19:24:36][h0p3] I suppose more than one schizoposter has had someone compare their work to Dr. Bronner's label. 
[19:26:39][SCBA] I am ignorant of Dr. Bronner, who is he?
[19:28:07][h0p3] https://www.drbronner.com/collections/soaps-and-sanitizers
[19:28:19][h0p3] One of my favorite [[Root Users]], Sir [[DeathOfRobinhood]], sent me something that reminds me of the difficultty of parsing another person's seeming gibberish: https://philosopher.life/#2019.11.21%20-%20DeathOfRobinhood%3A%20H0P3%C2%B2%2C%20you%20madman!. I appreciate having the opportunity to carefully think about what people say to me, [[2019.11.22 - Antipleonasm Analysis: 〚TM™〛]]. 
[19:30:25][h0p3] So why did you end up writing your posts? Why did you stop? Why do you feel what you've written since then is almost trivial? 
[19:31:37][h0p3] Do you end up [[sharing]] your words with [[others]] often?
[19:33:12][h0p3] Walking through the fragments of a possible history of people referring to your work, e.g. https://warosu.org/lit/thread/16500027. Hence the Bronner comment (which, of course, I have also experienced).
[19:34:29][SCBA] I would lıke to have a perfect, all-encompassing memory so that I would not have to rely-on any medium to '[[sharing]] your words with [[others]]' at-all. However, I was ultimately defeated and took some quick notes. I believe this is all. I do not like to share my words with others since I remember.
[19:35:18][h0p3] `/nod`.
[19:36:02][h0p3] I am honored that you would share your words with me then. Thank you.
[19:36:04][SCBA] `Why do you feel what you've written since then is almost trivial?` Because I have wrote nothing since then.
[19:36:24][SCBA] It is my pleasure. Thank you too.
[19:38:06][h0p3] Do you end up re-using your notes, referring back to them, modifying them, or building more upon, even if only in memory and not on the screen?
[19:38:30][SCBA] As a matter of fact, I do.
[19:39:30][SCBA] Would you like me to continue?
[19:39:55][h0p3] I am listening. Yes, please.
[19:40:44][SCBA] I am sorry, I am not being clear. Would you like me to continue my work?
[19:41:25][h0p3] I have no idea. I don't have enough context to prescribe here. At this point, I'm just trying to understand.
[19:42:29][h0p3] So, yes, I do desire to understand, and continuing your work in a way that might clarify it would be something I would [[like]]. I also think what I like probably isn't a sufficient reason for much here. 
[19:44:12][h0p3] I'd like to know more about you and your life too. I think that's a good thing, and it might also aid in [[help]]ing me understand your work.
[19:44:25][SCBA] Yes, it is not but I always like to consider these things. 
[19:44:29][SCBA] My life?
[19:44:52][h0p3] Aye. 
[19:45:32][SCBA] Well, what do you want to hear about it?
[19:47:03][h0p3] Well, I recognize there are limits to expressing everything I'd like to hear about within this medium. I'm happy to begin with [[Getting to Know Someone in X Questions]]. 
[19:47:06][h0p3] What brings you here today? What do you do to survive in the world? What do you think matters most? Do you think we just move stuff around? What are some of the most controversial opinions you hold, the sort you might be persecuted for? What are some of your biggest regrets in life?
[19:47:15][h0p3] What do you want most in this world, and why? What do you fear most, and why? What or who do you love most, and why? What or who do you hate most, and why? Are you religious/spiritual, and to what extent does it influence your life? What's your purpose in life? If you are dictator of the world for a year, what changes would you make, and why? What do you like to read, watch, listen to?
[19:47:50][h0p3] [[Humor]] (because I've been unironically asked these myself, and please do laugh and destroy these questions): Are you a bot? What MLM do you represent?
[19:48:18][h0p3] And, what questions do you think I should be asking?
[19:48:54][SCBA] Can I ignore some?
[19:49:05][h0p3] Yes, whatever suits you. `/nod`.
[19:59:09][SCBA] I fear spiders the most. I love knowledge (and deriving it) and ayanami rei the most. I hate inferior things most. I am not religious. I am not a bot -- although debatable. I do not know what MLM is. I like to listen to nightcore, marches and anthems, baroque, classical and some avant-garde russian. My dictate would depend on what side I chose from white(positive/constructive for 1 category)/black(negative/destructive for all category) from the initial reference point of the time I held the power. 
[20:01:01][SCBA] I also love liberty, and possibly order and possibly entropy, to add.
[20:04:09][h0p3] You play any [[vidya]] [[games]]? Rei Ayanami seems like quite a character. 
[20:05:22][h0p3] I know nothing of avant-garde russian. Are there any Chad Vlads in that space I should check out?
[20:06:02][SCBA] I do play video games. I some-what like paradox grand strategy games, chess and factorio. I don't like playing them very much. They feel like a waste-of-time. Most things do.
[20:06:23][h0p3] `/nod`. I used to play more myself as well.
[20:06:42][h0p3] Been working [[MTG: The Proxy Cube]] lately though. That's been a pleasure.
[20:10:42][SCBA] I like text adventure games and I like playing text-adventure-like games of my own imagination on notebook. For Russian-Avant-Garde I liked Mayakovsky's poem turned to a song. Radio of The Future from Velimir Khlebnikov with Prelude by Rachmaninov created by Nikolai Voinov in 1932, using his "paper sound" technique. What is [[MTG: The Proxy Cube]]?
[20:11:36][h0p3] https://philosopher.life/#MTG%3A%20The%20Proxy%20Cube
[20:12:26][h0p3] All [[Links]] (enclodes in double brackets) pick out a page (or is [[alias]]ed to a page) in my ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱.
[20:12:35][h0p3] enclosed*
[20:13:07][SCBA] Promising. 
[20:14:20][h0p3] If you have the [[chance]] to share those songs, let me know. I'd like to hear 'em. I'm a fan of that Rachmaninov feller. 
[20:14:44][SCBA] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIR3pCgqb5o
[20:14:46][h0p3] I think you'd fit right in at our home, [[The Alien Asylum]], with those text-adventure games. 
[20:15:08][SCBA] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZP7Xv6vcCLw
[20:15:27][h0p3] Dope
[20:19:23][h0p3] What do you think about the state of the world? What ought persons like ourselves do about it, if anything? 
[20:20:23][h0p3] And, also, I speak asynchronously with people. No need to respond in a timely fashion. We get to speak when we do!
[20:24:24][SCBA] SUNLIGHT'S COLONIZATION OF THE DREAM WORLD: in other words, the ways the Cartesian immediacy of the waking state comes to marginalize the Yesodic/turiyanic subterra of the soul: Hegel's dialectic is only a description of /the self-movement of the world outside our participation/: of how the world must spin when we are sleeping/dead: as with Heraclitus, in sleep we are alone together, in society (awake, under the Sun), we are together alone: Spirit is the aloneness of the soul become communal, in the Day of Atum, not the Night of reckoning we are confronted with at death, hence its circularity: unable to sound the Deep of its processing, Hegel's absolute becomes the solipsism of the iceberg's tip: there is no immortality in Hegel, the particular subject dies and it is only the rational substance of the society that succeeds him, it always goes on after us, there is no solace for the soul after its extinction but how the rest of Being will take up its task/avenge its pain: every death is a promise Hegel's God makes to the living because it is only the living that can receive it: and what is the content of that promise? The Omega Point at the end of history whose gravity we experience as time: the Omega Point that is responsible for every utterance of the phrase “life goes on”: the final, bloody orgasm of Atum “retaking his semen into his mouth”: only the infinity of time can heal the particular loss: or more precisely, the promise is that at the terminus of history, our position will afford us the perspective to retroactively justify everything that preceded it: it is being /ejected from our immanence to time that is heaven/: the Final Judgment, in other words, is a /formal/ guarantee: God cannot promise the moment, only the afterglow: coincidentally, why photos haunt with a razor's edge, photography embalms the instant, but the instant must wane, and time is that waning, the abyss of a glance: her eyes were a depth not even God could make good on.
[20:26:06][SCBA] Good Night.
[20:26:21][h0p3] Good night. `/salute`.
