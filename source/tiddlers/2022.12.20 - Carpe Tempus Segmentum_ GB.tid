Phased in and out until I rose at 6? [[TTTOTW]]. Mi amor was up. She made the coffee, and I wandered with my blanket. Meeting that Rwandan woman, giving books, a meal. An argument about the nature of communion. `/nod`. 

Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. A message from Sir [[GB]]. Made sure my daughter was ready (and I'm standing by in case she needs me). Coffee and leftover chicken + hot sauce. Reading his dissertation with my sympaticon. 

//Skintime// + //Stardust// with my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]]. Also, [[wrestling]] with mi amor on her sermon. It turned out excellent (and, surprisingly on topic or adjacent to the dissertation, although in a different language).

My daughter's appointment was fine. Doc asked me for my opinion, so I joined the conversation. Made it clear that I'm going to support whatever my daughter chooses, and I didn't think SSRI's made any sense. Our charts are solid, she accepted our reasoning, and my daughter gets another attempt. I don't think medication will solve the problem, in this case, but I am willing to try. It's at least a trail of evidence.

[[TTTOTW]]. My goodness, [[Sir GB]]'s dissertation is about a very hard topic. I come at it from out left field too, and I'm not moved by some of the problematics. I probably don't understand it well enough either. I don't. Lol. My sympaticon worked on getting her comms up and finding more places to live. Saw [[5c0ut]] for a bit with my daughter. Wasn't in trouble, and able to work from home a bit. Will be a calm before the storm. He was in good spirits, imho. 

The Offspring came down to grind. My son made more progress on the manifesto until he decided to try out the dissertation. My daughter layed out our choices with tradeoffs for list comprehension or sets, and we chose to keep the order if we can, then she joined in reading [[GB]]'s work. We read very slowly. [[TTTOTW]]. Two people sent me messages about [[E.T.]] today, and we're also planning on watching it as part of my daughter's psych kick.

Mi amor called. Walking through our days. 

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. //Inform the Men!// Meditation. [[TTTOTW]].

[[Family Gathering]] was dope. Stir fry was good, and water too. Clarinet. Watched the first half of //No Country For Old Men//. Gotdayum that is a good movie. Unfortunately, my offspring are struggling to stay awake during it. They were more fascinated by [[Sir GB]]'s dissertation, but that is much harder to have any understanding of.

[[TTTOTW]]. Assisting my sympaticon with preparing for speaking on the phone with folks, having questions she cares about (GPT-3 came in handy), getting her warm. She's hunting.
