* Human beings are beings of excess with exorvant energy, fantasies, drives, needs ,and heterogeneous desire.
* The capitalist imperatives of labor, utility, and saving are unnatural, and go against human nature.
* We can escape the existing imperatives of utility (capitalism) by pursuing a 'general economy' of expenditure, giving, sacrifice, and destruction
