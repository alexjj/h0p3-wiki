Thought is a means of concealing the truth.

Holy god, that thought is deep AF, bro. I wonder what "truth" you think you're concealing with that thought. Note, you've consistently failed to define "thought." It's an obvious weakness in your rhetoric.

Look, I get it: Einstein's relativity, facing the deep problematics of German idealism and representation, and the proven deconstruction of both our access to a complete foundation to mathematics and our ideal hopes for the ability to demonstrate what is true given the limitations of our languages, etc., etc., have thrown profound post-modern curveballs at us. The ancient cross-cultural paradoxes and [[infinigress]]es continue to plague us. There's something to be said for it. I suppose we'll have to think and feel about its truth, eh? What else are we going to do? What else ought we do? You see, I think you aim to deny our telos, and I take your claim to be a hostile one made in bad [[faith]].

I'm glad you at least acknowledge that there is truth. So many throw it away in the end, deny its reality, or act like it can never really be known. Imagine the hubris of thinking one knew the truth that there was no truth to be known, as though it's just an illusion to them, trapped in solipsism, or so they dishonestly say to themselves. Even elite academics of the philosophical discipline get it wrong quite often, and, obviously, you are one of them to some degree. `/sigh`.

Thought can be used to conceal the truth from particular agents in some cases. It is not exclusively a means to doing so, and, in fact, the uncovering of truth can only be completed through thought. You continue to push against thinking. Let me guess: you think it's immediately felt and presently experienced and that somehow this isn't in virtue of thought at all.<<ref "s">> `/smh`. I know what that probably means: you don't really believe in truth either. And, you will have my [[silence]] in return. At some point, it is no longer my duty to think with those who deny the value, realism, and efficacy of thinking.
