title: 2020.10.16 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Being Closer To The Age Of The Universe Than To A Planck

It's been a day of maximum autisticy. Simple.

* Read
* AFireman Time!
* Read
* LoL+Chips
* Sleep by 6:30
* Woke at 1
* [[Morning Routine]]
** Long meditation time. Wandered forever.
** Arms have recovered sooner than my legs. Offspring claim to have run. We should speed the process up again.
* Walk With Offspring
** Baby snakes have been showing up dead on the trail. Tiny little ones.
** Wasn't a fun walk. =/. It happens. At least they get their devices for the evening.
* Read+Write
* Chat with [[DeathOfRobinhood]]
** If you all have the time on Sunday, I'd like you to meet my family over the phone. You pick the time. I want them to hear your voice too. =)
** Thank you for speaking with me. `/tears`. It is always my honor to know your wife obtains. She chooses to radically [[share]] her life with [[others]], and it makes lives worth living, the sort that I [[hope]] and {[[dream]]} will live forever in paradise or even as an eternal well in the desert. Your wife embodies and instantiates The Golden Rule and something even higher. 
** Bouldering is a kind of weightlifting. 
*** Thinking about mountains of people bouldering each other.

** Crumbs fell out of schmeegulls beard on her like snow. Through much wretching, [[Miss Direction]] demanded he shave it off (wasn't clear if it was a joke or not). So, he shaved it off. Now there is an evil scientologist's circle-beard, mistress.
*** She was then surprised when he actually did it and cursed him ;P. She misses Karl Marx, and now she has a lame devil.

Considering ranting against INTPs, of course. Perfectly normal.

* I hope they go with i2pd packaged alongside Cabal by default. Unfortunately, there's bootstrapping, and I don't know what a minimal connection needs to look like. Probably should be pre-configured to fit (and maybe even needs to be something that is ratcheted up and down automagically, eventually). 
** There's a non-trivial chance that many users cannot get i2p(d) working on their machines. I think anyone who can should be default bridges into the network too. Might as well glue the inner and outer from the beginning, in and out proxies.
** Seems like a place to have F2F Retroshare going on.
