title: 2020.07.19 - Prompted Introspection: Helping ALM

!! Describe a time you helped someone.

At first glance, this question is a great place to merely virtue signal, but the unhelpful answer in [[2019.07.30 - Prompted Introspection: Halping]] demonstrates I've not taken it seriously enough. I've also had times in my life where I thought I was helping someone and I wasn't. There's plenty of depth to mine here. I also don't know how big or small I'm supposed to go here. It's wide open. 

[[ALM]] has received plenty of help from me over the decades. He has a wife, children, escaped working as a shift manager at Target, escaped his abusive control-freak mother, actually went to college, traveled the world, learned how to play plenty of games, learned to read books, learned to use his computer, was forced to actually wrestle with his [[faith]], learned what it meant to be a dad, and wasn't a lonely person who committed suicide (as well as saving his marriage and his wife's life at great cost to my own family) because I intervened again and again in his life - [[WINTCIS]]. He's been a vampire in my life. Despite the fact that we will probably never speak again, I am glad that I was able to be of use to him.
