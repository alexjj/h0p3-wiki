hi

I wasn't online much lately

things have been a bit chaotic on my side (as always) and it turns out I'm basically going back to windows for almost everything

so I decided to set up qtox there too

CC8CF120488DE9A5B0B68E452D947F34CA3D46F0B70C6E9F40BA1B15D730F139B659E1428F34

here's my new ID


[12:47:19] b3nsn0w: hi
[12:47:33] h0p3: Yo! =)
[12:47:42] h0p3: Been a while. How goes the chaos?
[12:48:06] b3nsn0w: just when I thought it was finally getting manageable it started introducing a bunch of new stuff
[12:48:10] b3nsn0w: so, still chaotic
[12:48:44] b3nsn0w: working on a random app now that didn't exist even as an idea or a team 10-ish days ago
[12:49:13] h0p3: Neat. What will the app do?
[12:49:59] b3nsn0w: some positive psychology thing for helping to recover humanity's collective mental health from covid, or something like that
[12:51:13] b3nsn0w: apart from that freelancing takes way too much time nowadays, family is adding to the chaos since covid is ramping up here so it's hard to schedule stuff
[12:51:19] b3nsn0w: plus it's nanowrimo, I wanna write
[12:51:23] b3nsn0w: just can't find the damn time for it
[12:51:28] b3nsn0w: anyway, what's up on your side?
[12:53:01] h0p3: That is a ton. I hope everyone is healthy. CV19 and the stress continues to ramp up around here too (so far, our family has avoided a lot of it, `/knock-on-wood`). 
[12:53:30] h0p3: High correlation with mental illness after having contracted CV19 too.
[12:54:45] h0p3: I'm hanging in there. 
[12:54:53] h0p3: Kinda curled up lately
[12:55:41] h0p3: Watching the world, hoping my offspring will choose to do their work without my intervention (cause intervention aint working lol), might be getting a house here. 
[12:56:18] h0p3: As usual, reading and writing. 
[12:56:29] b3nsn0w: how is the change for you on that front?
[12:56:39] b3nsn0w: if I remember correctly you were already homeschooling them before the whole virus thing
[12:58:57] h0p3: I am doing my best to demonstrate to them what it means for me to be hands-off. I keep a totally different schedule. I don't even talk about the topic with them at all during the week. Part of it is handing them evidence (yet again) that accountability can be valuable and that my constant interference in their lives is not the reason they aren't getting their work done (though my daughter consistently attempts to rationalize it as such). 
[12:59:14] h0p3: I have more freetime to jerk off, so that's nice.
[12:59:34] b3nsn0w: lol
[13:00:08] h0p3: It's difficult for me because I've spent a huge amount of my life, significant career sacrifices included, to homeschool. 
[13:00:21] h0p3: I barely get to see them even a couple hours a day. Killing me.
[13:01:11] h0p3: But, it's okay. I have no room to really complain. This was going to happen. They will have to have their own space. I have to grow up too, lol.
[13:01:29] b3nsn0w: yeah, I think every parent goes through that
[13:01:47] b3nsn0w: kids don't always see it the same way, or even have the same priorities as you
[13:02:06] b3nsn0w: I know I had a very different idea than my parents did, was a nightmare to handle it at times
[13:03:23] b3nsn0w: on the other side, if there is something you really wanna do and your parents just don't get it, you don't really have a choice, you either make them get it or just give up on it
[13:04:29] b3nsn0w: I don't know why they aren't getting their work done, but when I didn't, it was because I wanted to do other things that I flat out wouldn't have had time for, at all
[13:04:38] b3nsn0w: so in the end, I've established myself as the kid who never does any sort of homework
[13:05:09] b3nsn0w: manage expectations, fight the occasional battle, and enjoy the free time that you can now pour straight into something you're actually excited for
[13:05:25] h0p3: You seem well-motivated to me. 
[13:05:52] h0p3: I have very inclusive, broad expectations. I just want them to do their best.
[13:06:00] h0p3: She's 14. She still has room to screw up some, though it's costly now. 
[13:06:28] h0p3: There's like a 5% chance she attends Yale here. I wish she would take that more seriously. Lol.
[13:06:49] b3nsn0w: does she want to?
[13:06:57] h0p3: She claims that would good.
[13:07:00] h0p3: be*
[13:07:19] h0p3: She wants play on the internet. The addiction is strong with this one. I know the feel.
[13:07:46] b3nsn0w: yeah, I see
[13:07:51] b3nsn0w: uni is kind of a weird topic
[13:07:56] b3nsn0w: (said the guy who never went to one...)
[13:08:45] b3nsn0w: I got two sisters (2 and 4 years younger than me), the older one wants to be an architect
[13:08:56] h0p3: I have written many times and spoken with them dozens of times about the possibility of not going. There are viable routes. The signaling of the piece of paper alone is hard to beat here. 
[13:09:27] b3nsn0w: yeah, that's true, some fields do require it
[13:10:09] b3nsn0w: my sister pretty much needs one, and she's flying past uni basically, not straight A's but she's getting it done, and much more efficiently than anyone else I know
[13:10:35] b3nsn0w: because it's aligned with her dreams, so that's what she's working on now
[13:11:04] b3nsn0w: on my side, I could never get uni to be a big part of who I wanted to be, that's why I ultimately didn't end up going
[13:11:30] b3nsn0w: not because I was lazy or wanted to underachieve (even though underachiever was basically my identity throughout school, for those expectations)
[13:11:47] b3nsn0w: it's just that a piece of paper wasn't really something worth fighting for
[13:11:58] b3nsn0w: and it does take a crazy amount of time
[13:12:09] h0p3: You could always go and get it, I assume. 
[13:14:40] h0p3: Timing is everything for us here. I can't afford to pay for school. They have to get scholarships if they are going to avoid profound debt. Getting into a good school and getting a free ride is unlikely to occur if they don't jump on it by 19ish. 
[13:16:14] h0p3: There is a radical different between a community college and a serious university here. Miles different. If they aim for more than a piece of paper, then the high-stakes test that likely dictates much of the rest of their life is coming. 
[13:17:07] h0p3: They have more room to screw around in their later 20's than they do in their later teens.
[13:17:16] h0p3: But, up to them.
[13:18:29] h0p3: If education isn't the real goal and the piece of paper isn't what they want, I'd hunt for a wealthy, high compatibility mate if I were my daughter. I'd do tradeschools and join multiple unions as my son.
[13:19:03] h0p3: Also, how's the move to full-time Windows?
[13:19:47] h0p3: You got that subsystem, I suppose T1 Hypervisor + passthrough too if necessary.
[13:20:09] b3nsn0w: yeah, although most of it is just the one ubuntu 20.04 I got installed in WSL 2
[13:20:37] b3nsn0w: got a docker on it too, makes it super simple to set up traditionally linux-only servers like couchdb or redis for development
[13:21:00] b3nsn0w: I do have a few pet peeves, for example NTFS is still total crap at handling lots of tiny files
[13:21:42] b3nsn0w: but with the amount of stuff I do nowadays and the lengths I push my computer, I'll take that inconvenience over managing two environments and having to reboot to code
[13:21:59] b3nsn0w: I still like linux better, but I'm starting to feel that ecosystem that keeps people on windows
[13:22:43] b3nsn0w: also, wallpaper engine is amazing, that's a nice plus
[13:23:02] h0p3: They do a good job attracting the dev crowd. Might even be eating into the macOS folks lately.
[13:23:21] b3nsn0w: I hope so...
[13:23:38] b3nsn0w: my former boss is one of the people I usually work with on the freelance stuff
[13:23:45] b3nsn0w: his main computer is a mac
[13:24:06] b3nsn0w: and he's having constant issues with it, especially on skype, but for example the other day it just flat out refused to launch any desktop apps
[13:24:49] b3nsn0w: and from a dev perspective, I'm tired of catering to apple users (although I don't think that's gonna go away anytime soon)
[13:24:53] b3nsn0w: there is always a safari bug
[13:25:05] b3nsn0w: several, usually
[13:26:05] b3nsn0w: but about windows, I'm still surprised how far microsoft came since they got rid of ballmer and nadella became the CEO
[13:26:55] b3nsn0w: aside from that ntfs thing and the stray incompatibility here and there I'm not finding anything lacking on windows
[13:27:29] b3nsn0w: and even for the ntfs thing they have a solution, you could somehow get vs code to remote into WSL and run the project there, with apparently better filesystem performance
[13:27:56] b3nsn0w: the whole thing is just surprisingly okay, and everything is here
[13:28:36] b3nsn0w: the good part of freelancing taking so much time nowadays is it pays by the hour, and with that I've been getting a bit crazy with my rig lately
[13:29:02] b3nsn0w: upgraded to a 2070 super, gave my sister the 1070, then took the 1050 ti that came out of her rig and just put it into mine as a second GPU
[13:29:09] b3nsn0w: because I have too many monitors for the 2070 to handle
[13:30:17] b3nsn0w: and for example that stuff just simply works on windows, while I haven't even managed to set it up on linux
[13:30:54] h0p3: Out-of-the-box just werx on Windows is dope.
[13:31:33] h0p3: I hate setting up so many things on Linux. 
[13:32:33] h0p3: Given the way you do your monitors, windows tiling management is almost irrelevant. I would find Windows especially alluring as a gamer too.
[13:33:09] b3nsn0w: I think they even have some tiling management in some power tools thing they did lately
[13:33:17] b3nsn0w: not sure, never used that even on linux
[13:34:02] b3nsn0w: but yeah, I like to keep lots of monitors more than splitting up an existing one
[13:36:54] h0p3: I've used virtual desktops for a long time on Windows, but it's not the same for me. I need it not because I'm highly organized but the exact opposite: it contains the chaos. I have a glorified browser machine mostly, and browser window+tab management just can't be done inside the browser.
[13:38:04] b3nsn0w: yeah, it's kinda the same for me on the chaos part
[13:38:20] b3nsn0w: I still use the three main monitors and a few desktops, mostly
[13:38:38] b3nsn0w: currently I have three on windows, still missing my 2x2 linux layout somewhat
[13:40:00] b3nsn0w: that thing is basically exponential, it's basically 9 monitors worth of desk space now, with an option for 12 with the side monitor
[13:40:26] b3nsn0w: plus I wanna add a 7" touchscreen used mostly for raspberries, as a dedicated screen for the music player
[13:40:46] b3nsn0w: or something like that, got the idea from a jayztwocents video and it's just way too cool not to do
[13:40:54] h0p3: haha
[13:41:59] h0p3: I have a workspace called "Sound" lol...I just throw it all in there. Keybindings mapped to Deadbeef, but I find I'm stuck in browsers more and more there too. 
[13:42:08] h0p3: I'm not good at finding music.
[13:42:34] b3nsn0w: I'm kinda bouncing back and forth on that one
[13:42:54] b3nsn0w: I do use Tidal, which is pretty good at getting the mainstream stuff
[13:43:19] h0p3: Tidal is big guns. I'm a youtube and spotify pleb, lol.
[13:43:35] b3nsn0w: it has one problem though, you can't upload your own music
[13:43:59] b3nsn0w: been driving me a bit crazy, because there are a few great albums from TSFH that are industry-only releases
[13:44:29] h0p3: To my eyes, Deadbeef houses the songs I keep local, and everything else is discovery for that local library.
[13:44:29] b3nsn0w: plus the life is strange soundtrack isn't on it either, only a few tracks they licensed in the first place
[13:44:48] b3nsn0w: that sounds nice
[13:45:25] b3nsn0w: I did install AIMP lately, now I'm basically managing two libraries, but the local one isn't something I'd call comprehensive
[13:45:56] b3nsn0w: the other day I found a weird storefront on Tidal, kinda hidden, where you can just straight up buy mp3 or flac files
[13:46:16] b3nsn0w: I think I might do that for the stuff I actually listen to
[13:46:21] h0p3: AIMP looks like a souped up Winamp.
[13:46:32] b3nsn0w: I don't mind paying for music, but I will indiscriminately pirate anything they don't let me buy
[13:46:37] b3nsn0w: yeah, it's pretty much like winamp
[13:46:45] b3nsn0w: or I suppose, never actually used winamp
[13:46:51] b3nsn0w: just wanted something more advanced than vlc
[13:47:27] b3nsn0w: but AIMP is damn nice even on its own, and then there are like a million plugins for it
[13:47:48] b3nsn0w: playlist management is a bit weird, but I'm getting used to it
[13:48:14] b3nsn0w: have you heard of extrememusic btw?
[13:48:25] h0p3: Nope. Never heard of it.
[13:48:38] b3nsn0w: it's a stock music site, and TSFH uploads all their music to it
[13:48:48] b3nsn0w: well, almost all, I don't think they have humanity chapter 2 yet
[13:48:54] b3nsn0w: anyway, that's where the industry albums are
[13:49:06] b3nsn0w: and you're not supposed to be able to download it unless you have actually licensed it
[13:49:21] b3nsn0w: well, they have a weird API
[13:49:44] b3nsn0w: it's kinda tedious, but if you really want to, you can just download everything through the network tab of firefox devtools
[13:49:58] b3nsn0w: play the track, find the file it loads, and just grab it
[13:50:36] b3nsn0w: I didn't wanna do that though for 3384 tracks
[13:51:02] h0p3: DRM for music on the web is impossible.
[13:51:20] h0p3: I don't even know why they try.
[13:51:36] b3nsn0w: widewine can get kinda close, but literally everything else can be broken with the devtools
[13:51:52] b3nsn0w: but yeah, extreme didn't try too much
[13:52:15] b3nsn0w: probably the execs said it needs to be somewhat protected, and they basically just made sure a dumb attempt wouldn't work
[13:52:38] h0p3: Good guys devs living up to letter of the law but the spirit.
[13:52:42] h0p3: but not* the spirit
[13:53:31] h0p3: I'm fine with rips from the audio feed too. Back in the day, we used capture devices for some things.
[13:53:42] b3nsn0w: yeah, your ears are analog
[13:53:48] b3nsn0w: anything they hear can be recorded
[13:54:21] b3nsn0w: drm ends right there, if someone's gonna do widewine I'm not above just plugging the jack into a simple recording device
[13:54:44] b3nsn0w: also, fun thing, I'm actually building a system for one of extreme's direct competitors, they're one of the freelance clients
[13:54:56] b3nsn0w: so this drm thing did come up
[13:55:22] b3nsn0w: and I think I accidentally made it stronger than extreme
[13:55:36] b3nsn0w: basically both of these systems consist of two layers
[13:55:52] b3nsn0w: one of them is the URL itself, which is a cloudfront signed url in both cases instead of just a static one
[13:56:05] b3nsn0w: that's not even about DRM, it's just to stop people from hotlinking
[13:56:48] b3nsn0w: and in that competitor's case, it's because that's also the system that would hold confidential files, so there should be at least some access control
[13:57:05] b3nsn0w: but it's not DRM, you either have the file or don't, once you do have a URL you can do whatever the hell you want with it
[13:57:18] b3nsn0w: getting the URL is the other hard part though, that's where the second layer comes in
[13:57:20] b3nsn0w: the API
[13:57:42] b3nsn0w: in our case, it's a custom solution through websocket with exactly zero encryption, DRM, or anything like that on it (aside from standard https of course)
[13:58:27] b3nsn0w: it's just custom, and while I do plan on putting it on npm, it's a custom offshoot of even that, so it's not the simplest to figure out
[13:59:02] b3nsn0w: still, that's just obscurity, and once you get a handle on that it's super simple to mess with, I don't think if someone wants to rip music off that site as bad as I wanted TSFH's music it's gonna have any chance at stopping them
[13:59:19] b3nsn0w: and I don't really care tbh, like you said, DRM is pretty much useless
[13:59:23] b3nsn0w: as for extreme though
[13:59:42] b3nsn0w: they did have an API key thing, which was a legitimate attempt at trying to stop someone from just externally using their API
[14:00:09] b3nsn0w: it's basically some weird site key that it generates on the client side
[14:00:22] b3nsn0w: it stays mostly static, but it does have a timestamp in it, and I couldn't find the logic that generates it
[14:00:46] b3nsn0w: so what I ended up doing is I just put electron into my ripper code
[14:01:00] b3nsn0w: it just boots up the site in a browser and steals this API key from the first network request that includes it
[14:01:14] b3nsn0w: and when it doesn't work anymore, it refreshes the site and steals another one
[14:01:17] h0p3: lol
[14:01:24] h0p3: Ghetto but works
[14:01:28] b3nsn0w: from that point, it was a dead simple rest API
[14:02:01] b3nsn0w: I've even implemented a search in the cli, solely by messing around with their site and looking at what it does through the network tab
[14:03:02] h0p3: (speaking of widevine: https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/11/2020-11-09-Google.md)
[14:03:59] h0p3: Oooo, that is very pretty.
[14:06:14] h0p3: I build my library like a simpleton: one song at a time. It drips very slowly. I can see downloading whole albums being useful for discovery though. 
[14:07:05] b3nsn0w: you can technically listen to it on extreme's site, but so far I've only found TSFH worth listening to there, and it can only do a per-album thing
[14:07:29] b3nsn0w: I like to do a per-album shuffle, figure out which tracks I really like, then add those to a favorites tier 1 playlist
[14:07:37] b3nsn0w: and then the tracks that I really like even among those go to tier 2
[14:11:31] h0p3: Yup. That makes sense. Filtering for the salience. 
[14:11:38] h0p3: You have music recommendation engines that have blown you away?
[14:11:59] b3nsn0w: not really
[14:12:20] b3nsn0w: youtube sometimes recommends me something nice, but anything I've ever tried to use deliberately was kinda crap
[14:12:46] b3nsn0w: tidal is especially terrible at it, and I kinda hate that their front page doesn't even care who you are, it's just a generic popular music page
[14:12:55] b3nsn0w: or maybe even advertising space? who the hell knows at this point
[14:15:17] h0p3: I am beginning to think this counts as evidence against ML's value in this space too. No serious improvement over social recommendation like Youtube and Pandora. 
[14:15:45] h0p3: I just want to dump 1k song titles into a box and have it shit out 1k new song titles.
[14:16:13] h0p3: That isn't happening anytime soon, I take it.
[14:16:47] b3nsn0w: the problem is figuring out the fitness function, IMO
[14:17:13] b3nsn0w: which immediately makes me want to go with a GAN
[14:17:20] b3nsn0w: seriously, that's still my favorite thing about AI
[14:17:36] b3nsn0w: two networks that basically train against each other, becoming each other's constantly improving fitness functions
[14:17:58] b3nsn0w: that's what enables things like AI Dungeon to sound so human-like, because that's literally the one job they have
[14:18:09] h0p3: Makes sense when talking about win conditions for a game. 
[14:18:20] h0p3: Easy to quantify that.
[14:19:30] h0p3: Harder to pick out what set of random waves patterns will trigger something in my brain that goes "Oh, I'm familiar enough with this pattern that it makes me feel safe (nostalgic perhaps) and just dissonant enough to give me surprise and happiness" 
[14:19:53] h0p3: https://www.dana.org/article/why-do-we-love-music/
[14:21:22] h0p3: I am the computer's adversary. We have to train each other as my music tastes change ever so slightly to continue offering a novelty path to feeding me pleasure chemicals.
[14:22:01] b3nsn0w: the problem is your bandwidth is way lower than what a computer wants
[14:22:12] b3nsn0w: AI is basically digital evolution
[14:22:36] b3nsn0w: you have to train generations upon generations of it, evaluating them, selecting the fittest ones, then mutating them and sending off the next generation
[14:22:51] b3nsn0w: the frequency of this process of evaluation is crucial
[14:23:10] b3nsn0w: that's why GANs do so well, because it closes the loop, the two AIs evaluate each other and you can go as fast as you'd like
[14:23:26] b3nsn0w: that's also how google's deepmind or whatever it was called got so great at those strategy games
[14:23:41] b3nsn0w: it basically trained against itself (and former versions of itself to never forget a strategy)
[14:25:23] h0p3: It's modeling a game that can be fully digitized. Despite doing my damnedest, I don't know how to digitize a model of me for this. 
[14:26:39] h0p3: If it could be even half accurate at picking out my music preferences, much greater dangers have risen in nudging I take it. Even a 5% chance to lead me down a monetized path would be insanely lucrative. 
[14:27:37] b3nsn0w: no one really knows how to model a human
[14:27:42] b3nsn0w: basically what GPT does if I'm not mistaken is it trains two AIs
[14:28:15] b3nsn0w: one of them gets the job to appear as human-like as possible
[14:28:15] b3nsn0w: while the other tries to tell a human and a machine apart
[14:28:26] b3nsn0w: it's grounded in reality through the second AI, which is trained on actual human-written text and data generated by the first AI
[14:28:37] b3nsn0w: and the second AI evaluates the fitness of the first
[14:29:03] b3nsn0w: the loop is closed, the first AI always gets closer to humans, and the second AI always finds imperfections in it, allowing the first one to patch them up
[14:29:15] b3nsn0w: I think we need something like that for music too
[14:29:50] b3nsn0w: the problem is, we can't train a separate AI for every single human, there is just not enough computing power for that
[14:30:13] b3nsn0w: so basically what we'd need to figure out is exactly the problem you've outlined in the beginning
[14:30:28] b3nsn0w: give the AI a list of songs and let it continue the list
[14:31:01] h0p3: GPT-style can attempt to predict the next musical symbol. It would be creating music though, not recommending.
[14:31:23] b3nsn0w: yeah, that's right
[14:31:26] b3nsn0w: it's not what we need
[14:31:37] h0p3: I would love that though too
[14:31:44] b3nsn0w: perhaps give the AI a list of songs and one more, and figure out if the one more fits the list?
[14:31:57] b3nsn0w: creating songs is great, but it's a much more complex problem
[14:32:16] b3nsn0w: and the thing with GPT-like AIs is they can only get as complex as their networks can go
[14:32:38] b3nsn0w: that's why it's such a big deal when they figure out a new type of neuron that the AI can use efficiently, it gives it new capabilities
[14:32:47] b3nsn0w: which it figures out how to utilize on its own
[14:33:15] b3nsn0w: to write good music, you need to understand a bunch about emotion that's just flat out complex as hell
[14:33:37] b3nsn0w: and we're trying to put together something that selects from already existing music
[14:33:55] h0p3: You have the have a human brain to develop a fitting theory of mind of another human brain. Both running on 20 watts
[14:34:37] h0p3: Wetwear is the only option. Just need to string together labgrown meat and pretend we aren't being unethical, lol.
[14:35:01] b3nsn0w: lol, that would be interesting
[14:35:43] b3nsn0w: although, I think we can actually find a way to build a recommendation engine here
[14:35:56] b3nsn0w: in one group, let's take half your playlist
[14:36:28] b3nsn0w: in the other, let's take one more song, either from the other half, or a random song from the Almighty Database Of All Songs
[14:36:53] b3nsn0w: and make an AI that guesses if the song is from your playlist or not
[14:37:20] h0p3: Sounds like it would overfit. 
[14:37:45] b3nsn0w: could be, yeah
[14:38:18] b3nsn0w: that's why you take a platform with millions of playlists in various genres and train the AI on randomly selected playlists
[14:38:25] b3nsn0w: that's why all AI needs data, lots of it
[14:38:37] h0p3: That may have a much better chance, aye.
[14:39:10] h0p3: Google and Apple are the only players in the Western world with that kind of data (perhaps only Google).
[14:39:31] h0p3: All my giggles to Google Music coming down.
[14:39:38] b3nsn0w: well, I'd say there are others too, just with orders of magnitude of less data
[14:39:47] b3nsn0w: I already miss GPM
[14:41:24] b3nsn0w: youtube music is a piece of shit, tidal doesn't let you upload anything, spotify can go to hell (also, afaik no uploads there either), and I haven't been able to find anything else yet that would have both a library and an upload option
