title: 2022.07.23 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Chill

Woke at 8. It was enough, and it was surprisingly cool. Gump. Fireman Time!

Hugs'n'bugs. Yogurt. [[TTTOTW]]. Laws in our town changed. We can have up to 5 chickens. Hrm.

//Skintime// with mi amor. Fireman Time!

A wild [[sabaLynx]] appears...(actually, yesterday*)

Leftovers. [[TTTOTW]]. We ended up not going to the beach, and I think that's a good thing. I think we should only go if we're all generally excited. Instead, it was a chill day.

[[D2]] with my sympaticon. We got Ashe past 73, so she is a kicker. Stripped down hope for her. Trying to cheat rush with Neck gathering pieces, since she cannot host. Bowchika is a pile, but she's doing alright I guess. Root beer shots.

Shopping @ W-Entity with mi amor. Picked up chems, hooks, pads. Feminine hygiene products maybe should be kept outside the bathroom, which is perhaps still too damp.

[[TTTOTW]]. Chilled with mi amor. Fell asleep on her bed. 

Curry + Rice, Water, //The Boys// with my sympaticon. Good god it's jumped the shark and flies off the cliff. It is pulp and drugs. `/nod`. 

//China, IL// + Massage. Sleep by midnight.
