title: 2020.12.10 - Prompted Introspection: Owe An Apology

!! What do you still owe someone an apology for?

I promised Beverly to stay in touch, to visit her again. I haven't. =(. It's now so long, I'm too ashamed to do it. It's not that I think she deserves it otherwise, but I'm still bound to my words (words that have not be overridden by our circumstances). I owe her an apology. It will have to be the first words I say to her.
