I stumbled upon you here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Marxism/comments/xy037b/what_exactly_is_western_marxism/. Combing through my tabs again before I fall asleep exhausted (my usual). Read your account because I was curious. I just wanted to say I have quite a bit in common with you. No need to [respond](https://philosopher.life/#Contact%20h0p3), but I'm down penpal if you are ever up for doing such a thing. `/salute`.

> Thanks. I am honestly not too great at Reddit, even though I have been here a while. Yes, I love writing back and forth with folks. Thanks for reaching out.
