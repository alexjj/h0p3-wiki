title: 2020.06.21 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: I Never Forgetti That I'm Someone's Reason 2 Smile, Especially As A Joke

* Woke at 11:30
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Walk+Talk
* Read+Write
* [[Family Time]]!
** I'd like to get to a point where I don't run the show. We slowly get there.
* 1-on-1s
** Just chillin. Strong opener. A mingling.
* Eatin' our frogs first: [[TTP]]s were, yet again, expensive to walk through. It wasn't pure hell. 
** I've had to push hard to integrate our wikis into our lives, usually the only person aiming for it. [[TTP]]s are like that. I'm sure it would be easier if I knew how to do it better.
** Even if I'm wrong about how to construct them, the practice and habit will remain valuable.
** It got easier at the end. We are slowly are building our scheduling mindset and practice together.  
*** I think they realize that we all have to engage in hypothesizing here too.
** Discussions of upcoming changes in July.
** I'm hoping my wife will continue to integrate too. She sets the minimum bar, and without her practice, she isn't in a great position to help it evolve.
** We're going to have to start [[Family Time]] earlier here soon; [[k0sh3k]] needs to be done by 9.
* Vapelyfe
* [[Fire.timeline]] discussion
** It's an experiment for the sake of [[Family Time]] (a.k.a. [[Family Time Timeline.tmpl]] that we're trying to sort and figure out).
*** It's gonna have to be custom for each person.
** The mana dump was annoying to [[k0sh3k]], but I would like to continue working that direction.
*** This piece shouldn't be custom, I think.
** Offspring helped [[k0sh3k]] build hers.
** We're tagging stuff [[Hot]]. [[Recent]], especially mind, is too large. Some things should be picked out though. Further, there are [[New]] pieces that have some kind of something extra for show-and-tell (I have no idea how to put my finger on it well enough). Importantly, we all get to pick out what is [[Hot]] for each other. [[The Golden Rule]] spreads its wings. 
*** It's not separating the wheat from the chaff, but the cream from the milk. It's a highlighter. Not everything is equal in the chaos of  this [[ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱]], and it varies with the context. I want to build a fire with and for my family. They have to help me figure out what matters. I am always dependent to some inescapable [[dok]] on the thoughts, feelings, interpretations, and naming of [[others]] to understand (I know that is an unpopular opinion). 
** As usual, I have absolutely no fucking clue what I'm doing. I [[hope]] we can figure something out that makes good sense. 
* Reading our wikis!
** We used the [[Fire.timeline]]. =).
*** Ugh. Order is wrong. Fail. 
*** I wonder how to build correct orders in the Fiery portion of the Fire. 
** Slowly, we make progress. 
* Kielbasa, kraut, onions, green beans
* Night walk
** So dark. Gorgeous.
** Practiced being quiet.
** Emergency: I had to shit, and I couldn't hold it. Thank god for the big leaves in the forest. Lol.
** I like how we break to law to walk on the path.
* Apple Pie!
* Walk+Talk
* Read+Write
* Chats 
* So worn out, I couldn't read or write.
* //The Newsroom//
* Sleep by 3:30
