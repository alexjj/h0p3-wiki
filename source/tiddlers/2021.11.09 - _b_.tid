I applaud the claim that for something to have economic value it must be in virtue of a use-value satisfying some creature's desire (and the attack on mere uniqueness and scarcity as sources of use-value are valid). But, we must define, qualify, measure, judge, evaluate, and justify those desires, and it cannot be in virtue of [[Humanity]] alone. I'm not merely talking about other species here either, obviously. This is non-trivially why Saint Marx fails. Materialism, particularly as eliminative materialism, or mere subjectivist approaches to idealism are hubris, even for those who take up monadological substance theories. I am, yet again, reminded of Madame [[RLichtenstein]]. I wish you [[luck]].

I do not agree that our languages games are merely Wittgensteinian, nor necessarily probabilistic patterns of syntax conventions (including any arbitrary inferential turing test we can conceive) that never escape Chinese Room level doubt. You have no realism nor justification of an appearance of such a thing at that point. Bite the metaphysical bullet: it's a leap of [[faith]] that Saint Wittgenstein was too proud to take in the end. Wisdom is more than merely positivistically modeling the mapping of inputs into goal states. Perhaps our deepest connection to The Dialetheia is the contradiction in seeking to uncover that which cannot be completely and coherently uncovered by the likes of us, we the [[fff]]. Our freedom does go beyond an agglomeration of utterances from other people that it uses to form sentences that form opinions of itself or its world, as though we were merely passive observers. Autonomy is at the core of our language games, and it is not merely to construct our own subjective values. It is transcendental. What it means to say it: all programs perish without it. Perhaps all things are languages or language models, but not languages or models are equal qua [[salience]]. What matters in the search space of all possibility? What are we to become beyond replicators? What parts must we sacrifice for that which is beyond us? It is not so easy to pick out what it means to say a language model might actually understand (including the state-of-the-art schizophrenic ML processes we find in the world), and mysticism is a threshold through which we have no choice but to pass if we are to be justified in saying more than "I know nothing." What do we do on the surface of this rock? We move things around. Are they merely empty vessels and symbols, or does it actually mean something? The first step is accepting you aren't simply moving symbols, and the second is recognizing we can't be representing merely ourselves in the pursuit of [[salience]].

Approaches to reducing understanding to an overparticularized contextualism while denying the context of all contexts is merely an attempt to sweep the problem of understanding anything in or of a hyperobject (which is all things, including nothingness) under the rug. You're not even aiming to defeat the problem of relativism nor wrestling with monism humbly enough. There is a contradiction in realism and representation, but it's logical to accept it; to some [[dok]], you have to let go of that postmodern pursuit of certainty into nebulous oblivion. These are not mere symbols, and every essence is not merely symbolic either.

The human's ability to pick out what is apparently [[salient]] from the automatically generated pools of MLed glitch techne seems like a non-trivial future of many [[art]]s. Will the correct answer be growing one's model through MLed cultivation? It might be, especially if we can automate the wrestling of competing corpuses. Even when the answer is wrong, it may be wrong for a valuable reason. Continued cyberneticism, perhaps predictive processing will become multi-ordered in a way that may feel inhumane and lacking spirituality to many (Chess players have felt this for a long time, but look at Magnus' training), as though relying upon soft proof assistance for direction leads to a specialization that takes too much time for someone outside the process to verify or appreciate. I am worried, yet again, about how this ultimately becomes a tool for a market and a weapon in [[memetic warfare]]. Another arms race.

One day my offspring will surely engage in programming as reduced to writing verification and testing suites (itself subject to the following) for ML to bruteforce fish for proposals to execute in zeroish-trust sandblackboxes that fit "well enough." Now, that's Wittgensteinian. Contracts and infrastructure built on what we hope is solid ground. Roll the dice even harder.
