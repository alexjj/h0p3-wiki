* Repairman came. I told him what my son thought it was (and what I agreed it was too), and he looked and also agreed. He took it apart, added the metal brackets, he was unworried about the smoke alarm (we agreed on the cause), and he's recommending his friend, the landlord, actually do the work to fix this further than he did (or, he is simply exceptionally polite). 
** Talked about the fact that it's electric and crazy expensive. Yessir. I hear that. 
** He asked me if we were going to be staying for a long time. Hrm. Curious. I said my wife was the boss. His response was, "Are you Chinese?"
*** I am autistic as ever. I do not know what he means by the question, and I said that. I thought he was making a point about my wife being the boss, lol. Nope. Literally networking with me like the wealthy Chinese in this area seem to do. I spoke English with him, and most of the older Chinese I know do not speak English with each other. I wonder what was going through his head. I think I'm missing something. Of course, I do have squinty eyes (not gorgeously, but caveman-like, blinded by the light)...maybe some percentage in me, if I'm lucky (I hope my great grand, grand, grandmother was a hawt azn; oh, gamgam, give it to me), but I don't feel like I look very Asian. He thought so, or he was fucking with me. Either way, much appreciated.
** Thank the man profusely. Yessired up the wazoo. He decided to inspect the house for gas. 
** My wife said it's my facial hair that makes me look that way.

** Getting dark so early now. Cold. A dozen complaints. Worth.
** She had a really good day. More upbeat than I'd have predicted, especially on her period. 
*** I think she's kinda found her people, or at least at one layer/dimension. Her humor and ability to generate talking points from thin air. She is a marvelous autist, naturally making moves that construct or enable others to climb at least the standard Dunbar scaffolding with ease. I'm jelly of female autists in this regard. 
** Gearing up for what may be one helluva a month. 
** I hope she wears those horns and boots for me.
* My offspring decided to spend some time with us. Hugs. Everyone's looking happy enough.
