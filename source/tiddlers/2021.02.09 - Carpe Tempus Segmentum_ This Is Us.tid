title: 2021.02.09 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: This Is Us

My daughter read a [[poem|Poem: I Am A Beggar Always]] today with no context. I asked her for her opinion; I trust her opinion.<<footnote "s" "She knows I don't read so good, so she's helping her retard out. She knows how [[blinded by the light|2019.02.24 - TLDR: A Car Ride]] I am.">> She said to me, "This is you. This is you with me." [[Oy|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hj83cwfOF3Y]]. I lost my breath for a moment. That is too much to take in. Had to hug and hold her right there (my second one I stole this morning). Sometimes, everything is obvious to my daughter, like she anticipates it all.<<footnote "p" "She even picks out that my rapidfire, realtime [[/b/]]ish chat is unlike me.">> I am not satisfied by being a beggar, but I'm lucky to be one.

My wife read this poem again today in context. It is a much softer poem than I understood. You pick it well. I wish I knew how to pick poems for you. I'm sorry.<<footnote "c" "Caveman no understand poetry (though he tries).">> She also said it's me. Of course. Yes, ma'ams. I wear {[[my heart|About]]} on my sleeve.

There is one line I wrote that [[terrifies|2019.11.03 - Antipleonasm Analysis: أحبك حتى لو ضاع في الترجمة]] me. Anyone with a heartbeat who would read this weighty line would be. We all paused on it. "Holy fuck." Even my daughter and wife were hurt by it, and I didn't even say it to them. Oh my god. What have I done? I hate that terrible sentence. I hate my guts for saying it. I am a brutal fool.
