; 1924-1998: Jean-François Lyotard

* With computers, knowledge has become information that can be stored in databases, bought and sold.
* Knowledge is becoming externalized; it is no longer something that helps towards the development of minds.
* Knowledge is becoming disconnected from questions of truth; it becomes a commodity.
* Postmodernism is incredulity towards meta-narratives - overarching stories that put all of our knowledge into a single framework.
* In the computer age the question of knowledge is now more than ever a question of government, of power.
* Science does not have any justification in claiming to be a more legitimate form of knowledge than narrative.
* The principle of performativity (efficiency) merely subordinates science to capital.
* Postmodern science is about the generation of new ideas rather than the efficient application of existing knowledge.
* Modern art presents the fact that there is an unpresentable, while postmodern art attempts to present the unpresentable, creating the sublime.
