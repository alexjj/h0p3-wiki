title: 2020.12.20 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Fam

* Try To Take Over The World
* Hotdogs, banana, water
* Listening to [[dziggetai]], TimeSword3D, and [[Sphygmus]] play in the LLounge.
* Try To Take Over The World
* Sleep by 6
* Woke by 12:30
** Feeling refreshed. 
** Everyone seems fairly decent. Wife is reading her ass off, but doesn't maintain a list in her wiki. It's strictly a journal for her, I think.
* It's snowing again! I would not be surprised if this snow stayed with us for a long time.
** Roads are looking good so far. 
* Assigned writing task to sum their week up.
** They will have something prepared for us. My daughter knows she cannot win the argument. We'll see if she tries.
* Try To Take Over The World
* [[Family Time]] @ 3
** [[TTP]]s went fine.
*** Without school, this is far more relaxed.
** There was something from my offspring. That is better than nothing.
** Read The Wikis
* The Walk
** I really need shoes that work in the snow. I have my workboots, but I'd rather save those (because they are stupid expensive and not waterproof).
** Went up penis street. The architecture of the houses feel different here. I don't know how to describe it.
** We didn't get far before turning around. 
* The Meal
** Spicy noodles, kimchi, martinis
** [[MTG]]
*** Son's MUC vs Goblins, and I got crushed twice. Hard to beat FoW, ACall and turn 3/4 shackles/b2b. Drain did some good work for him too.
* Finished up the [[Family Log]] and I couldn't stay awake.
