title: 2020.04.29 - Prompted Introspection: Cold Weather

!! Write about the last time weather scared you.

[[2018.08.17 - Prompted Introspection: Scary Weather]] is accurate. The prompt isn't specific enough, so I'm going to take liberties here. Lately, I've been scared (there's fear in my anxiety) that it's too cold in CT to plant our [[Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden]] outdoors. We're just incubating indoors. The ground is ready. Temperatures have been volatile, and a single frost would be bad news bears for our little plants. I'm scared for the plants, but those plants are for the hoomins (of which I am one). I'm not shaking in my boots, and I remind myself that gardening is this back-up safety net supplementary supply of fresh veggies. Best case scenario, it's totally unnecessary, and my offspring have experienced cultivating a garden (seems important for appreciating human life).
