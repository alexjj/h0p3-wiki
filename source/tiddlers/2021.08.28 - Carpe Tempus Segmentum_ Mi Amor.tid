title: 2021.08.28 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Mi Amor

[[TTTOTW]]. Many conversations to reason about. Also, saw [[5c0ut]] and let him know what [[DeathOfRobinhood]] offered.<<ref "5">> [[TTTOTW]] + Footbath. Sleep by 6?

Woke at 2:30. [[TTTOTW]] and some [[canvassing]]. My offspring had not really begun in earnest. Assignments and justifications. My wife generously continues to take this responsibility from me. 

Shopping @ W-Entity. Just getting the cheap fresh goods. I am, of course, [[grateful]] that the heat reveals flesh. 

//The Walk// with mi amor. If I thought time flew with my offspring on a walk, it's 10x the speed with her. It is a jumble beyond memory now, more impression than reality sometimes. I almost only remember feelings, not thoughts. I don't even know what to say about that, but I'm somehow at ease with it. It just is.<<ref "a">> I do remember this though: she thought about what randos (except for one [[anon]], I believe we have met at least three times now) have said to me today, with a bit of a laugh, and told me that it can be difficult to pierce through some layers of my sarcasm if you don't know me (I do work to be as literal as I can in many case). We also thought about fiction, and the problem we have encountered.<<ref "s">>

Oil massage. Surprisingly, the walk did quite a bit of loosening.<<ref "h">> I still went hard on the places that never relax, though no bruises today. One time, she got a sunburn on her chest so bad that whenever she's physically worked hard, hot and sweaty, or sometimes feeling something very strongly, it turns dark red again (it looks a bit like bruising). Though I don't understand it, it's always a sign of something to me. Anyway, apparently a massage can activate it with her (at least half the time). I don't know why she doesn't like the material of the table, but I'm quite happy to use my blanket, as usual. 

//Inform the Jabba!// 

Meditation. Shower of the gods! We grabbed leftovers and tried watching a bunch of new shows, but they all flopped. Maybe it was a mood, but I don't think so. I've met many people who no longer watched many highly produced videos, and I think we have become these people. I'm pretty sure we will be out of the loop, no longer participating in a key cluster of conversations, and that makes me sad. I don't know the costs of lacking these references. In any case, I'm drawn back to the problem of fiction. Only the written word seems to be able to do it well enough, if at all.

It was a super chill day. We needed it. Fell asleep at 9? Woke at 11:45. 

Watermelon! I'm getting every bit I can in while I can. She tells me the season is coming to an end, and soon I will have to wait. [[TTTOTW]].

<<footnotes "h" "Her migraines have subsided. She still has to speak with her doctor though. Another month before we can see the neurologist, but I think DD evidence and displaying an understanding of at least some of the process may be useful.">>
