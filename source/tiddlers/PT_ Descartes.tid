; 1596-1650; Ren√© Descartes

* In mathematics we start from indubitable premises and deduce irrefutable conclusions 
* To gain knowledge, we should start from indubitable premises as in mathematics
* Sensual observations cannot be trusted, as they receive us frequently
* I cannot be absolutely sure at any moment that I am not being deceived by an evil demon controlling my senses.
* The only thing I can be sure of is that I am having the experiences that I am having
* I may not know my own nature or the nature of things, but that I exist is indubitable
* I can think of a perfect being even though I am imperfect; therefore it (God) exists.
* If I think carefully, I can be certain of my conclusions, because God will not deceive me.
* There are two kinds of substance, interacting with each other: mind (which I am as a conscious being) and matter.
* Unlike the body, the mind is indivisible; it is a unified and integral thing, and willing, sensing, understanding, etc. are not parts of it.
* Animals can act 'in accordance with' rules of reason, but they do not really act 'for' these reasons; they cannot apply these principles to novel circumstances
* The best explanation for the absence of speech in animals is the absence of thought; animals are nothing but mindless machines or automata
