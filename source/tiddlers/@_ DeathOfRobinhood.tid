Yo! `/salute`. Still blind AF in new territory, but my conscience is clear. 

I look forward to it. So far, no seeders. Let me know if you want me to distribute through other means as well, please.

Hi [[h0p3]], hope your eyes and conscience are clear these days.

Our show is set to air in January. I'm using Resilio to host the episodes and some promotional material and random files. I don't know how useful or intelligible you'll find any thing in there, but it's free for you and your fam to look at if you like :)

> quaint Little House on the Praire points

How do I spend these points? I want big prizes.

> windshield wiper. On a sunny day

XD. 

> the former is being resurrected

Why is it being resurrected? Of what little I have seen, most resurrections fail to my eyes. Probably hard to do well. Oversimplifyingly, I could imagine it's like trying to extend and match missing pieces on a custom wood stairwell (but, far more intense). 

> No uncharted territory until maybe the new year, but that's fine.

Already so much uncharted territory as it is anyway. 

> The older I get, the more tiring I find self-promotion, and the less energy I want to invest in that particular aspect of my kuhrear.

`/nod`. Yup. Prolly got bigger fish to fry too. I can't say non-organic networking isn't a battle worth fighting at some point in your shoes.

> know any webrings that would have me?

I don't know what webrings (not straightforward to define either, imho) are worth participating in. Maybe there's an important difference between a set'n'forget portfolio site and one that you'd be updating constantly too. Also, if animation is a young-person's game out there, I would be surprised if webrings were the path of least professional resistance (but I don't know the crowd).

> As husbands, we often have the easy part, sir. This joke is over the line (but you get what you get from me, complete retardation): I hope your dishwasher gets repaired soon. (You are both free to punch me for this joke, and I get to do your dishes).

Scrub out that grime, buddy!

> We're the sort of homebodies who are easily overwhelmed by novelty and stimulation. Even what may appear mundane to you will be highly novel to us. We don't visit many new places often. When we do, we use or think about using our computers. We live on our machines (I know you are surprised :P). For quite a bit of my life, if I was to be anywhere for more than a day, I'd bring my desktop with me (laptops will do us). We like food (not picky, we just like food :P). Happy to be a fly on the wall, walk around (I don't know if it is common to hold hands walking down the street together), just live in your life, meet folks that matter to you. Beyond the record levels of autism you'll be housing (get your geiger counter out), I'd rather we add zero pressure to anything. I want us to see through your eyes. We're happy to do whatever fits best. What can we bring?

Bring your tech, we'll do our best to accommodate and get you set up. Might have to get a couple of extra power bars, hah.

Montreal's a very walkable city. Holding hands while walking may even net you some quaint Little House on the Praire points. You really don't have to worry about looking 'weird' though; I promise you, you won't compete.

> /salute. She's cute AF, dude. What do her cries sound like? My son's sounded like a quiet bleating alien.

She often sounds like a windshield wiper. On a sunny day, maybe?

> If you can talk about then, what projects?

Nothing too exciting; season 2s for a couple of prior projects ([[REDACTED]], and [[REDACTED]]), the former is being resurrected from 2017. I won't have a great deal of creative say in the first one, but will get a chance to flex creatively for the second which should be fun. No uncharted territory until maybe the new year, but that's fine.

> Why'd you replace it? It's good.

It wasn't easy to update, but I didn't replace it with anything better (or anything at all). The older I get, the more tiring I find self-promotion, and the less energy I want to invest in that particular aspect of my kuhrear. But maybe I'm just getting lazy and skill-learning-averse. I'b be happy to just slap something simple together with a repeating tile background and a hit counter and call it a day (know any webrings that would have me?).

'':P''. Living the dream, sir. 

How long do you anticipate it will take Selah to heal? 

Will get my passport [[renewed|https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/have-passport/renew.html]] asap. I should be able to come up as soon as I have it. Current estimate, it may be 18 weeks before I have it. If you got room on the floor for 3 of us (we have our sleeping bags), [[j3d1h]] and [[1uxb0x]] can come (but, I need to acquire new passports for them - I applied for my son's when he was just a few days old).

Don't be shy with pictures (I am unfloodable). She's gonna look different by the time I get to hold her! How's she eating and sleeping? 

Everything set on the job front? 

<br>

; 2021.07.05 - @h0p3

Dad-life's a breeze, man. I'm coastin'.

Mom-life on the other hand... Selah got a bad case of tendonitis before she gave birth, and ended up with a really bad tear on the day of. She was a one-armed, unable-to-sit-down maternal force of nature, and I am humbled.

Baby is knocking it out of the park too. She poops like she's been doing it all her life. I think she's a muscley one too. She was lifting her head up first week and beats me at arm wrestling regularly.

People have been kind in bringing us food, and my in-laws come about 3 times a week to help, so we are well aided.

Can't wait for you to meet her. And Selah. And me.

<br>

; 2021.07.05 - @DeathOfRobinhood

Not a problem, sir. If yall could use any more, lemme know. How's dad-life going?

<br>

; 2021.07.05 - @h0p3: Thank you!

I just saw these. That's very thoughtful of you!

Thank you. It's moving. Not that this matters, but I am a fan of that style of painting: it triggers or enhances open-eye hallucinations for me. Helluva story too. We sat and watched it together. Daayaammmn. 

We can all relate to the lost cowboy comet whizzing by the sun out of control. Aliens, man. I don't belong here. Do any of us? Lol. I know what it's like to be and to feel not well-suited to a context, lawd; and, like that character, I know what it's like to write so foolishly about what I do not understand. That is me in the world and with [[others]] so often. Whether I know it or not, I am too often a fish out of water, the wrong man for the job, remarkably delusional, bringing my penis-shaped kazoo to the orchestra, and failing to find the prayed for intersection between where I feel I belong and where I actually belong (closing the dream gap). Sometimes I aim to be a clowny menace to //Rick & Morty//'s nihilism while respecting just how meaningless or purposeless life can feel in too many contexts. It's sad, but I think there's [[hope]] in this [[vidya]]. I am not alone. I belong with that person too. May there always be room for one more.

Things that leap out: Arendt's concept of the will; Disney's chunking of the will; as an animator, assuming non-propositional processes when thinking motive and sequencing out actions. 

I haven't watched Quinn's Body Beautiful yet, but will get to that to see what I'm missing.

I'm recently revisiting Donald Crafton's [[concepts|https://www.academia.edu/34912973/Animes_Actors_Constituting_Self-hood_through_Embodied_and_Figurative_Performance_in_Animation]] of embodied and figurative performances, and Herhuth's article will, I hope, help inform how I think about performing in embodied mode at least. 

<br>

; 2020.02.21 - @DeathOfRobinhood

That is a great intersection for us! This is good work too. Thank you. What leaps out for you here?

Thanks for staying up to compose that entry on Moral Luck. I'm sorry for worrying you. The news I received does not affect me directly, but people for whom I want better things. I could feel my heart beating in my chest all night, but I'm to blame. My reasoning is childish and I appreciate your instruction.

If you have a collection of quotes sitting around somewhere, I would like to read them; you know how to pick out the [[salience]]. There is something special about [[antipleonasm]]s. I would argue, in your shoes, that Christ is something like an antipleonasm (in terms of moral responsibility only the //finite// aspect of the [[fff]] is applicable). I'm extremely curious about your numinous/voluminous claim. I stand on quicksand trying to reason about how the transcendent becomes immanent to any [[dok]]. When it comes to [[faith]], one of our strongest disagreements will be about the conditions of freedom; that may also be worth our attention.

<br>

; 2019.07.12 - @h0p3

Yes, I got stuck on that Booth quote and thought the possibility that someone somewhere might benefit from a visit from some reddit nomad was worth the time to it took to share it.

Don't worry about taking a lot of time to respond, or even about making your responses to me especially sophisticated. I'm still working of my response to the other half of our earlier exchange (the 'God email') and am coming around to the idea that the numinous does not necessarily reside in the voluminous :)

I am a fan of [[that quote|https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/c9pafd/william_booth_on_loneliness/]]. I take it you've been reading //Friendship at the Margins//. The letter is taking forever, btw. I'm sorry.
