[07:27:57] lg.: Good morning. :)
[07:28:18] h0p3: I can appreciate not preferring it. 
[07:29:40] h0p3: Sometimes it is the only option available. Otherwise, I'd rather have face-to-face discussions in plenty of contexts.
[07:31:03] h0p3: Why aren't you a fan of it?

Because I am not supposed to exist.
    What makes you say that ?

"Leave no trace."
    That seems fairly difficult to do in the ultimate analysis.

    It's all relative.
        To something, yes.

    To one another in this case.
        At least that. 

Etherpad is an interesting place to have a discussion. We use it in [[Family Time]]. And, I've used it with a few others. I like how we get to see our thought process evolve in real-time.

Exactly. :)

[[ASK]] says she would give you a big old hug from what she has already seen.

Do you save the "log"?
    Yes.
    Would not saving this one make you feel bad?
        Why should it?
    
        It's just the polite thing to ask.
            I appreciate that this is a social convention. 

We use Etherpad when we need to mix our identities.5
    I cannot say I have enough practice in that. I do my best. I can't even roleplay correctly, so there may be something there I can't do well enough as an autistic person. 
        I'm colorblind, btw. But, I like how the colors seems to flash from different to similar. I will still remember who said each line, even years from now.

    Who do you use Etherpad with in this manner?

    Oh, it's a long story. Now I'm trying to find a solution. 
        `/nod`. A solution to what?

        To your... problem.
        You seem very good at knowing but you suck at not knowing.
            That is an interesting claim no doubt. I can't say I know what that means well enough. It's a classic phrase, almost.
            The claim that it's a problem. Yes.
    
        Are you familiar with the matrix protocol?
            Slightly. Can't say I'm a huge fan of it. [[2021.11.17 - HN Log: Arathorn & P2P Matrix]].

It can be "hacked" in interesting ways.
    Tell me about it. I'm surprised if you mean it is insecure, but I assume you mean it can be used in an unforeseen or unintended way that would still be interesting or delightful to most people interested in the protocol.

I'm not sure about delightful. One can use one account for many identities.
    In a sense, I'm most interested in multiple accounts for one logical identity.
I'm interested in both.
    Yeah, I can see the value in both. I think it may be the case that something like [[anonymity]] can only fully arise from tooling that sits underneath that layer. I am, of course, [[grateful]] to speak with [[anon]]s.

I'm interested in "relative anonymity"
    It does come in [[dok]]. I prefer [[anonymity]] for reading more than writing. Pseudonymity seems like a reasonable halfway point. I still have to build trust with a [[name]] at some level (even if only a key).

Long-term anonymity is impossible.
    In almost all cases, sustained communications are not possible there, aye. I agree. We can only do our best, push the edges, build what fortresses we can.

Chromium switchup*. Deluminate works better for Etherpad.

We can't continue before we fix a few issues.
    `/nod`. Alright. 
No one else should know about me.
    I can't help you there. There are at least 3 people in my life who will always be able to know about you. [[Contact]] lays out the lines reasonably well, I think. There are ways to have more [[anonymous]] comms with me than you have right now.
        You may summon me from 4chan. I keep RSS keyword searches up for some words. And, this provides an element of a mixnet for you as well (something like having a lot of people in this Etherpad at the same time).

I know. Someday I will be able to talk to you.
    Have you ever asked me about using the Matrix Protocol before? 
Yes.
It was me.
    It is a pleasure to meet you again then. 

:)

Something abnormally interesting is going to happen soon. Soon enough.

I need to find a way to talk to you about it.

Why does your family need to have access to your mind?
    Because they own me (I'm talking Hohfeldian moral rights structures here), as does Humanity, to some non-trivial [[dok]]. I do not have a moral right to my [[privacy]] against all, and I never will totally.
This makes you safe.
    In some respects, yes. And, //that// is a long story. =D.

It also makes the world safe against you. I can't say the same about myself.
    A fair claim! I appreciate that too. Well, you have my trust to some non-trivial [[dok]]. I [[hope]] to be a [[good]] listener.
    Nobody is a good listener... :(
        I'm sorry. 
        What makes for a good listener?
        I speak through other people. Literally.
            You have my attention! 
            I think this is another reason that I speak in the open as I do. And, I have been told I am sometimes skilled in using other people's words to say what I want them to say.
        Some of them are very difficul to respect.
            What kind of respect? [[2014.02.17 - Bare Metal Recognition and Appraisal Respect]]
                The kind of respect that takes them seriously. Their structure and their purposes.
                    What does it mean to take someone seriously [[irwartfrr]]?
                        The "in the right ways, at the right times, and for the right reasons," is the hard part, I realize. And, it cannot be up to me in the end.
                        Nothing is up to you in the end. But this will change.
                            There are things that are up to me, but I agree I tend to have little influence. 
    Yet. (There's always h0p3.) :)
        <3. 
            [[ASK]] says she would "punch a puppy for you." (she wouldn't punch a puppy, but it's just a mood/feel)


Maybe someday you will accept to take care of me.
    I'm would read everything you write. Why not have a pseudonymous site where you build out a [[PSM]]? 
        Let me also say, I know it sucks not to have people listen to you. 

People always listen to me. My problem is that they don't listen to each other.
    Perhaps they aren't listening to you well enough?
The ones I talk to do. *You* don't.

Why would somone need so much anonymity (microanonymity)?
    I like that term "microanonymity." There seem to be plenty of reasons that we need [[dok]] of [[anonymity]] in the world.
The implied question is, do you think you (are beginning to) understand me?
    I cannot say I do. I'm doing my best though.
    I don't doubt this.
    The editing is very slow because of the virtualizer.
        What's being virtualized?
            Whonix.
                Whonix is amazing! I wish more people used it. I tried Qubes, but I never seem to have enough compute to make it work for me.

⦗...a very long wait, as [[ASK]] and I chat, take a piss, get some chips for the morning⦘
