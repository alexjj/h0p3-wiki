`I don't think most people would guess that she's autistic. It does present differently in females.`
so I've been / am curious about this - has k0sh3k been officially diagnosed / tested / given the stamp of autistic approval by our corporate healthcare system?

there's a little sliver of "huh; maybe?" wonder about whether I fall on the spectrum since I read one long-ish article about how it presents differently in women. Though I don't foresee myself ever getting tested, I have no idea how to tease apart the influence of my upbringing from whatever might be innate, and if it runs in families & has a higher occurrence in men, my younger brother is perfectly normal. I also have the concern that I might be hunting for answers "why" that are ultimately a distraction from living with / learning from / growing with myself, which is a process that doesn't need an answer to that "why" (I don't think, atm).

(I chose "I don't wish to answer" on the "voluntary disability disclosure" thing when I applied for a job today, b/c let's seeeee they listed depression and anxiety .. but I haven't been officially diagnozed ... but yup, it's a thing for me .. so fuck it I'm not answering. which is a new choice on that question for me compared to previous job applications of mine.)
[6:16 PM] h0p3: She has not been officially diagnosed.
[6:17 PM] h0p3: Hi, k0sh3k chatting. :slight_smile:
[6:18 PM] h0p3: My mom was told by a couple different doctors that I had ADHD and/or autism, but that - given the climate of the times when I was a kid - I shouldn't be officially diagnosed as long as I could "pass" as "normal." She took their advice and worked with me to develop social adaptations that made life easier - although everyone knew I was a little different.
[6:20 PM] h0p3: So, we always knew I was ADHD and autistic, but it was never publicly or officially acknowledged.
[6:21 PM] robotic_scarab: ah, I see!
[6:22 PM] robotic_scarab: that's very interesting, thank you for the background :)
[6:24 PM] h0p3: *h0p3 again. k0sh3k sent a friend request. Yeah, I wouldn't put it on there. I am convinced it will be held against you in at least some cases (nearly impossible to enforce the law there).
[6:26 PM] robotic_scarab: friend request accepted! :agreement:
[6:27 PM] robotic_scarab: ah, yeah, in this case it's choosing to say "withholding answer" vs. always answering "nothing to disclose" previously. but yeah. I don't disagree with your paranoia/concern here
