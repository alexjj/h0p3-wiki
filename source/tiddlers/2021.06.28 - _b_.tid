You have the right to work but for the work's sake only; you have no right to the fruits of work. Desire for the fruits of work must never be your motive in working.

I [[like]] it. A lot. Admittedly, it's still too ambiguous, but this is edging right on Saint Kant's claim. Instrumentality for the sake of [[good]]will is the only justification for wielding autonomy.

Beyond possible closure, I think one of the benefits of continuing the conversation without one's interlocutor is that one still has the chance to argue in [[good]] [[faith]]. With a sufficiently dynamic and accurate model, you've got a representation of [[the other]] that is non-trivial, even if incomplete or not nearly as significant as the real thing. And, it enables the door to stay open and progress to be made.

My ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 is my ~~evil~~ mentally-ill word bukkake dumpsterpit (right in the eyes, straight to the brain). It is LiveJournal taken the Nth degree. [[We do not talk about it|Fight Club]]. Pornography. I agree that I change the nature of the conversation about it when I join. There are many costs to being public on either end.

What's the most we can hope to squeeze out of performance limitations of homomorphic encryption? I'm not convinced we'll see a radical speedup at this point. I hope we do. Surely, there are very special places where it will be a magic lynchpin.

Perhaps it's too obvious to say it, but I'm going to say it: we should not conflate our desires to be or have something with our beliefs that we are or have that thing.

People ask me how I explain [[The Good]]. It's very simple really. Whenever someone asks me what a [[good]]-related term means, I simply relate it to another [[good]]-related term. When they ask me what that means, I continue making references to increasingly obscure concpets int he most convoluted manner possible. Eventually, I completely abandon all semblance of intelligibility. i abandon punctation my explanations cese 2 b coherently constructed & functioning statements becoming a desert stalked only by pretenteniousnsess i subvert the model to create territory with no maps. Another day, another scholar.

I agree that some kinds of genetic virality are handicapped by the negative side effects of incest, whereas many aspects of memetics, ideology, and structures of capitalism can self-duplicate with far more efficiency without becoming as malignantly inbred or stale as quickly. These too will fall to contradiction and negation though.
