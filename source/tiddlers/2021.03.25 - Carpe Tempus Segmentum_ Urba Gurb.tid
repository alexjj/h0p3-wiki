title: 2021.03.25 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Urba Gurb

[[TTTOTW]] and spending quality time with [[ASmith]]. Salad, and my wife was awake. Ruh roh. Ugh. She's stressed, and I'm not sure about what (well, I know what, but not which). Won't take a sick day because she feels responsible for something she ought not, and she's not listening to reason. Maybe she is going to have her period soon. I don't know what to do, but I feel it. Put her to bed and kissed her goodnight.

```bash
yay -S bottom --noconfirm 
# Been a while since I burned all cores like that. I'm gettin lazy.
btm
# Very pretty. Think I still prefer iotop, htop, and my i3 statusbar. But, I'm not a poweruser of powerusers.
```

Someone asked me to lightly stalk them (lmao). Uh huh, yeah, okay, right. Proofs or GTFO. They dropped. `/salute`. The whole thing, me included, feels so disposable. Hard to find people who can write even a few sentences. I'm scared for the planet. Instant gratification addiction (based tho it seems), accepted default ghostathonic fishing culture, seas of bots, blackbox biased ELO ranking of surface features, radical privacy invasion, and the sheer amount of deception are not fun humps to overcome. If someone did this right (beyond the constant dark patterned monetization [could write a book on this one]), they'd push for folks to connect on different tools (make it simple to bootstrap right out of the bullshit); the IG signaling only appears to be like that, but it's not.

Continued work on the room. It's coming along. My room is always going to look industrial shitshop, but it can be organized. 

Bro was up way late, couldn't sleep. Nobody is sleeping well besides my son (good for him!). [[TTTOTW]], then work on the room, finding chargers. I have so many small little things, it's ridiculous. Up way late, chilled with my love for a bit, then bed. Tired AF.

Woke, 7 hours, head on fire, ruminating, and I think I'm feeling a difference without substances. Just going to keep rotatin'. Fireman Time! [[Morning Routine]], Hugs'n'bugs, same story as usual, though they are trying more in [[CTS]]. [[TTTOTW]].

Called [[JRE]] back. Jonathon's stay was odd, contentious, alcoholic is giving up alcohol for lent, narcissism is clear in the man, petit bourgeois signaling, boredom, a lack of empathy from what I can see. They did have some fun though, and he's being nice to his friend. Kids are mildly sick again. Bro is hunting for a maintenance position since work is drying up. Biodonor missed 3rd or 4th appointment now. Ugh. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Speaking with [[Jetstreak|https://www.reddit.com/user/Jetstreak101]] and [[Carvenstone|https://www.reddit.com/user/Carvenstone]]. `/wave`. Let us squirm togevuh. Talk to your retard, please. Let the healing begin. We must share our stupidity with each, love each other, and slit throats where necessary (step right up, ninja!).

//Skintime//. She's barely cogent, so exhausted. Snuggles, accidental beard tickles (then on purpose ones). She's so sleepy, she's giggling deliriously at retarded things (like me!). She verbally confirmed that she //can// take tomorrow off without feeling like it's wrong (some habits die so hard). 

Cleaned the plumbing out on the bathroom sink down into the basement pipes. Pipes below were good, but the sink catches too easily. It's a small bathroom and a small sink. Not sure what I can do about it, but I can keep cleaning it. Offspring finished up for me (I made more of a mess than I hoped I would), gracias. It runs smoothly now. Used two bristly brushes, metal chopstick, and the mechanical snake. Noticed that the connection point at the very top of the sink can leak and the PVC into the wall is not sturdy (neither are comforting).

[[Family Gathering]] was outstanding, chill, delicious (it was delicious for Meow too, as she insisted for 5 minutes of snuggles and licking my arm pit, clawing at my shirt on the table like it had catnip...she fully scented me and vv; I appreciate some of the retarded creatures that desire me). We had a fluffy meatloaf with a custom sauce (sorry, I don't know my sauces), and it do be hittin. We had salad that I hope my offspring will think about and a flavorful hash that had tomatoes in it (pleasant surprise). He didn't have the ingredients he wanted, and he just improvised. Again, it's ~~magic~~ skill and effort (offspring, are you listening?). Mocha, yum. My wife was ded at the table, and it was funny. I don't remember what we talked about. :P. The boys stayed at the table a while longer. My son led more of the conversation than usual, and I hope he continues.

Hugged folks and hit the sack. Out like a light.
