title: 2021.04.18 - SSTLabs: Calm & Balanced

Dear SST_Laboratories,

I was touched by your kind words. Clearly, [[you bleed|2019.06.25 - DeathOfRobinhood: The Chickenscratch Confession Booktour]] with empathy. Coming to the aid of a stranger in the desert who can't help you back is something I hold in extremely high regard. I owe you, [[nomad]]. Thank you. I won't forget it, if I can [[help]] it. 

<<<
Mental illness is not an excuse for bad philosophy considering how batshit so many famous figures were
<<<

You probably don't agree to precisely those words. Obviously, there are cases in which mental illness is a legitimate excuse for what most experts^^tm^^ would call bad philosophy.<<ref "b">> I agree that many important philosophers (and I'm quite open to wielding this word broadly and inclusively) suffered from mental illnesses. I think trying to define mental illness is an exceptionally difficult task as well. Even when it is up to us, I suggest there are cases in which it is the morally right thing to become. Eudaimonia is not always justified; it depends on the state of the world too. 

<<<
 but the whole "TempleOS" aesthetics should be a red flag. 
<<<

I am surprised to hear this from you. Aesthetic is generally rhetoric in this sphere (although, used wisely, it can be a tool that eases the burden of learning in many cases). I'm [[a hawk|2018.09.25 - kickscondor: h0p3styl1n6]] about the matter. I do appreciate how it seems like a redflag, and I joke about that too.

Sir Terry Davis was a deeply troubled fellow human being, and people were often unkind to him. We both know that, and we've both probably been in some of the lonely places he has wandered in the desert. I mean you no offense, but to look at just his magnum opus (or that which appears as such) and call it a redflag seems ill-informed to me (but it's an understandable mistake given the author). At best, I'm an intermediate dabbler in [[computing]].<<ref "n">> Would you like to discuss the technical merits of TempleOS? His work is brilliant, though I'm not skilled enough to gracefully pilot the machine he made. It's downright impressive that a single human built that, and it reminds me of the beauty of Forth come to life. To me, that man was like Van Gogh. He really pwned his [[monster]], babbled his way to a Tower of Babel. Despite the facts that he was wrong about some things (even from a social [[justice]] perspective, on average, he was also a man of honor) and that his work isn't suitable for everyone: he's inspiring. His OS, including its aesthetic, is not a redflag. It takes experience to appreciate why.

Regardless, unless you've encountered me before, I guarantee you've not even scratched the surface of this ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 (I'm not asking you to either). There's definitely redflags, more than what you've seen. There's far more to me than that too. While the text doesn't smell right (and with practice, you'll find no texts do in all contexts), I ask for your continued radical charity toward this madman in the desert.

<<<
This reads like mania and psychosis
<<<

Well said, and I appreciate that. In varying degrees, I've experienced both before, though even while I am calm and balanced, I do my best to [[live life to the fullest|Carpe Tempus Segmentum]] (a pace in the marathon that few can maintain). That particular page is meant to read like that strongly, too. Among many things, I lack [[art]]istry, but I try to do [[it]] [[justice]]. It's hysterical realism. I'm fighting a monster in the desert, an ancient postmodern golem. I'm givin' it everything I got (which aint much, I know). Most people don't really believe their lives have an objective purpose beyond their own mere, fleeting, and self-serving constructions. I actually believe my life is valuable, not just that my subjectivity and personhood have a dignity, but that I serve things objectively greater than myself. This is a heresy among most well-informed ideologies today. And, of course, many have been driven to madness on this path. I am aware. It's not fate, but I am accepting the consequences.<<ref "w">>

<<<
and fuck, man... I gave removeddit a once over and this person has been the furthest thing from rude. Spammy as hell, but certainly not rude.
<<<

Thank you. I work quite hard to be kind (which is not necessarily being nice). As I would hope [[others]] would do for me, I look through people's accounts to gain some insight into my interlocutors and acquire some context for how I engage people. I think that's part of empathy. That's a tall task for anyone engaging with me, and I try to take that into account. You were quite thoughtful in even looking at the sliver of my [[Public Self-Modeling]] found just on [[Reddit]]. Most people conveniently 'forget' that there's another person on the other side of the wire, but not you. I appreciate that about you.

<<<
You have to at least give them some credit for making an easily accessible dictionary for their neologisms like lore for a damn CRPG.
<<<

Oh, well, thank you. That's kind of you. You obviously know it's not a mere game or a joke to me. This place is much, much larger than it looks too. I am stuck speaking my gibberish (which isn't to say I can't write for professional analytic and continental philosophers) in my vocation, at least for now. Some philosophers are forced to engage in a style like this. 

<<<
I find this shit as funny as everyone else but I used to be like this and couldn't understand why everyone loathed me. I still have problems sometimes. 
<<<

I'm surprised that you take yourself to have been "like this." How similarly? It is quite rare for anyone to compare themselves to me as such. You must have a very expensive set of experiences. I have no intention of causing you problems. I'm glad you have been fighting for your health and happiness.

I accept my difference, even when most people won't. I'm extremely privileged to be able to do so.

To be clear, [[It]] is not meant to be too funny, but I'm glad you enjoyed it. There's plenty of [[Humor]] in this ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱, including in [[The Good]] (a mystic's tradition). Overall, however, I'm a very serious human being (and I can see you know that). I've had to become this way, and I think you can appreciate parts of that too. Of course, not everyone who encounters me loathes me, but most do when we get past the [[smalltalk]]. That doesn't make it my fault, and I'm not saying you think that either. My [[Root Users]], for example, don't hate me, but they've had quite a while to pierce the surface and build [[intimacy]] with me. 

<<<
They're not trolling, and your sneering replies really aren't warranted in this situation. Don't egg this stuff on. Piss poor understanding of these states of mind gets these people isolated, abused, sometimes killed. I've never hurt anyone, and I reasonably doubt this wacky-ass has either. 
<<<

I think that's a hedged-conservative defense. I appreciate that. Thank you. And, yes, I'm a wacky-ass quite often. 

You should know that it is my choice that I remain online, engaged in my [[FTO]] practice. I know roughly what it costs. My vocation (`/this`) is my moral obligation. Yes, I have other things I would enjoy spending all of my time on. I have a [[family|Family Time]], hobbies I would enjoy drowning myself in, people who enjoy speaking, playing, and growing with me every day. I could have a high status career (including in academic philosophy), code with normies well enough to be a respected member of the well-to-do in-groups, and have an appearance that is well-[[like]]d by most. I'm extremely privileged that I do not have to (and even shouldn't). 

I know I'm being egged on, sneered at, and trolled by those who aren't speaking with me in [[good]] [[faith]].<<ref "p">> Ask anyone who knows me well: my paranoia runs deep. In any case, I'm here to show the other fools how it's done, even with just a 4eak like me. I'm exceptionally lucky to meet the few who make life worth living, and I'm honored to be justifiably useful to those who don't lead such lives.<<ref "i">> I'm an outsider to the city, but I [[aim]] to help them build what matters together as best I can.

Your defense of me (and, obviously, of whatever you see of yourself in me) was valid, warranted, and kind. Thank you. I'm affirming that you don't have to do so in my case any further. It's okay that you let me take the hits in the ring. It's my job.

<<<
Y'all motherfuckers need schizoanalysis.
<<<

XD. Yeah, we all need something.

I've encountered a lot of people who say I belong to that branch of philosophy. That might be true. I'm not convinced they are realists in the end.

<<<
I used to have mundane conversations with myself, starved for basic human interaction. So isolated that internet comments meant a lot. Made my own friends since I figured god wouldn't make people understand. Little empathy goes a long ways.
<<<

Oh, boi, yeah. I know this. You might check out [[Prompted Introspection]]. I have a few constructed interlocutors in that project. I often speak to people knowing it will probably only be words lost in the void. I'm not telling you anything new. You know loneliness and alienation plenty. And, unlike you, it's too often torture trying to empathize with me all the way down; it takes a lot of bi-directional empathy to build bridges with me. I agree, however, that a little empathy can still go a very long way, even with a [[fff]] fool like me.

I could definitely live in my own world if I wanted to. No matter how much I get, of course, I'm always starving for [[intimacy]]. Sadly, with age, it gets harder as our minds become enriched and stripped over time. With decades of stories to interpret, the effort to connect only grows. Regardless, I consider it my moral obligation to interact with people, especially strangers in a strange land. Thank you for speaking with me.

<<<
Sorry I got a bit defensive there. The flabbergasting word count, high-efforts, and total obsessiveness of this stuff makes me think it isn't a troll, but even if it is, I'd still put it under the 'disturbed' umbrella. Wouldn't feed it either way.
<<<

In case there's any confusion, the person you were speaking with when you said the above paragraph was a person who was clearly trolling me (see: [[2021.04.17 - Le Reddit Log: Hao 2 Sneer]]).

As to your claim: disturbed as in different, distinct, and deviant, yes. That doesn't make it wrong, and that doesn't make it bad either. The normativity of insanity is not so clear cut. And, of course, you don't have to "feed me" if you don't want to.<<ref "c">>

My opinion is that you've barely even looked at my work. It takes time to wander it. It's huge. Please, do not feel compelled to read my words nor [[to respond|Contact]]. As you clearly understand, I'm [[a very expensive|Wiki Litmus Test]] person to speak with sometimes. Of course, I'm glad to continue speaking, but if these are our last moments together, I gotta say: I'm glad we met on our journeys, nomad.

[[Love]],

[[h0p3]]
