The pictures of nature in your recent link log are gorgeous
where did you find them?
https://libredd.it/img/vbd8wp3ozht71.jpg looks like TN tbh
Yeah, I can see TN there! =)
I have no idea where they came from. I just have thousands of tabs open. Sit on them, eventually come back to them (sometimes a few times).
Walkin hittin the spot out there?
Yeah!
It's a really beautiful area around here
whether it's seeing deer in the forest or herons on the lake, you get a little piece of nature living here
Noice. There a path around the lake to walk?
Image attached to message
yeah, there's a few small man-made lakes in the area
or maybe they're not man-made? unsure
Majestic creature
either way you can see this amazing fella quite a lot
we caught him hunting and feeding the other day
