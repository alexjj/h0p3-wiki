title: 2021.07.29 - Prompted Introspection: Approval From Difference Or Similarity

!! Do you feel a greater sense of satisfaction when you gain approval from people who are very similar to you, or very different from you?

I don't know, Samwise. I can say that empathizing with me isn't easy, and I think someone's approval that isn't based on empathy lacks a vital type of merit. How could they know what it means? There is a sense in which they must at least simulate (like a similarity) models of me to empathize in a way that I'll feel a sense of satisfaction from their approval, and that often requires non-trivial similarity. Without [[sharing]] some [[ends]], {[[Axioms]]}, references, and experiences, it's difficult to find it satisfactory at first glance. All this said, when I go to empathize with someone quite different from me and see what their approval means in their context (as best I can, obviously, I'm not skilled enough at this), I feel similar to them, and there's satisfaction to be had. This has enormous overlap with extrinsic motivation and [[The Golden Rule]]. I don't have a clean answer here. =/.
