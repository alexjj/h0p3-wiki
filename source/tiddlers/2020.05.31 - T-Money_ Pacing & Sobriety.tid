May 31 12:00am
Lol.
May 31 12:00am
Hopefully it will be up and ready soon. Hopefully it will be relaxing for you.
May 31 12:00am
One of those burdens and blessing. Blessed I can fix it. But a pain in the ass and little. Enjoyment in fixing it.
May 31 12:03am
But bought thr boat from a friend who bought it new. I new about the leak. He told. Me. But it got worse over the last two years.
May 31 12:04am
Can't complain on the $ I have invested vs the enjoyment we have had.
May 31 12:04am
U asleep?
May 31 2:30am
Nope
May 31 2:30am
Why not?
May 31 2:30am
Reading
May 31 2:30am
It's my job, haha
May 31 2:30am
Not to sleep?
May 31 2:31am
I am privileged to be able to sleep whenever I want to. I am lucky that I don't have to keep a schedule, though I tend to keep a nightowl's schedule. It helps that every member of my family is happy to see me sleep (though, they beg me to sleep more).
May 31 2:32am
I like to be fresh right when it's my turn to teach my offspring too, so it works out.
May 31 2:33am
If it makes you feel better my girls appricoatenwhennimnasleelm
May 31 2:33am
Fuck I'm drunk. Between the lines.
May 31 2:33am
Lol
May 31 2:33am
Trying to get my. Pc to connect. The phone is hard.
May 31 2:34am
At this point, I live in my living room. Sleep there, work there, walk in circles on this floor. I've left the house once this week, and I've probably only gone upstairs a dozen times. The life of a cloistered schizoid autist with Geschwind syndrome, lol. I'm a homebody hikikomori hermit.
May 31 2:35am
Phones are a bitch. I hate using mine.
May 31 2:36am
My stepfather use to pase every night. Drink, smoke, and pace. Every night.

May 31 2:38am
I never understood it. I tried it. It helped. Some.
May 31 2:38am
Pacing is absolutely necessary for me.
May 31 2:38am
Can't think without it in too many cases.
May 31 2:39am
You need a bigger second screen. Lol

May 31 2:39am
I live on my monster.

He is an genius according to doctors. I can't remember his number. But he is/was very weird. Now he is physically disabled.
May 31 2:40am
Register RN. Amazing cabinet maker. Amazing carpenter. Now has trouble walking up stair.
May 31 2:41am
I've build houses with him
May 31 2:41am
Id love to introduce you to. Not on the internet.
May 31 2:42am
He taught me alot. Good and bad.
May 31 2:42am
I'd be glad to meet him.
May 31 2:43am
he would genuinely give you a run for your money...
May 31 2:44am
That is exciting.
May 31 2:45am
My uncle-in-law is a savant. I require hours to understand even a sliver of what he does.
May 31 2:45am
It's my honor to meet the old weird ones.
May 31 2:45am
Blessed are the cracked, for the let the light shine in.
May 31 2:46am
i learned to "argue" from him. he was a good teacher. i also know when im in over my head. which i was many times with you.
May 31 2:46am
he has enough college credits to have a PHD. but instead he kept chaging his major. ended up after carpentry becoming a register nurse.
May 31 2:47am
Sounds like a renaissance man.
May 31 2:47am
As i have grown. i have seen many fallicies in his arguments. he was an amazing carpenter. but not a mechanic.
May 31 2:47am
Different beasts for sure.
May 31 2:48am
he had trouble hooking up RCA cables to the dish tv output to get sirus on the tv and the sterio.
May 31 2:48am

May 31 2:52am

And that was 15 years ago.
May 31 2:53am
Extremely good money for where you lived, I assume
May 31 2:53am

May 31 2:53am
im a selfish individual. but im honest.
May 31 2:53am
lol
May 31 2:54am
Well, it's a shame he's disabled. That has to be hard on him.
May 31 2:55am
I think I would fare better than most as long as I had use of my fingers and eyes.
May 31 2:55am
It would be easy to just veg out in front of the TV.
May 31 2:56am
again. i apologize for my self centered discussions with you.
May 31 2:57am
Lol, don't worry about it. I'm spend plenty of time speaking about my life.
May 31 2:57am
i tend to unload and not give you the same oppurtunity. it is unfair and not a good friend.
May 31 2:57am
i dont spend time speaking about my life.
May 31 2:58am
i am limited to 3 friends and my wife. you included.
May 31 2:58am
It's my honor to be your friend. Aint too many people who will speak with me at 2 in the morning.

I want to be stuffed and mounted, with my micro-penis retrofitted into a soap or sanitizer dispenser. Stick me standing up in the bathroom next to the sink. You jerk it, and I make you all clean. It puts the lotions on its skin. Feel the salvation running down your face!
