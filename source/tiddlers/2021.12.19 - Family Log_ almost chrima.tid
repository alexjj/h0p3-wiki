!! How has your health been this week?

* 1uxb0x
** My health was alright, but I wish I'd gotten more sleep.
* j3d1h
** Decent, waking up at more normal times now.
* k0sh3k
** Very, very stressed and then very, very not stressed! 
* h0p3
** Headache. The days have blended and blurred together (not necessarily a bad thing!), and things feels loose.  My stomach has been louder this week.
* ASK
**  My sleep is kind of chaotic, but even at it's worst it is survivable. Sporadic brain pain. A day of body aches. I'm pretty good overall.

!! What was interesting to you last week?

*I passed Greek, and didn't even have to take my final, yay! 
*I have a desk! It was far too much drama, and not over yet...but I have a desk!
* Found a grill. The sort that cooks. The sort that is made of metal.*
* Grandma Frenchfries is dead! Yus. Life is good.
* [[5c0ut]] is in NYC for a month! Kinda crazy.
* Someone seriously tried to phish me, and I do not understand why. Don't think I was targeted (doesn't feel personal enough, and there are much better approaches if so).
* I found it very interesting how being too frustrated to work anymore was remedied by a good walk and better than good conversation. Will need to test for long term viability.
* I fixed the toilet.
---
!! Outside of our immediate family, who did we have significant social interactions with? 

* TG, cancelling my final, that was pretty significant! CSA, on her way to surgery. EC.
* [[MJos]], [[Variety Creepy]], [[Root Users]]
* Smokey & Randy, Butter, WeakSeed, matoune, Tea, Melo, SpiderBee, Aero
** Get your tech back after a week of not, and then you decide to talk to erryone.
*** Nah, I just got a lot of compliments (and short conversations) on my art. :]
* Coal.

!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family (including ourselves)?

* 1uxb0x
** I'm happy that I've been reliably completing my work for at least a month now, I'm thinking this week will be a real test.
** Thank you for fixing the toilet! 
*** You did a great job from start to finish, including multiple trips to the store and dealing with customer service (not something you'd have felt comfortable doing even a year ago, imho). 
**** I was not comfortable, but I was not very uncomfortable.
** Thank you for putting air in my tires, too! 
** You are an excellent listener. You're also generous with your time, especially with random strangers. You help people who can't help you back. You do it for the right reasons too.
** Your self contained quiet thoughtfulness is something I enjoy being around, and I look forward to peeking behind it.
** Thanks for your RP planning feedback. :>
* j3d1h
** I'm still keeping up a pretty good pace for improving my art.
** Thank you for finishing the fire painting for Sunday school! I know you weren't excited about it, but you did it anyway, and it looked nice, and they appreciated it. It's a good thing. 
*** Your [[art]] has been bringing happiness to many people around you lately, strangers included.
**** SJ says thank you, too; she likes her Sekhmet!
** Thank you for trying out SS13 a little, even if you don't like it.
** your wry stabby humor sheds light on things that need to be seen. You have a gift for letting the air out of people and I truly hope I get to see it applied to people who both need and deserve it. The way you slammed that lemon juice was pretty awesome too.
** 
* k0sh3k
** I passed Greek! 
*** You did an excellent job this semester!
** You have tons of excellent, practical ideas for the library. I'm glad to see you being recognized for it. I hope they will listen carefully to you for decades to come.
** Thank you for the coffee :)
** Your positivity alloyed with your realism are obvious evidence of a thoughtful person that has been through hell and remained undefeated. I'm glad you made it. Much respect.
** Thanks for the off week.
* h0p3
** I [[like]] that [[The Den]] is a place that people can enjoy a few hours each day. It's coming along. I like that my space is for us.
** Thank you for helping me plan how to study - and for making sure I take breaks. You help keep me mentally sane(r?).
**Thank you, too, for teaching encouraging the kids to learn practical LifeTips, like fixing the toilet and returning items at stores and suchlike.
** The art you pick out has a ton of skill behind it, good eye. :]
** From the bottom of my heart, thank you for the difficult conversations. I love your willingness to get in there and gently kick me around. I love you. Thank you for being you. <3
** Thank you for teaching me how to-not just k'know, fix a toilet, but on how to fix a practical problem in an easy, reliable, and often effective manner.
* ASK
** Your definitions of "good" and "beautiful" are very complex and interesting.
** Your curiosity and courage to explore your computer is inspiring. You're doing an amazing job. 
** I appreciate your forthrightness in sharing what you like and what you don't - you are careful to protect your stability, and I'm glad you do!
** I enjoy speaking to you, and being able to ask simply how you slept by itself makes my day better.
** Even when my brain was creamed corn, I got new things done. Keep at it!
