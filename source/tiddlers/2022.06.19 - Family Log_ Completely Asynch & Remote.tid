!! How has your health been this week?

* 1uxb0x
** I have had great health as of late-esspecially my face-although sleep kinda had a heart attack at the end here.
* j3d1h
**awful sleep on saturday, otherwise pretty good.
* k0sh3k
** Mostly fine; slept well some nights and terrible others; one fairly big headache, either from stress or storm, idk.
* h0p3
** Sleep has been all sorts of fucked up. The paint for the tub was not good for me. I broke my toe too. 
* ASK
** Lots of improvement, I am tired all the time. I'm supposed to be. It's okay.

!! What was interesting to you last week?

*found out telly's new friends are a lot cooler than i thought.
* My week was fairly good. I never got my wiki working and I'm gonna have to do a massive roll-back for it (SERIOUSLY.) However, I did my work in my wiki and have the tiddlers on hand. The OneFile project is coming along nicely in my opinion, and it's gonna be fun learning how to make it an actual tool. Packing was subversively easy, though I got no sleep the night before (I think that I got plenty of rest though) I handled it...alright-actually bursting with energy. Dad was not so lucky about his sleep's results. I may be the only one to bring a laptop into the cabin of the car. All in all, pretty good.
* I'm still in contact with a friend, after having practically left video games, so that's a plus!
* I packed quite quickly and prepared-I didn't even have to push laundry like I thought I would!
** preparedly* Or whatever the word is I cannot google that right now.
* Conference presentations went very well! Also, made some really cool connections - and seeing DK again was awesome!
* Super weird not having [[k0sh3k]] in the house for most of the week.
* Oxford librarian suggesting internship for [[j3d1h]]'s gap year.
* Traveling to [[JRE]]'s. Seeing family I've not seen in a long time.
* Being away from [[ASK]] for a day already. Sucks.
* [[5c0ut]]'s been earning the trust of his co-workers and figuring out how to work with the owner's in an odd triangle.
* [[Letter]]writing.
* Nord4 works
* We went to a gamer store, and [[MTG]] has been on the brains.
* Waterbill was quite high.
* Never did make it to the food bank.
* Tub seems alright
* Watermelon!

!! Outside of our immediate family, who did we have significant social interactions with? 

*So many librarians!
*Telly & Moon, Astrophel, Alfred (my buddy), Butter, Comic & Myles, Cherry, WeakSeed, Beast/Ghost
* I talked to a human person. Almost enough to be regular, but not quite. 
* Avesta, [[The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum]], [[Killcoin]], [[Tzino]], [[anon]]s, [[NemoRevera]],

!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family (including ourselves)?

* 1uxb0x
** You did a great job on the tub, sir.
** You seem to be less stressed making decisions with strangers - like ordering food. I'm glad you're getting more comfortable with stressful social situations!
** Thank you for preparing a spot for me to do laundry, even though I didn't need it in the end.
**it's great to see you building magic decks more often, i'm excited to see what you end up with!
** Thank you for spending time with me. You are a lot of fun to be around. I am glad that you are more comfortable around me! 
* j3d1h
** You're doing a much better job working on the yard, and it's becoming efficient.
** You're a pleasant and effective travel companion.
** Thank you for being up and ready to go today, even though the rest of us were running late! Also, thank you for not being upset that you were up and ready to go and the rest of us were running late. :)
**i think i'm very good at entertaining myself when i have to.
** Thank you for helping me find the line on my humor. I'm sorry about all of the apologies. (Heh.) Thank you for letting me attempt to figure out where amusing becomes insulting.
** Thank you for finding my failures funny too. 
* k0sh3k
** There's a reason the other librarians listen to you: you're really good at your job (and good at teaching others how to do it too, which, ofc, is part of your vocation).
** You've become a skilled scheduler and planner. We're [[lucky]] you do too.
** Although several librarians came to talk to me about my presentations, the best one was a librarian who told me my presentation on MHFA had convinced her to get her certification, which she knew was a thing but never considered it relevant to her position. I'm glad to spread the message!
** Thank you for making sure I was prepared to leave
**i sorely missed being snarky with you. i'm very glad you're back. :)
** Thank you for trusting me to take care of your home while you are not in it. I will do my best to validate that trust. 
* h0p3
** Even when I don't trust or like people, I serve and love them the best I know how. 
** Thank you for driving me to and from the station; and for the super long hug when you picked me up. Thank you for talking with me every night while I was gone. Thank you for keeping us all on track, when I'm frazzled and there's a lot to do all at once. And thank you for getting the tub done!
** I enjoyed working on the tub with you.
**goblin is, if not a fun deck to play against, a fascinating exploration of mtg.
** Thank you for walking with me.
** Thank you for talking with me. Thank you for doing it over and over again until my brain stayed for the whole conversation. I'm sorry. 
** Thank you for holding my heart.
** Thank you for your patience.
** Thank you for trying. Even though it hurts. 
* ASK
** The seating in the back is wonderful. That was a great memory. I hope we get to do that again and again.
** I appreciate that you work to respect my [[privacy]].
** Planning for business with you is enjoyable. You're a skilled shopper too.
** Thank you for not giving up.
** Thank you for always letting me know what is and is not safe for me to eat! I very much appreciate it - especially after several days of having to calculate risks with every meal.
** Thank you for all of the treats! PS: I'ma miss you :P
*** I miss you too! Hugs! And don't worry about the laundry! I already noticed it!
**i don't usually appreciate sitting outside more than sitting inside, but you have created a space that's just enough of both, in my opinion. :D
** Good job stabilizing! Now climb!
