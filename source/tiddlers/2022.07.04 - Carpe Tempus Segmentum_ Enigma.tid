title: 2022.07.04 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Enigma

<<<
Sleep by 1?

Woke at 8. Gump. Fireman Time! Hugs'n'bugs. Brix. Everyone was up and busy.

[[TTTOTW]]. [[D2]] + //Borne// with my sympaticon. Found 2 skillers, 2 Lem, 4 socket monarch!, and other recipejunk and possible reagents.

[[JRE]] called. He's worried he's continuing to spiral further into depression. He's thinking about how he can serve his family. Noted that [[Rb]]'s family doesn't really hug or say "I love you," and he's resolved to change that. Made me laugh out loud, literally, with what he said at their last gathering. He's been talking with [[Lauraceae]] (who may be reviving her older support networks, `/thumbs-up`), and I'm glad to hear it. 

//Borne// @13:06:47. Trying to wait to play my clarinet. [[TTTOTW]].

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. //Inform the Men!// Meditation. Fell asleep. Went down to [[The Den]] for a dadnap. Woke at 3?

[[D2]] + //Born// @16:00:00. Twerk found Mal. Chicken and sauce with my sympaticon.

[[Family Time]], started downstairs, then went up. It was chill. [[Link Log]] provided by your bard seemed aight. 

[[D2]] while my sympaticon is learning about how to manually tattoo. Twerk found the second Sur! It's been a long time coming (years)! Combined. ''Enigma!'' CtA now fits, constructed perfect Spirit Monarch, swapped boots to tri-resist/rw/mf, and onto The Pits. Now I'm just missing one of the rarest items in the game and there's only perfecting left over. There probably aren't too many offline players to have made an Enigma. Kinda makes me sad to see there's not much more improvement to be made. Sadly, I think I still have hundreds of hours of LK farming to pick up the runes necessary to fully equip every single character with top gear. `/smh`. idk about that. Is one enough? 

//Skintime// and put mi amor to bed. I'm glad she has tomorrow off. 

Dialectics with my sympaticon. Lawd, I am a pain in the ass to argue with. 

A wild [[ratzzz]] appears...

[[5c0ut]] came down for a bit, then we came up to chill with him. [[ASK]] made some cheesy toast and lemonade (dope). We talked [[5c0ut]]'s new job, which is significantly better than his previous. He's not sure about what it will take to make the job he's interviewing for this week to be a better option (even though it pays 20-30k more). He likes the people, excepting the capitalist parts. `/nod`.

[[TTTOTW]].

//Borne// @20:20:16. Put my sympaticon to bed. Chillin' with [[ratzzz]]. Sleep by 2.

Woke at 8:45. Meditation. No dysanial Gump wamble today. Fireman Time! Brix. [[TTTOTW]].

[[D2]]. ~~The Druid~~ Dudu is the last to need patriarch. Equipped to the gills, another HOTO created. I have some pretty darn rare items to suit him (including a +2Dru/+20FCR crafted, the same for a circlet, and FCR/prismatic/str/stat rings), but he's still too much glass for my taste. Too easily one shot, as he often must cast point blank. He's a bad sorc (not a terrible one though). //Borne// @26:02:41.

//The Walk// with mi amor. Reggie invited us into his garden. Reggie's veggies: we were obligated to take them and listen to the man's story. `/nod`. We did our best to be useful to the man as he talked about his plans and yardwork. My responses were reduced to near vocables.<<ref "g">> Cut it short, got some dranks.

[[TTTOTW]]. 

Watered the [[garden]] with my sympaticon. They were thirsty. My sympaticon and I prepped dinner. We then hit a neighbor's giveaway garbage pile and scored ourselves a very heavy (though lean) table, solid wood. I think it would be well-suited being a work table downstairs. [[D2]] as my sympaticon fell asleep. [[TTTOTW]] 

Called to mi amor from her window. She's sunburned (though I don't think it's entirely from the walk, as she might lead you to believe: the woman was outside reading all day for the third day in a row). //Inform the Men!// 

[[TTTOTW]]. 20 of some of the poorest countries are experiencing over 30% inflation YoY. They get hit first. We'll see what happens to reserve currency status.

[[Family Gathering]] was delicious. 2 plates of pork, couscous, and gravy. Full with no crapulence. Watched the second to last episode of //House//.

Assignments. Encouraging mi amor to get to bed on time, seeing if she wants earplugs for the fireworks.

//Borne// + //Skintime// with my sympaticon.

[[D2]] + //Borne// @31:00:00. Dudu found Cham in a cowrun! Wtf? Ridiculous. Also, found a bunch of low end 4 socket bows all of the sudden. Harmony for everyone. ~~Even cooler, I found that if you wait for the CD on Valk to come back up, you keep the valk after weaponswap and removing item.~~ Nope. Eventually disappears during combat. Want to get to 89 so he can wear his ammy. 

Massage. [[TTTOTW]].
