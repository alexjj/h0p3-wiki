Hi h0p3,

I hope you are enjoying your Sabbath.

Are you familiar with Rekka and Devine's Arts & Science project?

They've been featured a few times on kickscondor's page.

The portal you might find the most accessible might be through Devine's personal wiki:
https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/home.html

I had the pleasure of working with Rekka a few years back, before she was called out to sea. I've followed her projects and continued to exchange news occasionally, but hadn't really looked into what Devine was up to until recently.

I bring him to your attention only because I see some potential overlap in your projects.

Is the time right?

Hope you are doing well,

Love you,
