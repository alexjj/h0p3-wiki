title: 2020.10.27 - Prompted Introspection: Line-Crossing

!! Are there any lines that you simply will not cross?

Yes. Obviously, I'm a habitual line-crosser, and I'm interested in the normativity of conventions. Some maxims cannot be universalized. For example, slaughtering a classroom of 4-year-olds for fun is morally wrong. I will not cross that line. That's not shocking; it's a pretty trivial claim in many respects. My point is that what matters most about the question is about justifying how to determine which lines one ought not cross, particularly the unintuitive ones.
