* She purposely woke me up being loud. I know it. SO mean! =)
* Woke at 1:30?
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Called [[JRE]]
* Offspring were given extra time to actually get their work done before we left.
* El Paseo Con Mijos
** My daughter dominated the conversation for the first half. My son and I joined in where we could. 
*** Girl has memetics and capitalism on the brain. Solid inferences. 
** Wore shoes today on advice of my life.
** Discussions of school were up and down.
*** My daughter got upset for being held accountable.
* Pizza
* Inform the Men!
* Meditation
* Shower of the gods!
* Checkins
* [[AIR]] called me up to talk about RBG dying. He was shook up.
* //Feels Good Man//
** Offspring adored this one. I had a lot of feels about the story and the storytellers.
* [[AIR]] called me back
** RBG thinking.
** Being-toward-death, the good things coming: his date!
*** Hiking, dinner, ghostbusters
** Sapiosexuality
** Gage is also in a relationship
** Rose of Jericho, Judith Butler
** Camping
* Watermelon
* Plugged my mic in for the possibility of speaking with [[chameleon]] (my phone isn't playing nice with Discord's audio it seems). 
* I got to VC with [[Sphygmus]] + [[dziggetai]]!
** While watching and listening, I bounced between nervous energy and being lost deep in thought. I'm glad they were chill about my absurd quietness and radical awkwardness (I make Abed look normal). 
** I have no idea how to describe the experience. For example, I've been reading [[Sphygmus]]'s words and thinking about her for a long time. It's surreal to hear her voice, to hear her laugh, to even watch her play on the screen.
** [[dziggetai]] could not be any kinder and hospitable. His voice is smooth, calm, and ultra clear. 
** Of course, it reminded me of the Red room qualia thought experiment. 
** Dancing, making art, programming, our brothers and [[games]].
** His quote was apt. It was almost like I could see through a version of her eyes for the evening.
** I'm not pointing to the fractal he made, but it reminded me of stereo speakers. 
** She had a good day at work. Got some chat and play time in.
** He stayed up extremely late to be with us. 
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 4?
