!! If you (and only you) could see one measurement or statistic over everyone's heads, what would you want it to indicate?

Gotdayum, Lady Melisandre, this is an interesting question. It's been a while since I've heard a great one from you. This is awfully similar in power-level to //Rick and Morty//'s S04E01 crystal device (as well as the hologram conscience as you will see), but I think it's possible to be far more useful to what matters most. And, as usual, it has the Jesus Rule in church thing going on (namely that half the time the correct answer is just mindlessly responding, "Jesus").

Take the idealization of The Moral Law particularized to my contexts embedded in a device (an embodiment of The CI) that measures, prioritizes, and predictively signals to me what I ought to want to know about and to do with each person, including whether or not and to what [[dok]] I need to be spending my resources on or with someone. Indicators of what about, how to approach, and information enabling me to maximize my odds of success of not just doing the right thing, but doing it wildly beyond what I could ever [[hope]] to accomplish on my own, would be amazing. I think I could make a much bigger difference with radical guidance.  

Could you imagine walking around saying the right handful of sentences to each person? That dude needs a random hug or money or whatever. Maybe I'd have symbols pop off my screen to know how I need to [[contact]] folks, and to be able to quickly do what needs to be done. I actually think someone using this device in a disciplined fashion could bring about Heaven on Earth. It's logically possible, even if otherwise not within my reach for so many reasons (presumably infinite computation). Obviously, it's just a thought experiment and a pleasant fiction. But, I am reminded again of why I [[hope]], and why I work on my vocation, [[WINTCIS]]. [[ridtyawtr]].
