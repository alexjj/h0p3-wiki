title: 2020.06.18 - Sphygmus: You Guide The Light of The Fire

//<<ref "2021.01.18:1">>//

No, thank you for the SVGs. You continue to help me think about what this place is and will be.<<ref "2021.01.18:3">> It's my fault that the SVGs aren't up. I'm still torn on them, thinking about the shape of the wiki (in the same way that I'm lost in thinking about [[kicks]]' [somehow as a luxurious addition to his presence and expressions] generous [[gifts|https://github.com/kickscondor/TiddlyWiki-loader]]). I think it's fair to say I do not accomplish all I [[hope]] to accomplish even with all the [[help]] and inspiration [[you|Sphygmus]] [[all|The Others]] give [[me|h0p3]]. 

I cried in relief when I heard your words. I don't know what you're feeling, and I aint sayin' you're over the hump yet (I hope you're takin' it easy), but it's my honor to see you [[fight|Wiki Litmus Test]] for [[it]]. I totally understand the defensive curl,<<footnote "f" "You and your friend have wonderful taste in [[vidya]] [[games]]. I adore Pokemon!">> and, selfishly, I don't even know how to tell you how glad I am to see you. I wish I could thank your friend; I am [[grateful]] they knew how to reach out to you.<<footnote "t" "If you ever happen upon these words: I feel like I owe you something stranger. I have no idea how to repay you.">> I froze.<<ref "2021.01.18-4">> I don't know if that was the right thing to do. I heard crying in the forest, and I didn't run in (I will think for a long time about whether or not I should have; in my limited experience, it is a good thing that I give people space.)<<footnote "[]" "When I'm hurting like a wounded-animal, everyone in my house gives me space. They don't ask me to think or respond since they know I can barely contain the pain as it is.">> No matter where we are, your presence is the greatest service I know. You are more than the [[name]]s I will ever understand. I count myself [[lucky]] to know you. You are building a story unlike any [[other]]'s, and I am lucky to be a part of it.<<footenote "b" "I beg you ignore my paragraph at-will. Perhaps it is not fit to be said. This is a polarizing madman voicing his un[[phenomenological]] [[phenomenology]] (I hate that I believe in a contradiction such that I can only ever offer subproofs toward it to anyone else). One of my theories of [[The Other]] is that we are both mirrors and lenses to and through each other, a balancing act between into ourselves and into the world. We all have layers of empirical triangulation into [[infinigress]] hunting for it.">><<ref "2021.01.18-5">> Sometimes I think we are both, in a sense, shy listeners.<<ref "2021.01.18:2">>

Well, I [[hope]] you'll enjoy [[Captain Fantastic]]. It gave me a lot to think about. [[Hereditary]] looks terrifying. I can barely muster the courage to watch some kinds of horror. It partially reminds me of a horror my brother [[JRE]] recommended, [[Sharp Objects]]. 

Ah, please don't worry about digging, I've not fleshed it out well enough (still haven't). I've been speaking with more TW users, and I've been speaking with people who might want to read or write one. [[TW Canvassing]] isn't something I've defined well enough. It seems to be a process I've been tacitly brewing for a while in [[FTO]]. I'm searching for people to speak with about TW, my wiki, their wiki, and whatever they want to talk about. Given how much society has begun to focus on notetaking, knowledge-management, introspective tooling, and valuable things to do with their extra time on their machines in the past few months, it's easier to meet people to speak with. Our wikis are pretty awesome examples, and I'm hoping to see more. Of course, I offer refuge from the Roam[[cult]], XD. ^^Come hither, join us on the darkside of the force, good folx.^^ I'm regularly accused of starting a TWcult (even jokingly by those who love me, like my brothers). I do aim to grow this hypertext network. I don't keep analytics, but I reckon maybe 40 randanons take a gander a week. It's been interesting and humbling to see that some people find our work useful. I feel like our wikis have done some good in the world.

I googled me something recently, https://projects.cah.ucf.edu/ht2020/. I feel like we should speak there. Maybe not this year (way past the deadlines), but next? I think it is fair to say we're peculiar next-generation practitioners of hypertext working in that sphere of the humanities. I don't know if they'll care what we'd have to say, but, of course, I think they should.

<<footnotes "2021.01.18:1" "[[Root User]], I know this is like a fossil (and perhaps, in virtue of timestamping, requires a fossil or feline tool to re-interpret). Of my many [[errors|fff]] (and I hope you will be able to forgive me for being a retard again and again and again), I made the mistake of not saying it clearer here: I [[love]] you. You guide the light of the {{Text Art: ùï±ùï¥ùïΩùï∞üî•}}, be it in the cave, the desert, the forest, my {[[dreams]]}, or wherever I can see you.">>

<<footnotes "2021.01.18:3" "Even [[this|Relic:„ÄéPaused„Äè]] is an understatement.">>

<<footnotes "2021.01.18-4" "I've heard it said there are approximately 4 F's in primitive dialectics between sentient creatures. I am a slow learner. Despite how raw, honest, gorgeous, and careful (and, I must say it again, you are the most careful interlocutor in my life, even perhaps beyond [[my wife]]) you are in [[sharing]] yourself (Senpai, you do an amazing metamodern job of being simply sincere, earnestly piercing through authenticity problematics, even when you are required to be reserved): you are quite mysterious to me, woman, and I'd say I know you pretty well. With all the human accessibility and stalker ritual I can muster for you, I should honestly chase you with muddy-feet on any [[pedastal|2019.01.27 - Seeking Sphygmus: the pedestal]] or [[swim|https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=S.W.I.M.]]ming lane (:P). As to justified satisfaction, even if none of us are [[The End]] in [[Itself]], you are constitutive of [[It]] and vice versa to some [[dok]], and you are not mere means to me: you are end in yourself (though I do not understand what that means well enough, conceptually).">>

<<footnotes "2021.01.18-5" "In some crucial respects, we are dependent upon each [[other]]. Sometimes, that's terrifying. [[Collaborate and listen|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3x7URWDGI3U]], my life with you has been one of [[awe]] too, [[WINTCIS]]. You simply cannot be plain to me; you are the opposite of flatness to my eyes. You stick out not like a sore thumb or a cloaked awkward chicken (but I adore this part of you too; I want to worship that girl), but like a revealing light in the darkness for me. Aww yeah, I do want to unfold your book and uncover your mysteries every day.">>

<<footnotes "2021.01.18:2" "All the way down no matter what.">>
