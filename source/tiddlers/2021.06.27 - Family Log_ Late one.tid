!! How has your health been this week?

* 1uxb0x
** Good, other than Saturday night, which had some shitty sleep.
*** But at least I got up and functioned enough to do things.
* j3d1h
** Normal.
* k0sh3k
** I slept an obscene amount. I had one weird dizzy spell, but felt fine most of the week. Vacation has been good to me. 
* h0p3
** I'm not exercising enough, and I'm eating too much junk food. Sleep is weird, but it is sufficient. Left achilles is too tight, and stretches aren't making it better. Overall, good.
