!! Write a paragraph summarizing each person's week:

* [[1uxb0x]]
** 1uxb0x
*** This was a week of consumption. I have been trying to speak more clearly as of late. I got a lot of sleep, but my sleep schedule is now shit. It was a very fun week, and it's sad that my sisters wasn't the same.
** j3d1h
*** I think you had a good week, but we didn't talk about it much. I saw you playing games now and then. Garry's Mod would be fun, so I'll probably play that with you soon enough. I hope you can get your sleep in without constant naps, since you seem to be struggling with that. 
** k0sh3k
*** You did get a lot of sleep and fun this week; I hope the break will help you feel good enough to jump back into school work this week. We had some really good, introspective talks, and you helped me get Thanksgiving dinner together - thank you! You spent a lot of time playing and learning Magic with your dad, and it looked like you guys had loads of fun with it. 
** h0p3
*** [[1uxb0x]] had a sick week, breh. It was off the hookchain, da bomb, phat, pure izzle, gucci, lit, goat, savage, the tits, and so forth and so on. Garry's Mod was his god, and he was flexing his skills, exploring mods of his own, etc. He lived on the youtubes too. There was some [[Magic]] and spurts of time he spent with his fam, but it was mostly autist's heaven from what I could tell. It was a nearly pressureless week for him, although it was a struggle getting his chores done (and he didn't practice his handwriting and some other requirements set out by his esteemed mother). His hair is looking better kept and curlier. He got serious napping in. He helped make our Thanksgiving meal. It was a great break for my dude.

* [[j3d1h]]
** 1uxb0x
*** Thank you for bringing sweets, such as pie up to me. It's sad that you didn't get to enjoy the break. I'm sorry to say this, but part of me feels like you have a short temper, at least with things that have been done before. Thank you for being extremely calm with me this week (and patient, especially during kitchen).
** j3d1h
*** This week has been pretty terrible, for a break. I felt incredibly bored (and tried to avoid filling that with food/youtubes/excessive sleep), mainly because none of my closest friends wanted to even talk to me. Smokey has started getting obsessed with DayZ - to his credit, though, he's already admitted that it's a phase. I enjoyed writing up the Cheshire Cat character analysis.. whatever it was...? And I'm thinking of doing that again.
** k0sh3k
*** You were a lot of help with Thanksgiving prep and dinner this week, and I hope you enjoyed it. I really liked your Cheshire Cat breakdown, and your art - you spent your mind-time well. I hope the break helps you jump back into your schoolwork. I'm glad you had time to talk to all your friends, too!
** h0p3
*** [[j3d1h]]'s break didn't feel much different from her previous few months of school it seems. She's anxious and depressed; she's feeling like she's supposed to get something done even though there wasn't much that had to be accomplished. She spoke with more people than usual, her chat status has rotated often, and [[j3d1h: Entity]] has been avoiding her somewhat (which is painful). She had significant thoughts and feelings about her remote Thanksgiving experiences with distant family (she actively participated more than most of us too). She has gone on walks during her break like a freak (Jesus Christ that is weird and surely bad for her health). She cooked with her mother quite a bit. She's feeling somewhat magic'd out, but vixivivo's fire may be growing in her. She's thought a few times about school with us this week, and that has been expensive. It is fascinating to see her have personal work in her wiki (currently set to cozy mode, even if only incidentally). Oh, good job on introducing quaternions in your interpretations of the Cheshire cat. She keeps looking older and older. I'm amazed by how thoughtful she is about others; she has a gift.

** 1uxb0x
*** Thank you for showing me "Into the woods," it was one of the few musicals I actually liked. You had a lot of energy this week. You should keep having ginger, it seems to help you. Thank you for baking pies, for the most part cooking the turkey, and cooking the bread.
** j3d1h
*** //Into the Woods// was fantastic, thank you for showing us! ~~Time to force all of my friends to watch it, too!~~ I think you're right - most mountains have been climbed many times, but deep sea diving sounds like a very new and alien experience. We sure do eat a lot of dessert. I would say that's living the life, though. I'm glad to see you much calmer (and occasionally hyper) this week. I hope the energy helps you for the next little while.
** k0sh3k
*** I really enjoyed cooking/baking, taking it slow over the course of vacation rather than trying to do it all on one day. I had fun walking the kids through cooking it all, too. VC with my family was not as painful as I expected! I watched a lot of shows and read a lot of books and spent a lot of QualityTime with h0p3 - it was an excellent vacation. I'm really looking forward to Advent this year, too!
** h0p3
*** [[k0sh3k]] had a great week, and she deserved a break. It was a staycation, and we all celebrated it (which is not to imply we deserved a break). I don't think she took it as easy as she could have (except cutting out all walks `/charlie-brown`), but that was up to her (and I respect her choices in all cases where I do, ofc). She expressed her [[love]] in making food with us (aside: she made a lot of cream of us [a more limited crowd, though Lady Melisandre is free to join this "us"] too), and it was delicious (muy). I got to see my wife in her element: reading with abandonment. She curled up with her garbage (including me and Meow [that fucker needs to get out of my lap, "bad kitty"]). She's got a big push coming up, and I [[hope]] we'll be able to chill again at the end of December.

** 1uxb0x
*** I want to learn MUC, MWC, and Death and Taxes among other things, I'm best with control. You've had a break, we've all had a break this week, it was very relaxing. I hope the new house won't have creaky floors, those are very annoying. Every week we have to say your disgusting, and we shall keep saying it every week.
** j3d1h
*** I do want to be better at Affinity, but that's not worth making another section of my internal cringe comp. You are a disgusting ape of a man (if you're even a man anymore). I'm glad you had the time to just melt this week. Unfortunately, I know far too much advice from you, so that prompt is mostly useless. You don't need to tell me more; I understand all. It sounds like everyone needs a break from 2020 (and I mean everyone).
** k0sh3k
*** I really enjoyed chilling with you this week! It was a lazy week, and you consistently went out of your way to make sure it stayed that way - keeping me away from work email, making sure I was having fun with baking, etc. It seemed like we spent most of the week while you were awake together - sometimes only in the same room, but often laying down together talking or watching shows. 
** h0p3
*** [[h0p3]] got a ton of XOXOs this week. It has been a calm before another storm: the move (but, it won't be too painful from the looks). He's not done a great job in his reading or his writing, but it was a week to fuck off. He watched enormous amounts of things on a screen, and he's feeling fatter, no doubt. Bliss continues to trail out of his life, but perhaps that might be in virtue of Non-stop Nutting November (can't wait for Destroy Dick December). [[MTG]] was fun too. It was a staycation, huzzah! =)
