title: 2020.07.10 - Sphygmus: Disney Exploration

"""
[12:29 AM] robotic_scarab: my god I don't understand a single thing from kicks' disney exploration but it's a jolly good time anyway XD
[12:31 AM] h0p3: I have a difficult time knowing when he's being serious with a political message sometimes. Lol.
[12:31 AM] h0p3: That bulletin board is dope.
[12:33 AM] h0p3: It reminds me a little bit of https://2ton.com.au/sshtalk/
[12:36 AM] robotic_scarab: my first sensation is that he is playing with masks, characters, acting
[12:37 AM] robotic_scarab: omg this interview
[12:40 AM] h0p3: I like how it literally grows out the screen. It's a map. I get the feeling that sidescrolling is considered unacceptable, and it shouldn't be.
[12:41 AM] robotic_scarab: I feel like I could ctrl+ to zoom out but at the same time that almost spoils it, seeing the whole thing at once
[12:41 AM] robotic_scarab: the screen is a viewfinder
[12:41 AM] robotic_scarab: I generally hate side-scrolling but I can accept it in this instance :sweat_smile:
[12:46 AM] h0p3: I'm still thinking about the quote mechanic here. I like the way it branches and feels out-of-order. It seems like an opportunity to automatically search the wiki for other instances of a quote to give more context. I have no idea how it should function or look though. I think it still has to be built by hand; there's too much tacit information embedded in how we refer.
[12:46 AM] robotic_scarab: hm, what quote mechanic?
[12:47 AM] robotic_scarab: hehe I'm still exploring
[12:47 AM] robotic_scarab: just said "oh, shit!" out loud when I scrolled up & discovered the messagebox leading to HT2020
[12:48 AM] robotic_scarab: now it's time to methodically scroll over every inch of the screen to make sure I didn't miss anything :laughter:
[12:48 AM] h0p3: XD
[12:50 AM] h0p3: Some of the messages are atomized down and attached as responses to blocks of other messages. I'm probably not thinking about it correctly either.
[12:52 AM] robotic_scarab: okay that logo is dope
[12:53 AM] robotic_scarab: i was ... going to go to bed
[12:53 AM] robotic_scarab: then i read your wiki before bed
[12:53 AM] robotic_scarab: and saw new kicks thing
[12:53 AM] robotic_scarab: then i went to kicks thing and now
[12:53 AM] robotic_scarab: oh no
[12:53 AM] robotic_scarab: where is bed
[12:54 AM] h0p3: The rabbithole awaits, lol
[12:54 AM] robotic_scarab: :psyduck:
[12:57 AM] robotic_scarab: daaaang
[12:57 AM] robotic_scarab: this was a lot of work
[12:58 AM] h0p3: Aye. The drop is huge.
[12:58 AM] robotic_scarab: he went all out in translating the footnotes - love those little hover bits, and the styles, and similarly with your acronyms and being able to click for the definition
[12:58 AM] h0p3: that poor bastard... :stuck_out_tongue:
[12:58 AM] robotic_scarab: I slightly wish the acronym links were styled differently than external links - I feel afraid of clicking on something and being jolted out of this space into a new tab
[12:59 AM] robotic_scarab: or worse yet, clicking on something and having it load in the same tab :scream:
[1:02 AM] robotic_scarab: "footnotes, reveal widgets, and link maps" -- I haven't clicked on the double-arrow quote thingy buttons yet (only one) but they seem very related to this footnote of yours
[1:03 AM] robotic_scarab: also I suppose I should be just dumping my reaction spam into the hypertext discord (that's what it's there for?) but I am also shy :sweat_smile:
[1:04 AM] h0p3: I will happily copy and paste with you. Lol.
[1:04 AM] h0p3: Going to answer the ghost questions.
[1:07 AM] robotic_scarab:
I donâ€™t have a desire to preserve myself or to catalog myself.
which is interesting, b/c in some sense the hypertext 2020 page he's built is also a monument to his words, preserving them -- they are after all seeds, and well - he is preserving them!
[1:10 AM] robotic_scarab: aaand half of my writing in here makes me cringe
[1:10 AM] robotic_scarab: eheh
[1:12 AM] h0p3:

Reminds me of: `view-source:https://www.kickscondor.com/stenos/winnie-lim/`
[1:27 AM] robotic_scarab: WHOA links that jump around in the flow!
[1:29 AM] h0p3: I want anchors in the bodies of tiddlers and storyrivers that allow me to jump. I'm looking at his hypertext thinking what I would like to implement.
[1:32 AM] robotic_scarab: the top level arrows don't fold back the way the middle level arrows do :C
[1:32 AM] robotic_scarab: i have no idea what a tiddlywiki that was more like this site would be like
[1:33 AM] robotic_scarab: wahhh kicks your site is broken :C
[1:34 AM] robotic_scarab: if you open the top double arrow link on the first chameleon quote, does it let you click the 2nd one on that same quote?
[1:34 AM] robotic_scarab: can't tell if it's my browser or his site
[1:35 AM] h0p3: It does, with overlap, but I can't control which block sits on top.
[1:35 AM] robotic_scarab: must be my browser then? :distress:
[1:36 AM] h0p3: Trying in another browser, and I can't actually get back to the button to close it out. It overlays the button.
[1:36 AM] robotic_scarab: that might be what i'm running into
[1:37 AM] h0p3: I think it's experimental enough that it isn't consistent across FF and Chrome.
[1:37 AM] robotic_scarab: mm, firefox here
[1:41 AM] robotic_scarab: I really wish I devoted more time & energy to actually reading & writing then, than I did :sweat_smile:
[2:16 AM] h0p3: There's never enough time in the day. I'd be willing to wager you read and write way, way more than the average person.
[3:19 PM] h0p3: I'm still thinking about what you said. I'm glad you write. Less important than why you write, your writing to yourself is often the most profound part of your writing to me. I don't know what to say about it, and I'm growing comfortable with that. I'm glad I get to listen.
