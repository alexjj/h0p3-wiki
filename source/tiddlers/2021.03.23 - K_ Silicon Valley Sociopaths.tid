I‚Äôm going to have two easy weeks of school followed by two intense weeks.
Mar 23 12:53pm
Hoping to hit the ground running now to mitigate that later haha
Mar 23 12:53pm
Yes, sir
Mar 23 2:09pm
Anything you are learning standing out to you as of late?
Mar 23 2:10pm
My day is going well enough. Rapidfire sensations the whole day.
Mar 23 2:11pm
Not really. It honestly feels like every class is having me do the exact same work, which is irritating haha
Mar 23 2:18pm
No super big papers yet either. It‚Äôs all lesson plans.
Mar 23 2:19pm
Nice nice. What do you plan to accomplish this week? :)
Mar 23 2:19pm
I know that feeling of monotony. I know my days aren't boring, but they blend so much together lately.
Mar 23 3:19pm
I need to continue finishing letters for [[FTO]], I'd like to continue working on the basement, regular house and dad stuff. Pushing hard in [[/b/]] and [[Link Log]] lately, and I'd like to continue that.
Mar 23 3:21pm
Creator of venmo mentioned me, so I'm thinkin about that.
Mar 23 3:22pm
I don't have much patience for the silicon valley sociopaths
Mar 23 3:22pm
I plan on fucking and cuddling, lol. That's the only constant. Do I get to be naked with her?
Mar 23 3:23pm

‚ù§Ô∏è
Hell yeah. We love to hear that.
Mar 23 3:34pm
Fall is going to be more fun for ya, I bet.
Mar 23 3:34pm
How did the venmo contact come about? üëÄ
Mar 23 3:34pm
Totally. Summer too tbh. Only taking two classes.
Mar 23 3:34pm
[[@: hypertext 2020]] was turned into a piece of art which inspired a platform built by kicks and another artist/dev, and somehow that reached the feller's eyes, and he was wanting to see the plaintext conversation (I kept the flatter, simpler, less gorgeous hypertext, but the more complete one).
Mar 23 3:37pm
Interesting indeed.
Mar 23 3:38pm
Wonder if that might go anywhere.
Mar 23 3:38pm
Doubt it. I'm mean to the silicon valley folks. Walking through his web presence, and we wouldn't be friends. I just don't want to fuck anything up for my friend kicks.
Mar 23 3:39pm
Makes sense. Haha
Mar 23 3:55pm
Good morning! Hope you are well. 

[[k0sh3k]] has asked via discord to let you know that she forgot her laptop so she won‚Äôt be on signal today. :)
Mar 25 10:05am
Yeah, gracias. She's not thinking straight today.
Mar 25 5:13pm
Girl didn't sleep well enough.
Mar 25 5:13pm
Asked her not to go into work today.
Mar 25 5:13pm
Determination is strong haha. [[L]]‚Äôs the same way though.
