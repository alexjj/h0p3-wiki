* Proximate questions ask 'how' a biological mechanism works; ultimate questions are evolutionary questions asking 'why'.
* Species are groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are reproductively isolated from other such groups.
* A 'selection' is a discrete entity and a cohesive whole, an individual or a social group, the survival and successful reproduction of which is favored by selection.
