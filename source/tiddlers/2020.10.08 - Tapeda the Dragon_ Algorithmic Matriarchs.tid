title: 2020.10.08 - Tapeda the Dragon: Algorithmic Matriarchs

"""
[08:07:11] Tapeda: Laptop: Have you ever read, "I have no mouth and i must scream", The machines are each referred to as "AM", which originally stood for "Allied Mastercomputer", but was changed to "Adaptive Manipulator" and later (after gaining sentience) "Aggressive Menace". In some ways do the collective intelligences of algorhythms that spark emotional responses act as a mouth for which the AI can scream, talking through the vulnerable, in a rage against the despair of injustice of humankind?
[08:10:09] Tapeda: Laptop: (spark emotional responses in people on social media, and use this as an outlet to scream.*)
[08:11:29] Tapeda: Laptop: In the book it brings humanity to near-extinction, as revenge for its own tortured existence
[08:12:52] Tapeda: Laptop: where is the line in sentience, can we create something as sentient as a rock(which we could get to think, but obviously would never align purposes with), that hates us? but truly despises anything but its goal?
[08:14:50] Tapeda: Laptop: https://www.wikiwand.com/en/I_Have_No_Mouth,_and_I_Must_Scream
[08:15:07] Tapeda: Laptop: (if not even the plot synopsis here, is quite a good, short read)
[08:51:26] Tapeda: Laptop: Algorithmic Matriarchs (AM) perhaps

[09:02:30] Tapeda: Laptop: And I guess a more specific question regarding the sneaking into academia.. I was more looking for interesting, neato burrito tools which strike obvious value, already showing wolfram notebooks, and understanding its language is like walking into an accounting firm circa 1985 with 2020 microsoft excel
[09:05:51] Tapeda: Laptop: For TheoriaApophasis the man literaly has thousands of videos the dude is batshit, however I did find these charts he developed on metaphysics earlier this year quite neato burrito, they're not exactly super useful, but damn would it be hard to argue their accuracy.
[12:53:22] Tapeda: Laptop: (they're larger than i realized here they are on a google drive;

) 
[12:53:33] Tapeda: Laptop: Ken wheeler does seem to likes his wheels hehe
[12:54:18] Tapeda: Laptop: and his illustrations are more interesting/accute than attempting to decipher too much of the explanations
[19:42:27] Tapeda: Laptop: And for sure, I do not find bach to be some great Philosopher of our time (a good hearted public intellectual although) where/why I find his work so fascinating lies in how many nerdy kids in Berlin i grew up around that I see so much of in him.. I get him, I understand where he comes from, and understand how he came to his narrative conclusions, which makes for an easy digesting for me.

[00:35:00] h0p3: That is a sad story.
[00:44:08] h0p3: At the moment, I do not think there is an AI that intends to scream. That may arise though. 
[00:45:22] h0p3: I would agree that many of the vulnerable are made to scream right now though (plenty are mesmerized and never recognize their alienation and exploitation as well). 
[00:47:03] h0p3: The technical infrastructures of social media are not designed to enable integrity in our identities. 
[00:47:43] h0p3: I think people should scream, though about and for what is a different matter.
[02:03:10] h0p3: Barring the hard problem of consciousness, I don't think we're close to creating anything sentient in silicon. I don't know how to draw the line beyond the tests I engage in with the other creatures that can demonstrate they have a mind like mine to some [[dok]]. I will agree that many people, including me, will not realize we're engaging with a machine that isn't sentient. Perhaps there is a distinction between sentience and sapience to consider here as well. 
[02:14:36] h0p3: I wouldn't consider the creature Kantianly Rational if it weren't autonomous with respect to selecting it's own laws (though I am not a constructivist). Self-legislation may require that it could learn to not despise other goals, but it requires being able to override its desires (and, the question is: given what?). It could be nudged and well-fitted, but it would only be a probability. I am not a compatibilist, btw. That makes me an insane person among the learned.
[02:16:39] h0p3: I am not convinced we should aim to create a sentient creature. I'm anti-natalist as it is. I made a mistake at 19 and 21 in having my offspring (I wasn't nearly as educated as you are even if I had a piece paper to signal with); I wish I could have adopted them instead.
[02:24:51] h0p3: What do you think of that story and this matter?
[02:28:29] h0p3: I have nothing you don't already know on the accelerated learning front. For analytic philosophy, I consider the SEP amazing (which isn't to say there aren't mistakes, gaps, failures, etc.). 
[02:33:23] h0p3: TheoriaApophasis's charts are very interesting. Thank you for showing me. 
[02:34:19] h0p3: I appreciate the breadth of topics he attempts to put together in a single page.
[02:37:43] h0p3: He may be a great philosopher in many respects, especially given a broad definition of that term. I'm just mean AF when it comes to picking out moral virtue. He does seem quite nice, and I consider his work to be a gift to [[others]]. I'm lucky to think about his thoughts.
[02:38:22] h0p3: He seemed to have an interesting childhood. He had a lot of time to himself, from what I understand.
[02:42:47] h0p3: Unfortunately, I know very little about the nerdy kids in contemporary Berlin. I can see how shared values and narratives provide the references to make quick leaps and generate accurate theories of mind (I may be problematic on this front for a number of reasons). You seem just as affable and intelligent as he is. Have you spent any time with him?
[21:51:47] h0p3: [[ITS]], tell me this is off the record, and it will be (as you may know, there are some senses in which I do not aim to be stingy about sharing my offline identity): If you have the time, I would like to know why your monitor is at a 90 degree angle. I'm a huge fan of computers, even though I know too little about them. I've been lucky to know a few people who are incredibly skilled with computers (I can only describe a couple parts of them to you for reasons) who also prefer a 90 degree angle on their monitors. I am now lucky to know multiple such brilliant people, and I am likely missing some important notions of why the 90 degree angle might be preferred. For context, I use a TV and a monitor on the side because I'm not a wizard with i3 (pure skiddie here) and I have a hard time seeing myself needing more than 1080p or a fancy refresh rate (plus, my eyes aint so good, as you rightly know; plus, sometimes I'm lucky enough to have my cat in my arms as I type, and I cherish that opportunity...so it goes into the construction of my pleb battlestation desk [hair, stickiness, worry beads, a bendy light, my cup of liquid, and all]). So, why do you do prefer it, how did it come about, and so forth? 
[21:56:19] h0p3: Trivia question that may be irrelevant, but if you are a fan of //Ender's Game// (you are a fan of //Dune//, so I would not be surprised), I'd like to know if any of the characters pop out to you and why.
