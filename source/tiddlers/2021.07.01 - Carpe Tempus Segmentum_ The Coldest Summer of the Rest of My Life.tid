title: 2021.07.01 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: The Coldest Summer of the Rest of My Life

Woke at 12:30. [[TTTOTW]]+LolVod.

Bridged chat channels with too many bots turns the [[S2NR]] down to shit. I'm in one IRC channel with [[ASmith]] that is important to me, but maybe half of lines are not relevant. Whackamole suppression. Also, he's been exceptionally active in piecing his offline and online life together lately.

Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Dried cherries, nuts, water. [[TTTOTW]]. Coffee, avocado, tomato. LolVod. Vapelyfe. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! Cleaning.

She's frustrated with getting lunch together today. She's slept, though the tide still sucks. She doesn't feel it valuable to use any automation for her special archiving project, and they are manually pushing through it very quickly. Her co-workers are competent and driven* at this aspect of library science, yet again; it's fucking glorious. I respect how they are not wasteful and select for [[salience]]. I like the way she understands her physical space in the library; asking herself what it's for like few can. It's her machine she uses (though never people as mere means) to serve the world. Talked about several inconsistencies in the //Lazarus// series. I hate that people and stories fall apart for me eventually. I adore her cat eyes, though I still can't watch her do it (far too painful). Thinking about the huge jump in food quality and quantity we've had since JC; I had mole, rice, and tortillas (god damn it's good to live in the city). Stole as many XOXOs as I could.

Woke offspring for the second time. My advice and thinking with them, as usual. You deliver the results for the lowest bar (your mother's) without my intervention, and I won't intervene. It's a choice, and it adds up in the end. Repeating myself. It's my job.

Instead of a walk with my offspring (heat, lawd), they spent an hour in [[The Den]] with me. She should get her wacom tablet up (I keep begging), and I'd like to see bullet-pointed divisions from him. Thinking about different options for having boxes downstairs. Not sure what we want yet. Working on our shit. Assignments.

Finally fell asleep at 1:30. Woke at 6. Fried. Deep Fried Big Brain Crispy Smooth. I saw her come in (missed messages, =/). That is a badass piece we have been missing for such a long-time in our own library. Silly //Skintime//, I'm incoherent. [[TTTOTW]]. Tried sleeping again, but it no work.

It finally rained some. I can feel the difference. Offspring did part of their work. I can feel the difference.

Coming down the stairs, I stepped on the tip of Rangas tail (I was holding stuff and it was dark). He was okay. He knew it was an accident, let me pet him immediately. Offered my food and then kitty krack and pets.

[[Family Gathering]] sans [[5c0ut]]@work. Tendies, melon, peas, hotsauce (once you eat enough of it, it counts as its own dish), wedges, water. We watched a couple more episodes of //Arrested Development//. I'll continue to pick cringe<<ref "c">> shows up for them. Get that feeling trained and something they've wrestled with. Gonna need it. Stories prime us for other stories. God damn homeschoolers. You are simply the least socialized creatures anyone has ever met. =). You just don't know how to talk to people, do you? Why aren't you more normal? Did your parents hate you or something? How do you not know this? like, everyone knows dis. You must not be worth my time, and you are more useful to me as an object of ridicule. I bet ur a walking time bomb: quiet and obedient through childhood, then you get out of the house and explode. You are teh worst.

Wife basically claimed that [[my room smells|https://miro.medium.com/max/640/1*tB5hmrujirLWTlOKxu0-MA.gif]] like how a crowded elevator smells to a midget. She is short, just a couple inches from being //my// midget. `/lipbite`.

I don't know what time I fell asleep.
