title: 2021.09.24 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: H̶e̶l̶l̶ Life is other people.

Thunder, late into the morning. [[ASK]]ing. Very rough for them right now. Apparently, they aren't in the [[Whirlwind]], they //are// the whirlwind. Sent them to bed. Baking soda for my gums, as I've got a sore. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! 

She's up! Maybe enough sleep for her. She's in a stretchy baby blue and black polka dot dress that shows off her assets with her vest. Gonna see if it's possible for her to blackout scheduling meetings at 3; it eats too much into her time (and she's not the sort who gets ready to go in advance). Beyond class, just bureaucratic fights on the docket today. Made burritos, realized I forget the coffee (but it's too late for that), and got that salsa (Aldi is now carrying it!). 

[[TTTOTW]] + LEC Playoffs. I am of the opinion that they're also better than the Americans in their clutch teamfighting, but I'm not impressed by their macro or vision. Sleep by 10?

Woke at 4. Fuck yeah. Hit the spot. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Assignments. [[ASK]]ed. 10 straights hour. Good job. 

//The Walk// with my offspring. Coffee + Vapelyfe. My daughter didn't do much, but she had plenty to say about the German she studied (may she one day possess her mother's work ethic and purpose). I think she's far more interested in studying the nature of language while studying a language than actually learning the language for use. I don't mind, as I consider the former more important in both theory and practical matters (despite the fact that I'd very much like to see her attend a public school in Germany if she desired it). I got way more smirks out of her or from her today, and she got teased by the boys as she offered an unjustifiably elitist and shitty argument about narratives in games (I let my son do the work, and I cheered him on...truly unfair). My son did his work. 

A Date Night. //Raw Skintime//. //Project Runway// 18's Penultimate, the best episode, really, as we get to see into a version of the artists' lives (or, what they present to be), to see what they're made of in a somewhat less [artificial, money-driven, expertly produced, high-pressure] environment where they must perform without the usual resources and reasons. It's personal (even if parasocial), and I think it shows in their art; I need it for at least some of my interpretations of what they've done. I've watched a lot, and I can say that (a) Siriano is superior to Gunn (extremely high praise) for all the reasons you would think, and (b) the finalists are a cut above the history of the show. Their construction skills stand out the most. And, for all future contestants, draping is likely one of the fastest and most price-efficient techniques available (it shows again and again). I'm impressed by their work. Terrible humans. Don't deserve to breathe. Adore their work. Where they part with mine, my wife's opinions are usually incorrect, of course. =). The amount of neoliberalism in the show makes me sick. I hate these people. I'm glad I listen and know why they are worth hating. It's relieving to hold her, right there (she needed a blanket tonight because "it's so cold in here" [wtf are you talking, woman?]), in stunning contrast to those on the screen. I like that it doesn't matter what's on the screen nearly as much. It's a pretense to hold her on this mattress she despises. //Inform the Men!// Best of my life (and, I know I say that too often, but practice makes perfect, and, apparently, coffee is quite an aid). Cleaning (let her have the shower).

[[ASK]]ing. Fixed dinner up. My offspring have been asked to setup anonymized Zoom and prepare presenting their wikis to the Indieweb meetup (though they are under no obligation). We ate our burgers (mine were lettuce-wrapped, that's how you know they were healthy) and curly fries while judging people on the TV (it's invigorating, and I doubt there could anything more American). //Skintime// on the couch (first time together on it, and we fit in parallel!). She started falling asleep, snoring through the final runway show of the season. To be with you. She was feeling guilty for not writing tonight, but I think sleep makes more sense. She'll remember what she can remember tomorrow.

[[ASK]]ing. Final assignments. Footbath + [[TTTOTW]] + Water.
