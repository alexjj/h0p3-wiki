[18:33:32] h0p3: Hello, sir. How are you doing today? What have you been up to?
[18:33:37] Galaxian: been to paris 2 days
[18:33:48] h0p3: Sounds fancy. What did you do there?
[18:33:50] Galaxian: visiting an haunt
[18:34:01] h0p3: Ah. Was it enjoyable?
[18:34:06] Galaxian: yes very
[18:34:11] Galaxian: we went by train
[18:34:20] h0p3: How long was the ride?
[18:34:27] Galaxian: 2 hours
[18:34:30] Galaxian: + taxi
[18:34:38] h0p3: Not bad.
[18:34:43] Galaxian: :)
[18:34:45] h0p3: You bring anything to read on the train?
[18:34:59] h0p3: I'm a graphic novel fan.
[18:35:08] Galaxian: no, i listened to music
[18:35:14] h0p3: Well, that too. Both. =)
[18:35:19] Galaxian: :)
[18:35:29] h0p3: I can barely stand being anywhere without having some music to soothe or energize me. 
[18:35:42] h0p3: Too much information to process in the world for me, I think.
[18:36:06] Galaxian: i went there with my mother father and the dog
[18:36:30] h0p3: A family outing.
[18:36:39] Galaxian: taxis dislike dogs so we said my mother needs a dog because not seeing well
[18:36:56] Galaxian: lol
[18:37:14] h0p3: Is the dog trained to assist her in that regard?
[18:37:28] Galaxian: we said so, but it's not the case lol
[18:37:34] h0p3: `/nod`.
[18:47:51] Galaxian: going to sleep, see you tomorrow :)

[04:51:10] Galaxian: hi dude :)
[08:18:52] h0p3: Yo. =)
[11:53:10] Galaxian: how are you?
[11:53:31] h0p3: Pretty good. High. Grinding. Drafting to [[fourmyle57]] atm.
[11:53:43] Galaxian: i've been playing games
[11:54:03] h0p3: I would be interested in your opinion on [[2022.12.03 - fourmyle57: Never to be used as mere means by all non-mere machines]] if you have the time and desire. 
[11:54:19] h0p3: What games?
[11:54:22] Galaxian: i don't know what is fourmyle57
[11:54:30] Galaxian: mostly hearthstone
[11:54:48] h0p3: https://philosopher.life/#fourmyle57
[11:55:28] h0p3: Never played Hearthstone, but as a [[magic]] player, I bet I'd enjoy it.
[11:55:43] Galaxian: yes you would
[11:56:00] Galaxian: and if you don't have many cards, you can play ranked with classic ones
[11:56:26] Galaxian: i used to play Magic with real cards at school
[11:56:32] h0p3: Good times
[12:02:34] Galaxian: do you smoke or vap?
[12:03:27] h0p3: I vape. Call it my clarinet.
[12:03:34] Galaxian: :)

[12:04:16] Galaxian: lol
[12:09:07] Galaxian: what do you vape?
[12:09:20] h0p3: Δ⁸
[12:09:34] Galaxian: what's this?
[12:09:37] h0p3: Very inexpensive
[12:09:53] Galaxian: i vap nicotin and sometimes cbd
[12:11:05] h0p3: 4.5ml that cost me ~$7 has lasted me over 6 months. 
[12:11:28] h0p3: Some call me a medicinal user. 
[12:12:58] h0p3: nicotine is apparently a great nootropic, but I'm too scared of it
[12:13:30] Galaxian: 6 or 8 month ago i used to take cbd everyday, but not anymore
[12:14:00] h0p3: how'd you consume it?
[12:14:07] Galaxian: oil
[12:14:10] h0p3: `/nod`
[12:14:14] Galaxian: but right now i vap it
[12:14:26] h0p3: We make tinctures here.
[12:15:42] Galaxian: if one day you try Hearthstone, tell me we would play together, i use european server
[12:15:57] Galaxian: we would play classic
[12:16:27] Galaxian: this way, not many cards to have
[12:16:36] h0p3: Thank you. I appreciate that.
[12:16:46] Galaxian: choose european server
[12:16:50] Galaxian: not USA
[12:16:58] h0p3: I understand.
[12:17:01] Galaxian: :)
[12:17:15] Galaxian: it's a bit easier to play than Magic
[12:17:26] Galaxian: you can't play during opponent turn
[12:25:11] Galaxian: https://www.blizzard.com/
[12:25:53] h0p3: Quite a history
[12:26:13] Galaxian: history? why?
[12:26:26] Galaxian: you can also with blizzard app play other games
[12:26:26] h0p3: They've produced some of the most important [[games]] in my life.
[12:26:31] Galaxian: :)
[12:26:48] Galaxian: do you have time to try hearthstone right now?
[12:27:03] h0p3: Unfortunately, I am working not to play games.
[12:27:11] Galaxian: you can find decks on the net, adding them with a string
[12:27:12] h0p3: I do so under strict conditions at this point.
[12:27:19] Galaxian: ok :/
[12:29:16] Galaxian: a great game over steam : Black desert online
[12:29:24] Galaxian: one of the best rpg game
[12:29:29] Galaxian: better than diablo
[12:29:39] Galaxian: you can play free, as i do
[12:30:11] h0p3: I do appreciate the offer. Thank you. Kinda playin' life like a [[vidya]] [[game]], in a sense.
[12:30:46] h0p3: Trying to find the treasures, experiences, causes, and purposes that matter most here on Earth (and beyond).
[12:30:57] Galaxian: :)

[05:35:14] h0p3: Down to less than 100 tabs, which is like a miracle for me.
