While borrowing in its own currency, the US imperially enforces built-in artificial demand for USD worldwide, running current account deficits as a net-exporter of dollars it prints (long-term damaging domestic manufacturing for short-term import cost reductions), dominating forexes as the most liquid currency (60% of global trade volume) that also denominates most international debts and banking, and forcing almost all other nations to hold a combination of USD reserves or treasuries (to earn interest on their reserves) in order to defend the pegs of their own currencies in times of crisis by selling treasuries (often for USD) and using the reserves to buy back their own currencies to support their value. All the meanwhile the US disproportionately exports much of its inflation to other countries (in exchange for the cheapest imported goods, commodities, and services of any nation for Americans to boot) who even in bullish years must print even more of their own currencies to buy dollars as their economies grow (and hence their reserves must scale too), only exacerbating the difficulty of defending their own currency or slowing inflation. Currently, the demand for the dollar continues to rise as the rate of supply falls, i.e. QE has stopped, because raising rates triggers margin calls on the entire world in which foreign countries must buy, borrow, and trade in USD (which is also considered the primary safe haven as there are guaranteed bidders). This is Triffins' Dilemma, spurring a global monetary (and hence economic) collapse unless the Fed drops rates and begins printing dollars again to meet the demand of USD, temporarily stabilize the liquidity of the global financial system, and restart the doomsday clock (mass global defaults with a switch to another global reserve option, assuming the enforcement of USD fiat would even allow it, and perhaps the USMIC's goal really is world war).

Forget their public mandates. Internally, the Fed sees their job as ~~maintaining public relations~~ damage control, oscillating the world between the crises of defaulting from QT or inflating from QE, convincing the world that it was our idea to "force" the Fed to switch back to the other crisis-inducing strategy, kicking the can down the road, and hiding the fundamental systemic risk while the wealthy try to find the exits. Ironically, in capitalism empowered by MMT (wherein private finance has completely taken over crucial roles of government), Friedman's claim that "the government solution to a problem is usually as bad as the problem" might be correct.

Note that the strengthening of the USD relative to other currencies does not imply that the USD isn't falling in real terms due to inflation, it just means other nations are even worse off.

The cryptoapes are salivating at the dollar rising so quickly that perhaps not even a Plaza Accord will be considered, but instead a complete migration from the USD to their cryptocurrency of choice. It remains far from obvious to me that chaos will have their preferred outcomes. I have no sympathy for those who pray for the downfall of the current regime of capitalism only because they personally will eventually profit from it.
