*** Though, perhaps they'll drop it `/pray`, lmao. Seems less likely though given that Android and ChromeOS have been wildly successful and maintained. They've been at this for years too, and I suggest it's being unleashed given their predictions for Android. I do not understand enough of why though, besides the immediate control (which is plenty enough).

*** I admire the [[Straussian]] attempt though. Cute. Glad I'm analytic. Cut right through it.

*** Meeting one's heroes. Recovering the language of class warfare with honesty and integrity means slitting these throats too in some respects.

*** Seems like schools aren't built or valued correctly then. I actually am open to a year in the world like that though. Wake up, children.

*** Unfortunately, [[BDS97]] may be correct. CRDTs are not wildly (if they are at all) more well-suited to P2P decentralization, or I don't see it yet. I'm hoping it is.
**** There are so many fucking things one has to be an expert in to do this right. It's ridiculous. Ultimately, the real problem is always the network here. Nobody has a good answer, literally. I need experts in at least 4 domains to build [[Outopos]]. I have to wait for more pieces. Maybe this thing doesn't even arise in my lifetime (if at all, obviously).
