title: Wiki Audit: The Button Project

//In honor of [[Sphygmus]]...//

[[Auto-Wiki-Mator-Button]] has revealed to me the value of committing to TW (not just any wikified tool, but TW itself). I have a quest coming up (though I don't know when I set out for it). I hope to become someone who can design his interfaces as well as [[Sphygmus]].<<ref "2021.01.22-ᛝLightᛝ-1">> Her gift is wasn't just useful upfront; it opened my eyes, awakening me from my dogmatic slumber. I must first understand more of the dynamic structure I'm building before I dive into this project. [[The Remodeling]] must be completed.
