I apologize for how long it sometimes takes for me to respond to people, you included. I actually deleted (a very rare thing for me) my original drafting to you from exactly 6 months ago. I've just been sitting on it. Lurkin'. Thinkin'.<<ref "n">> You know [[hao]] [[itdo]]. My [[new]] [[friend]], [[sinan]], has a very cautious approach, much like yourself; it's taken years to [[connect]].<<ref "d">> Assuming I am so [[lucky]], I can imagine that our relationship might take quite a while to develop. We're paranoid, and it's an earned paranoia with us, I take it.

You're among the most interesting sort I encounter online, and you know that.<<ref "1k">> Even [[our initial meeting|2021.04.07 - Anonymous: A Good Morning 2 U]] was quite a surprise to me. You remind me of [[ASmith]]'s popping out of the woodwork to speak with a fellow madman. Part of the problem that we all face is figuring out how to put our skin in the game. Of what you do reveal or put in, yours may be heavily fragmented and distributed across a variety of networks, from what little I can see and guess. I'm a fan of your unique posting style too; I wouldn't know how to do it [[justice]]. In any case, I'd like to understand your story. That might not be something you want to [[share]], but I think that's part of the next step for a relationship together (especially given some of our profound disagreements almost paradoxically mixed with agreements on rare and difficult topics). 

You spend a lot of time speaking with people, I appreciate how you tailor your messaged so thoroughly. You have a rare skill and drive in what remains of the Wild West, we terrible rats living in the sewers (cowabunga, dude). I have some more thoughts on our communications.

> Notice that I am Deconstructive (Left) + Hierarchy (Right). I have a hypothesis that ENTPs/contrarians/egotists (me) will consistenly score this outcome.

Do you mean to bundle those are distinct characteristics or a more unified type? Is that ENTPness to you?

Egotism is definitely a problem we'd have to [[wrestle]] about. It's pretty rare that I continue a conversation with anyone at this juncture. I've seen some of your arguments, and I think you've seen some of mine here. It's a very expensive place to reason about. And, I openly recognize that we may have a fundamental disagreement that runs deep enough that we should be [[silent]] with each [[other]] here. I'll still lurk though, and I [[aim]] to be cordial.

<<<

I think that is a generous attempt. I've used almost all of these descriptions. Hyperstudio is an interesting words. Sometimes I feel that way about my [[monster]] and my desk more generally as well.

<<<
Speaking of hyperlinked, let's mention Xanadu
<<<

This is a fairly common topic I run into when thinking about my ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱. I'll agree that we're just beginning to even understand the limits of hypertext. You may find Sir [[kickscondor]] a skilled and stylish person on this matter. I'd like to see what you think of his multiverse work too.

<<<
The ability to link directly to an annotation. (e.g. linking to a timestamp in a video; linking to an anchor, but you can "make" an anchor anywhere on the page e.g. with a diff patch when linking someone)
<<<

TW is poorly designed for this in some respects, though it's quite reasonable if we're looking at a Tiddler as the atomic semantic unit (unfortunately, there are so many cases in which going by line, or even more fine-grained, is the preference for some kinds of annotative projects, including commentary nesting).

<<<
There's some other crap he threw in there like addresses being permanent which is obviously a pet idea bolted on and not essential to the purpose, and he got touchy about the trademark and other things.
<<<

I think having permanent key-based addresses (solve Zooko's however you wish) and relatively stable URIs makes a lot of sense, even if it requires replacing sections of older linking. That's something I value about my ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱. I've served it over a wide variety of networks, and there's something to be said for having [[link]]s that at least partially work across them all.

His opinion about IP may be quite poorly conceived in the end, perhaps as ridiculous as NFTs.

<<<
Of course the same concept is useful both connecting between websites but also building a single person-internal "memory engine", as your website demonstrates.
<<<

It definitely has that going on, no doubt. I also think it's interpersonal, and not all bits on this ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 are mine. There's collaboration, plenty of copy'n'paste, and even gifts in here. 

<<<
Of course I can search for mind mapping software myself but if there is any you have personally used and recommend for or against it would speed my search.
<<<

I think it depends on what you are trying to accomplish and your other skills. I have to admit that if you are skilled as Madame Senpai [[chameleon]], you could probably make anything work. I'm not that skilled, and I'm far lazier too. I'm not terribly creative in many respects either, so that may be why TW is the only tool that has worked for me. Interface design is hard, and I rely upon skiddying my way through any of it. Everytime I idealize another answer, I'm immediately overwhelmed by how much work the front end would take to make it easier to re-engineer, re-skin, or make simple to wield (it's easier to talk about what the backend should look like, but even that has plenty of idealistic vaporware involved); I just don't have an absolute answer to what I think the final product should look like, so I'm stuck with the intermediate thing that has, ultimately, quite poor performance for what is almost strictly text. I also [[aim]] for something that can be used or learned by anyone (though it may take quite some time), [[WINTCIS]]. 

<<<
Ars Memoriae. Memory Palace. Masonry.

I have been getting into architectural trends...
<<<

This keeps popping up for me too. The City is ancient meme that may be a fitting metaphor to consider. I know we have radically different approaches to moral and political philosophy. You may find something useful yet from your enemies here. 

This might also be of interest: https://psionica.org/tools/conceptarium/

<<<
"semi-lattice" (categories and sub-categories, but with overlap)
<<<

I'd be interested in your thoughts on [[Tagging Theory]].

Thank you for your links. https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15026081-search-and-social seems pretty interesting too.

<<<
Hope you have a ham radio meshnet handy.
<<<

You keep going down this rabbithole, and I'm glad. Let me know if you ever stumble across low-cost microtik/ubiquiti quality microwave hardware. That may not be something for we mortals any time soon. Lower interference and low detection rates are hard problems the proletariat require. 

As rare as it may be for me to VC, I am considering joining your group VC on https://meet.jit.si/culturewar. Ultimately, I'm a fan of the written word, of course.


Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
