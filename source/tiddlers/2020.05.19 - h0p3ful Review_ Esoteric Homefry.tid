** I have plenty of empty tiddlers myself, homefry.
*[[Gratitude]]
** You and I both have a lot of work left to do before the deadline.
*[[0.999R and 1, the problems of infinity and 3.]]
** Your mom and I talked about this one on our walk. As I said before, I hope you end up walking through math proofs.
*[[2020.05.18 – Wiki Review: Yes but...]]
** I have no idea how that changed. Seems like something to search on le Google.
*** Do you search for "asses" on Google often? I do. Lol.
*[[2020.05.18 – TDL: Fix]]
** I hope you wrote about it.
*[[2020.05.18 – Prompted Introspection: Bats and Hats]]
** Your powers are underspecified.
** Lots of corrections to make as we talked about.

** I don't know if you [[title.Title]] is serious or not. Maybe you are just fucking with me. =)
*** What possessed you to write that?
**** Ah, yeah, this is going to be a fun rabbithole for ya. Unfortunately, it appears [[The Absolute]] must perfectly model [[Itself]], but this is where [[The Dialetheia]] appears to reside. 
** You have a ton of crazy claims in here that are unsubstantiated. "Everything is perfect"? What? Your argument isn't.
** I'm convinced you are talking out of your ass here, and that's even allowing for some major crazy talk in this realm.
*** The quote is a hard one. It's esoteric. Choose something easier. 
*** Maybe you understood what you meant to say, but I don't.
** You are correct to consider modeling the thing-in-itself here, and moreover, you are correct to be concerned with what it means to provide a perfect mode.

** I am glad you write in your wiki more consistently in 2020.
