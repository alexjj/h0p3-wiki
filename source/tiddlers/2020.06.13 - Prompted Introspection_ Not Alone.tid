title: 2020.06.13 - Prompted Introspection: Not Alone

!! How are you like one of your brothers or sisters?

[[2019.03.29 - Prompted Introspection: Like Brother]] is `/yawn` to me. Here's something I share with both of them: we can say anything. We celebrate the disgusting. We're [[intimate]]! We have worked really hard to understand each other and to boost each other. Even when [[AIR]] dropped off the map with everyone for a year, [[JRE]] and I were just sad and [[hoping]] he was okay. We tried reaching out often, but we didn't want to push him away (just let him know we're thinking about him and he's not forgotten at all [and he knew that, and he knew we knew that, and that was, of course, the first thing that we talked about as soon as we reconnected]). How am I like my brothers? I know damn well that they are my brothers, and they know that too. We [[love]] each [[other]]. We know each other's pain. They've taught me what it means to [[love]], like my wife and my offspring. I think it is what we share in common the most.
