Thanks as always for your help.
My first/overall reaction is AH FUCK IT. lol

Of course, I'll still keep my gmail account as, as you say, some 'ecosystems' require it to function. What I'll need to do specifically I guess is go through the 'privacy checkup' on my google accounts and just try to make sure things are tidy. I don't think I want to start a w hole new account; at this rate google has all my shit and I'm dependent on them. 

I'm not doing Linux and all that, so ... I mean, thankfully I odn't have anything that important to hide! I'm being paranoid, and practical, I guess.

Then again, this brexit/EU thing ... maybe it would be worth creating a new google account, providing a made-up address in the netherlands or something.
I take it a VPN is good for that kind of thing, right? I fucking hope so! I use it when I download tor re nts or, for example, i logged in from NY to watch the Trump Show last week.

Is Protonmail free? Might be worth setting up just to have it, jus tin case. ?

I'm glad you've got a basement :)
I'm still waiting on the whole kit and kaboodle! Hopefully summer comes in quick and we're in the house by winter. :P

Hugs!
