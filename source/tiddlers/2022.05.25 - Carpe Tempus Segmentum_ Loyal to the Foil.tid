title: 2022.05.25 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Loyal to the Foil

Took the trash out. Pacing, monching, and talking with [[Killcoin]]. Still some racism and plenty of pro-capitalist position, but not a nazi anymore. Lonely AF, feeling like he deserves to be alone. Walking through his books, and asking me talk about some Saints and hard places in philosophy. Ironically, some of the hard moves are easy for him. More thinkin' about what Saint Jesus demands on our lives. Wandered our family's stories. Knows [[JRE]] doesn't [[like]], but still cares about [[JRE]] is doing. CBD for his back, figurines, a [[Discord]] conversation with his daughter. Said a dozen times his goal is to become a good person. I respect that. I can only remember bits and pieces, unfortunately. Was a good talk.

Sleep by 2:15. Back to sleep for my sympaticon. Knocked out immediately. 

Woke at 9:15. It was enough. Meditation. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. My sympaticon is thinking about contacting [[JRE]]. 

//The Walk// with my sympaticon. Went to the waterfall. It was quiet and [[beautiful]]. Got us a walking stick chopped, and I think it will be about right. There were fish today, and way more bugs everywhere. It is much busier on the weekends, `/nod`. Didn't need help from the phone getting back. 

Assignments. Offspring still hadn't done it. I know it's quite tempting to sit and talk.

[[D2]] for a bit. Some chitchat with my symapticon. Twerk found an Um.

Took the grindwheel to the bathtub. Made a huge mess, including all over [[myself|https://i.redd.it/stduyf43nm191.jpg]]. Glad we manually hit it first, as it would have been horrific otherwise. May still need to grind again (and almost burned through the wheel we have, which aint cheap). Cleanup, with the help of my son.

[[TTTOTW]]. 

[[D2]]. Twerk found a Sur!! One more or just a flat Ber, and we're cookin' up an Enigma. 

My sympaticon needed sleep. We both hit the hay.

Woke at 5? [[TTTOTW]].

//The Walk// with mi amor. Her world congeals. The Dean is looking for her to wear two hats in a few years, both of which have been lifelong dreams. She can find lots of chaplains in higher ed, but not like this. A walk through the past to understand our future.

[[5c0ut]] has excellent news. A sous chef job offer, 55k, 20 minutes away, and another position he's interviewing for that has more admin aspects (something he aims to improve upon, as it opens many doors, including filling remaining exec chef holes). Strategizing and weighing. There is a lot to think about. 

Made dinner with my sympaticon. 

[[TTTOTW]].

My sympaticon and I skipped dinner while the other had the [[Family Gathering]]. 

//The Walk// with my sympaticon. Hard dialectics. [[Wrestling]]. Ran across Bill, Stacy, and 2% again. Introduced my sympaticon. Bill said he couldn't make sense of the card. `/nod`. He got some shots today. 2% had surprisingly little to say, apologized cause he was kinda drunk (mirrored my body language considerably). Showed me his Harley, and Stacy was clearly very into it (and into my sympaticon being into it). She called me a pimp. Yeah, `/nod`, that sounds like me. They are interested in meeting up. Dope. Continued a hard walk and talk. 

Written, multi-threaded dialectics, without much space or time, with my sympaticon. Caffeine and water for the all-nighter.
