title: 2020.12.01 - Prompted Introspection: Worthy Painful Experience

!! What difficult or painful experience would you recommend to everyone?

This is a great question. Thank you, Samwise. I will hand my cliche, ridiculously privileged, and narrow-minded answer in the first round: write in a [[ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱]] (a wiki, a digital garden, a second brain, or whatever you need to call it), [[aim]] to do it every day, seek that which matters most, and talk to yourself and [[others]] in this flexible alien space. I'm amazed by the number of people who are highly educated who don't see the value in the practice; they are clearly missing something crucial. I think this is 21st Century tooling for philosophers, and it just so happens I think everyone should be the best philosopher they can be. Oddly enough, there can be a putting your money where your mouth is in even having forced yourself to use your mouth with consistency and integrity. What is worthy about universal endurance of the pain of this discipline is a matter of {[[Principle]]}, [[faith]], knowing what it is like to be Dasein toward what matters most, an account through which we can be accountable, an exercise of autonomy worth celebrating, and lived recognition of storytelling as central to our experience.
