The naive strategy of alienating, failing to engage with, and listen to those we don't like is narcissistic. The goal isn't to appear inviting: it's to live it, especially when we don't like someone. Anyone can maintain a pleasant surface; our obligation is much higher. Hospitality is a concept so few study anymore. How many moments do you have in life where you are essentially living the intention of the maxim: "I don't care if I feel happy with you or I don't like it, it's not about me, and I'm not going anywhere: I should be here with you." That's what [[love]] looks like often enough. Obviously, we must still engage in justified game-theoretic reasoning about orbiting and mimesis.

Justified immanent critique requires having a foot inside and out of the simulation. I think it's my job to live outside The City, even if I must virtualize it, nomad.

Edgegasm: part of my job as a 'tist is to, with integrity, cure people of the delusions that they like me or that they are like me.

I agree that minds like ours experience magic and are magical at some level. I deny science and mathematics can provide the ultimate analysis or fitting metanarrative. Metaphysics cannot be escaped. Hate the noumena all you want. [[Phenomenologists|Phenomenology]] must bow before this problem as well. Pointing words do seem especially potent in the magic formula. I admire why the saints caution us not to speak more than we have to about the ineffable. Who could be humble enough? It's our plight though, and that's why they couldn't stop talking about it either. Magic towers and libraries of babbl. Humanity can never seek only itself nor that which could even conceptually be reduced to an instrument simpliciter, including the physical universe.

People usually only give you the benefit of the doubt if they know that you are one of their tribe. Not a stranger, not a threat, but one of them, and, generally, there better be something in it for them. No autist is going to be given the benefit of the doubt all the way down then. I don't talk your speak, stranger, and I don't have what you want. As a HF autist, I'm well aware of the fact that most don't find me pleasant to be around, and it paradoxically gives me some perspectival advantages (though I am slow) in peeling apart masks from motives in some cases. Picking out irrationality, some of it malicious, allows me handle so much rejection too. Chalk it up and move on. Benefit of the doubt is hard to come by to the point that I have to plan for hostility well in advance. I do aim to avoid being a victim, but I must internalize some defense given my history and understanding of the world.

You have asked me to prioritize my life, fluidly, teacher, and I have. I feel like a Monte Carlo simulator. You still won't like the results. =/.

Skin in the game requirements decrease some kinds of performativity I'm worried about.

<br>

Destigmatize without normalizing.

Ghost in The Shell, come out of your shell. Be with me.
