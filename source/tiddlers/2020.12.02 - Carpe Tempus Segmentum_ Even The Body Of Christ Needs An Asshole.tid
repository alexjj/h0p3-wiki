title: 2020.12.02 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Even The Body Of Christ Needs An Asshole

* Woke at midnight
** I feel much better. Even just a few hours of sleep did it.
* Read
* AFireman Time!
* Pizza, //GoT//, and packing. 
** Almost everything taken off the walls. Looks barren. 
* Sleep by 6
** I'm having closed-eye hallucinations right before I slip away, but not exclusively the geometric sort and I made (or felt I made) boobs appear. Life is good. 
* Woke by Noon
** Dreams. Vividness beyond usual. 
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Hardcore packing...
** I am not a fan of packing my wife's things as I am not a great guesser of what she will want in the gap. I did a good job though. 
** My daughter was unhappy, but that dissipated thankfully.
*** It's a swirl of emotions for her. We have baggage when it comes to her room, and moving is painful (even for hikis). It takes a toll. 
** Our family has joked that we never really fully unpacked, and that's because we were pretty sure we wouldn't be living here for more than year. It will have been 11 months. 
* Inform the Men!
* Meditation
* Fell asleep. 
* Woke at 6:30?
* Everyone scrounged, //GoT//
* I'm going to try to keep the books in boxes even at the house. I want to see how long it takes before we really need one of these books. I have been threatened over these objects countless times. =D. 
* //Skintime// until I fell asleep.
* Woke at 11:45
* Fireman Time!
