"""
[22:31:25][ratz333] hello
[22:34:59][h0p3] Hello =)
[22:35:29][ratz333] been looking through a bunch or random rooms and i see you in many of them 
[22:35:48][h0p3] Indeed. Sometimes I read through what people have been saying.
[22:36:12][h0p3] Unfortunately, I've not found it viable to hold conversations in them. People leave quickly, in my experience.
[22:36:58][ratz333] yeah that is true. 
[22:37:12][ratz333] i thought since you seem to be in many rooms, why not say hello. 
[22:37:20][h0p3] Hell yeah.
[22:37:28][h0p3] I'm glad to meet you.
[22:37:35][h0p3] This is me, btw: https://philosopher.life
[22:37:44][h0p3] I spend a stupid amount of time on it.
[22:38:24][h0p3] You come on Soulseek often? Are there other P2P communities you've found worthwhile?
[22:39:34][ratz333] i have been using slsk since 2002. and yeah i do come on every day. 
[22:39:58][ratz333] i did take a break cause i have a troll harassing me, but i just ignore him 
[22:40:11][h0p3] How does he harrass you?
[22:40:25][h0p3] I've not encountered that behavior yet*. Not sure what to do about it.
[22:40:55][h0p3] is this you? eddie_hargrave@hotmail.com
[22:41:16][ratz333] i spend a lot of time in the canada room, we use to be friends and chat all the time. then i noticed he would talk about private things i said in the open chat room 
[22:41:31][ratz333] how do you know my email 
[22:41:39][h0p3] https://medium.com/@bradleyborys/hello-raleigh-ec30f4e7941b
[22:42:07][h0p3] Searching your name up, trying to learn more about you, find your [[Public Self-Model]]s, etc.
[22:43:30][ratz333] hmmm
[22:43:46][h0p3] This may be important to you: https://philosopher.life/#Contact%20h0p3
[22:43:52][ratz333] yeah i wrote that. she use to be a friend i chatted with on slsk, but disaperared 
[22:44:03][h0p3] That sucks. =(
[22:44:19][h0p3] I know what it's like for friends on the net to disappear. 
[22:44:55][h0p3] I've been using slsk off and on for a long time as well. Pretty cool that this community has lasted this long.
[22:45:43][ratz333] im not sure why you shared this. for me to contact you? 
[22:45:46][ratz333] https://philosopher.life/#Contact%20h0p3
[22:46:25][h0p3] I [[shared]] it because it explains how I communicate with [[others]] online, and in case you prefer to speak over different tools.
[22:47:10][h0p3] For example, if I stopped coming on soulseek for some reason, you'd still be able to reach me. 
[22:47:20][ratz333] aha
[22:47:57][h0p3] I [[hope]] to stay on slsk though. I [[like]] serving files to folks.
[22:48:07][h0p3] And, I meet a variety of cool people here too.
[22:48:40][h0p3] [[Recent]]ly, [[The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum]] and [[NemoRevera]]. I'm writing [[letter]]s to them.
[22:48:43][ratz333] im gonna be honest. i dont really read much. and your page way a lot to read 
[22:48:53][h0p3] Yeah, way too many words. I'm sorry. I know that is painful.
[22:48:55][h0p3] It's alright.
[22:49:20][h0p3] What do you enjoy doing with your free time?
[22:50:10][ratz333] chatting. gaming, listening to music. watching movies / tv 
[22:50:34][h0p3] noice, I spend my fair share of time doing roughly the same
[22:52:27][ratz333] so tell me how you found my email. 
[22:53:23][h0p3] I looked up your name, "ratz333", and it's the fourth item listed on the search.
[22:54:12][ratz333] ah. i thought you were some kind of hacker
[22:55:05][h0p3] I'm just a person who enjoys his [[computer|monster]] a whole bunch.
[22:55:21][h0p3] Not terribly skilled with it, unfortunately.
[22:56:05][h0p3] A surprising number of [[pirates|Piracy]] and hackers I've met over the decades come from Canada. 
[22:56:14][h0p3] I have no idea why.
[22:56:18][ratz333] i went to a lot of trouble deleting info about me on google. but i guess i missed that 1 thing. i left it hoping my friend would respond 
[22:56:45][h0p3] `/nod`. Sacrifices we make for people.
[22:56:55][h0p3] I know how that goes, my [[friend|Friendship]]. 
[22:57:23][ratz333] i dont know how it is now, but canada use to have slack piracy laws. 
[22:57:36][h0p3] Aye. ISPs seemed way cooler.
[22:59:21][h0p3] What do you do to survive in the world?
[22:59:58][ratz333] um. what do you mean? job wise? 
[23:00:08][ratz333] i am in between jobs. was in printing 
[23:00:14][h0p3] Oh, neat.
[23:00:31][h0p3] I did some printing, long ago. Factory job, before my [[daughter|j3d1h]] was born. 
[23:00:36][h0p3] What kind of printing you do?
[23:01:14][ratz333] it was printing books 
[23:01:44][h0p3] That is dope. I did magazines, newpapers, and things like that.
[23:01:49][h0p3] Did you do any of the binding?
[23:02:15][ratz333] i was the one who stacked the boxes of books, which is why i quit, cause i came to the job with a degree and there was no hopes of moving up in the company 
[23:02:47][h0p3] ah, shit, yeah =/
[23:03:20][ratz333] but hey. its time for my shower. i shall return 
[23:03:29][h0p3] I left for a similar reason. Some guys on the line had been there for decades, and they said it would be a long time before I'd be making even a living wage.
[23:03:34][h0p3] `/salute`.
* ratz333 is away.
* ratz333 is available.
[23:54:37][ratz333] sup
[23:58:30][h0p3] Yo
[23:59:04][h0p3] Just got me some lemonade, chillin' with my brother, [[5c0ut]], and my sympaticon, [[ASK]].
[23:59:31][h0p3] Been playing some [[Diablo II]] tonight as well (a very rare treat for me).
[0:00:50][ratz333] why you keep putting names in [ ] 
[0:01:10][h0p3] these are all [[Links]] to pages in my ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱. 
[0:01:39][ratz333] ah. well they dont click for me 
[0:01:43][h0p3] I write {[[about]]} my life quite a bit. It's part of my vocation. 
[0:01:52][h0p3] `/nod`.
[0:02:39][ratz333] i dont want to interupt your time with your brother
[0:02:48][h0p3] Naw, I'm down here to speak with you.
[0:03:01][h0p3] I got to catch up with him. 
[0:03:28][h0p3] You're the guest in my [[house|The Alien Asylum]]. I'm glad to be here.
[0:03:56][h0p3] I live in the basement, btw. 
[0:04:18][h0p3] Temperature is nice. So hot upstairs.
[0:06:12][h0p3] So, I take it you aren't much of a fan of Hillary Clinton. 
[0:07:50][ratz333] hahaha
[0:07:56][ratz333] is anyone? 
[0:08:22][h0p3] I've met some who are. I can't say I think they've got great reasons for it. 
[0:08:59][h0p3] How would you categorize your perspectives in politics?
[0:09:28][h0p3] Canadian politics isn't something I know very well, but I do read about it from time to time.
[0:11:19][ratz333] i never use to follow. but i do a lot now. mainly cause i dont like how biden in america and trudeau in canada are destroying out countries
[0:11:29][ratz333] and everything good about it
[0:11:50][h0p3] I can't say I'm a fan of either of these men.
[0:12:34][h0p3] What would you do differently if you were foisted into their positions?
[0:13:00][h0p3] Is inflation hittin' hard up there?
[0:13:22][ratz333] first thing i would do is cancel that green new deal crap and open up all the pipe lines
[0:13:28][ratz333] and yeah it is 
[0:14:10][h0p3] `/nod`. 
[0:14:31][h0p3] I heard it's pretty expensive to try and buy a house in many parts of Canada. 
[0:16:06][ratz333] yeah. our govt screwed us over pushing identity politics and making us pay for carbon tax 
[0:16:42][h0p3] I definitely have my serious concerns with identity politics as a misdirecting red herring.
[0:16:51][h0p3] What do you think matters most in the universe?
[0:17:38][ratz333] i dont even think about that kind of stuff. it seems to big for me, i just stick to this world 
[0:17:40][ratz333] for now 
[0:17:56][h0p3] Oh, yeah, okay, what matters most in this world?
[0:20:45][ratz333] things i focus mostly on is good music, my few friends. 
[0:20:58][ratz333] i guess being healthy, or attempting to be
[0:21:07][h0p3] Flourishing
[0:21:47][h0p3] If you had only 10 songs you could take with you to a desert island, what would they be? I'm always on the hunt for my [[Music: Library]], and it's so hard to narrow down, imho.
[0:22:18][h0p3] I can't say I'm terribly healthy, my friend. I'm overweight. I like food way too much. It's a drug for me.
[0:23:02][ratz333] i am a little on the chubby side as well. but i am trying hard to get things back in balance
[0:23:37][ratz333] and as for the songs. last year i was told to pick my top 10 fav albums. i can suggest to you. 
[0:24:23][h0p3] I'm all for recommendations of what is [[salient]]. Go for it.
[0:26:55][ratz333] i listen mainly to early to mid 1990s alternative. mainly grunge. and trance music. circa 1999 to 2004 
[0:27:36][ratz333] the albums i picked are as listed. in no specific order
[0:29:38][ratz333] red hot chili peppers, blood sugar sex magik. counting crows august and everything after, blind melon self titled, pearl jam vitology, moby play, sound garden super unkown, meat loaf bat out of hell, snoop dog doggy style and house of pain first 0 fine malt lyrics. 
[0:29:54][ratz333] oh, and 
[0:30:01][ratz333] chicaner- behind the sun 
[0:31:28][h0p3] classics
[0:31:30][h0p3] I gotcha
[0:32:09][h0p3] Well, thank you. I appreciate it.
[0:33:14][ratz333] i use to be obsessed with pearl jam. but i dont listen to them anymore. mainly cause they were with me through some hard times, and now when i listen it reminds me of those times
[0:33:41][h0p3] Yes, sir. I know how that is.
[0:34:25][h0p3] Mixed feelings about that sort of thing. I'm [[grateful]], but it's also unpleasant.
[0:34:55][ratz333] also they started to suck when they became political. 
[0:36:27][h0p3] ah
[0:37:16][ratz333] my name is bradley btw 
[0:37:23][ratz333] im sure you guessed that 
[0:38:43][h0p3] Yes, sir.
[0:39:17][h0p3] So, did Covid affect every day life for you considerably?
[0:40:02][ratz333] i guess so. i didnt go out as much. but then again i never did go out much to begin with 
[0:40:30][h0p3] I don't go out much if I can help it either. I'm something like a hiki, as they say.
[0:40:43][h0p3] I suppose we were already quarantining, in a sense.
[0:42:00][ratz333] im not sure what hiki is 
[0:42:29][h0p3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikikomori
[0:43:30][ratz333] just a heads up. if you take the S out of https/ it becomes a link i can click 
[0:43:54][h0p3] I am surprised.
[0:44:10][h0p3] why is that?
[0:44:27][ratz333] i think the s is for secure. 
[0:44:32][h0p3] Indeed.
[0:45:12][ratz333] so you are a hermit? 
[0:46:18][h0p3] Yeah. I'm a hermit of some kind.
[0:46:33][h0p3] I'd say I'm a hermit out here in the digital desert too.
[0:46:49][ratz333] im not that bad, i do like to go out. shopping and for coffee. 
[0:46:57][h0p3] `/nod`. 
[0:49:25][h0p3] What are some of your biggest regrets in life? 
[0:50:08][ratz333] um. i need to think about that 
[0:52:43][ratz333] a lot of stuff i regret was out of my control. and was because of others. 
[0:55:36][ratz333] can i ask your name 
[0:55:47][h0p3] My name is [[h0p3]]. 
[0:56:21][h0p3] It is a name I chose for myself many years ago, when I felt I lost it. 
[0:56:54][ratz333] aha
[0:57:24][ratz333] i will get back to you about that last question. its too late to think about stuff like that 
[0:57:33][h0p3] I hear that. Definitely late. 
[0:58:39][ratz333] you like to read? 
[0:58:44][ratz333] http://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-octopus-eating-meat-ethics/
[0:59:06][h0p3] I don't read a lot of books, but I am someone who consumes a lot of content on the web.
[0:59:14][h0p3] Thank you for the link!
[0:59:49][h0p3] What do you think about this article?
[1:00:12][h0p3] I'm interested in this topic, though I can't say I know enough about it.
[1:00:21][ratz333] thats the thing. i am interested but it is way too long
[1:00:56][h0p3] There are tools that help summarize articles, though I've not found any I felt were consistently worthwhile.
[1:01:54][ratz333] i was going to send it to a friend and have her sumerize it but she is not available 
[1:03:37][h0p3] I spend a lot of time poring over feeds on the web, digging, hyperreading, lookin' for answers to hard problems.
[1:03:58][h0p3] I can't say I'm terribly successful at it. I'd even argue my reading skill has suffered over the years. 
[1:11:42][ratz333] youre a gamer?> 
[1:12:18][h0p3] I think so. It's hard to pick out what counts as one. I've played [[vidya]] [[games]] for 30 years (I assume we're about the same there). 
[1:12:34][h0p3] I don't play much these days, but that's alright.
[1:12:48][h0p3] I used to play Everquest, if that means anything to ya.
[1:13:01][h0p3] How about you?
[1:13:50][ratz333] i started gaming out of bordom. now i really enjoy it. its like a 200 hour long movie that you control 
[1:14:44][h0p3] Oh, yes. It's quite a medium in which we can explore a world someone built for us, and I think, in a sense, also learn more about ourselves too.
[1:14:53][h0p3] There's autonomy and choices to be made in many games.
[1:15:11][h0p3] What are some of the games that have influenced you the most?
[1:15:38][h0p3] I have to be careful with games. I've an addictive personality. It's easy to have them consume my life. 
[1:15:53][h0p3] That's one of my biggest regrets, actually.
[1:16:23][ratz333] my all time fav game is red dead redemption 2. 
[1:16:36][ratz333] been playing grand theft auto 5, 
[1:16:39][h0p3] `/nod`. Yeah. I heard that's a [[good]] one.
[1:16:43][h0p3] That too.
[1:17:05][h0p3] I played the original way back, but it's nothing like the gorgeous work they do these days.
[1:17:19][h0p3] Worlds to get lost in.
[1:21:37][h0p3] Do you enjoy creating anything? If so, what do you create?
[1:23:46][ratz333] um. i use to write poetry, but i dont anymore. i lost my muse
[1:24:14][h0p3] Quite an artform. I can barely understand it, let alone write it. 
[1:24:25][h0p3] What or who was your muse?
[1:25:55][ratz333] i use to have depression. and when i did i could write like no ones business. but then i started getting better and now i cant write. my sadness was my muse 
[1:26:04][h0p3] Ah
[1:26:07][h0p3] That makes sense.
[1:26:21][h0p3] I'm glad to hear you escaped that pit, go the wolf off your back.
[1:26:28][h0p3] A worthy sacrifice, imho.
[1:29:08][ratz333] i suppose. but sometimes i miss writing 
[1:29:22][h0p3] Journaling might be worth trying out.
[1:29:45][h0p3] I'd be happy to read what you write too.
[1:30:23][ratz333] i use to journal but no one read it and i felt it was pointless. 
[1:31:01][h0p3] Well, I think it makes sense to write to an imaginary audience, maybe to even write as though everyone is reading, even if no one is. Some might even say it's worth writing just for yourself.
[1:31:12][h0p3] I can appreciate how it can feel pointless though.
[1:33:10][ratz333] but hey., its 1230 am here. late. i should be getting to sleep 
[1:33:30][h0p3] Get some sleep, homie. It was my honor to speak with you.
[1:33:44][ratz333] yes nice meeting you
