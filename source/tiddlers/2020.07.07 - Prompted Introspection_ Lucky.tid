title: 2020.07.07 - Prompted Introspection: Lucky

!! Are you ever lucky? Tell about it.

Among other things, [[2019.06.27 - Prompted Introspection: Luck Afloat]] and [[2017.11.19 - Prompted Introspection Log: My Luck]] + [[DeathOfRobinhood]] have led me to write out my heterodox definition of (though I suggest effective common sense perspective on) [[Moral Luck]]. I don't think I partake of what wouldn't be available to me in a just world, but I also don't anticipate I will be this lucky for long. [[CTS]]: suck out the marrow. I'd like to move toward specifics, including unimportant ones that I've enjoyed.

My [[MTG]] swiss tournament structure monte carlo simulations suggest that (even on the assumption that anyone could play whatever deck they wanted to play, a huge anti-pay-2-play assumption) skill differences must be enormous to consistently provide the best players the win, including in very large tournaments. I've won some dope prizes that I believe are well above my skill differential. Even having the chance to play is luck, and winning big money has been an extra creamy gravy.
