title: 2020.07.07 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: We Didn't Need String

* Woke at noon
** Sore. Everyone was, lol.
* Came down to see my offspring had not prepped.
* Cleaning
* Prepped gear
** Found our tents too
* Drove us as close as we could get, dropped the gear down the gulley at the edge of the forest. Left my offspring to move the goods to the site, and I drove back.
* Walked back to the site, talked with [[AIR]]
** He's feeling down, like there's no [[hope]] in the world.
*** I'm a difficult man on the topic, as I don't let people bury their heads in the sand. 
*** [[Stoic]] reframing
** His job's benefits were exciting for him. 
** He's figuring out what he likes again. 
** Spotted my offspring on the trail (gangly creature ;P)
* Grabbed the remaining gear with them and took it to our site. It wasn't the original mark, but it was close and better.
** Although, I don't care for how close it is to the trail. 
* Sent my daughter off to scavenge tarp
* Son and I used our tools to clear an area. 
** Even had to use my giant axe.
** There's old trash in the area too. Started a pile.
** Tent area is tightly between three trees in case we need to build a canopy.
* Sent my son off to scavenge tarp
* Digging rocks out
* Where u at? Went to gather tarp too. Daughter was dragging a huge black tarp back. We needed the rake, so she came with me to find.
** My son was clearly lost in the woods. I never actually saw which direction he went. 
** Daughter and I found the old rake, and we cut what we could have a giant blue tarp partially buried in the ground. 
** I dragged the blue tarp back, found my son at the camp. Told him which direction to go for tarp, and to go help his sister or get his own.
** I wait...I go searching, and my daughter, who was supposed to be right behind me, had lost the rake, but she had her original black tarp. My son was clearly lost again. `/sigh`
** We all eventually got back to the camp.
* Black tarp went down first, rocks secured it.
* We build out the tents and secured them. 
** We should think about how to secure them further. They aren't meant to be permanent structures.
* We took a rest.
* Packed our gear in the tents
* Got the blue tarp over top the entire tent area, secured it with more rocks. 
* We had a come to jesus moment, as my offspring really hate working with their bodies due to a lack of practice.
* Walked back
* [[JRE]] called me back as he was driving back from [[AA]]'s
** He had bought supplies to do wiring for them.
** Battery died on me. =(
* Shower
* My wife clipped my toenails and talked with me.
* Fireman Time!
** Apparently, I am no longer allowed near her silk pillow cases. Skish.
*** It is jabba's wish that she swims through pools of cum.
* Pizza and //Masterchef//
** Never seen a full episode of this show. Awful. My wife adored it. I got to lay my head in her lap, and then she spooned with me. I got to chew on her and grab her while she watched. Deal.
** We giggled.
* //ATLA//
* I fell asleep at 11?
