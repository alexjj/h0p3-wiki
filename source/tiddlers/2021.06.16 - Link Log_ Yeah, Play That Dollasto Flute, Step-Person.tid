*** This is no Volvo move. Presumably, releasing it (a) to show they really care, and (b) setting the standard high enough while making it appear like they've improved the entrance of competition that they maintain a monopoly against two different legal pressure points. Setting that aside: cool AF. It's a critical step for decentralization, similar to encrypted file hosting (Freenet, Resilio Sync, etc.), but for computation (much, much fancier). Distributed databases, some of them partially encrypted, some fully, some not-at-all, different levels of r+w+x access across the clusters. Their federation (EEE) is still quite centrally controlled in a number of respects.

*** Fucks up on the centralization point, and it fails to appreciate what cirles of trust in social epistemology actually imply. Only insofar as liquid democracy obtains (and, even the state of nature populist discourses, however disconnected, are governments of a sort, and it is why we are responsible for the world still as it stands). That is The Gubmint's responsibility can be re-interpreted in terms of our responsibilities to enforce The Golden Rule from the bottom-up, but I doubt that is intended here.
