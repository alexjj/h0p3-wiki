I wonder how I shall spend the remaining 4-10 covids I've left in life.

Best I can rewrite for many of the conservatives I know: if you can, don't skip college (you should learn the material on your own either way) but do learn a trade. Commit to [[others]], especially those who you do not benefit from, as a matter of service and moral regret minimization. Join groups to explore and learn how to build the right ones. Don't have babies, but do adopt every child you ever encounter. Like learning, and as a part of it, teaching is everyone's duty. Practice surviving in many contexts. Paranoically consume capitalized media, but consume broadly to know where to consume deeply. More importantly, remember that every conversation is a sacrament, especially with your enemies.

Though we are at least partially captive to the meanings we believe and experience, we cannot internally create them entirely, even if consciousness necessarily requires a subjective, top-down imposition of models over sensations (hardly a complete explanation). We do not escape having to take realist's linguistic risks about the noumena. Not all contradictions are equal.

Insofar as authorial intent is dead because the way the audience interacts with a work has primacy over the work's causal impact, the ergodicity of the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 provides rich grounds upon which to examine the audience's intent, some of which is captured and integrated into the production of the document itself. As the author, my lantern reveals much about my interlocutor to me and to those who have actually  charitably + thoroughly (insofar as they can even be peeled apart) interpreted the author's intent as well.

All else being equal, it is fascistic to deny a moral right to a political right to tell someone they are being fascistic because it would hurt their feelings.
