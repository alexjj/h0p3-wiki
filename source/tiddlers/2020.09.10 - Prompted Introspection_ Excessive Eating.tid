title: 2020.09.10 - Prompted Introspection: Excessive Eating

!! What area of your life do you tend to enjoy in excess instead of moderation?

Lmao. I'm not a moderate person. I don't fucking trust moderate people in most cases. I'm extremely black or white, even in how I aim to describe or prescribe grayness. I enjoy exaggeration, and I milk all the tits that I adore as far as I can. Obviously, the golden mean of virtue is hardly in the middle in many contexts. There are places that I'm obviously excessive where I shouldn't be but also wish I wasn't. 

Food. I eat too much, and I don't eat the right kind. I'm a glutton. It's shameful how much I eat. Since I was teenager, I've done this wrong. Some doctors say "yeah, you could lose some weight" (and some are overly polite when they say I'm fine), but I know I'm overweight. My belly is round. I eat because it tastes good and makes my belly feel good, and I don't stop to ask myself if I'm really hungry (or if anyone else is either). It's another one of my drugs. It would be wiser if I would always feel a little bit hungry. It would be wiser if I ate more vegetables and fruit in place of what I prefer. Feels like I always lose control of this one.
