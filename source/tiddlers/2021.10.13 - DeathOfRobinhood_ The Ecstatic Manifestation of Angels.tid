I knew you would like that. =)
All I could think at the time was what you were gonna think about it. j
How's life going, sir?
Oh hey!
Yo!

You are all good, [[DeathOfRobinhood]]. You are a busy dad. There's never enough time.
!!!
Ahhhh. She is adorable.
She looks warm too. How is she?
Im doing well. Finishing a poop, watching the youngun
Noice.
Any more of her personality peeking out?
Oh, that's so fun
I think so
She likes to talk. And wait her turn. Smile and reply.
Very physically active. She was standing, leaning on the couch seat, by herself this morning
She's usually very content and curious
But when she cries
She turns all red
And shakes violently
She can be very loud
Very strong feelings. Important to get them out.
Her voice is actually really low for a baby
Think she'll have that voice fry?
She sounds like...a grown woman with a low voice trying to sound like a baby
She'll be a baritoness for sure
She'll have the voice fry if we listen to a lot of npr together :P
She's very young for knowing words, but has she understood any symbols?
How are you doing?
I don't know. Selah's beginning some sign language work
I'm doing well. My grind is simple enough. [[ASK]] may be coming to live with us here soon, so the house is filling up.
Your daughter may be exceptionally multi-lingual.
How do added persons affect your grind? If at all?
We'll see. Selah is speaking French to her. My mom speaks Mandarin. I'd just like her to be fluent in English!
Comprehension and expression.
I don't know. Probably will be different for each person.
She's a lucky girl.
I'd like to look up [[ASK]] on your wiki. I am not drawing any immediate associations
But first, I will shower!
Yes, sir. `/salute`.
Oh, you're amazing
As crazy as they come.
We need more crazy like you
At least some people do.
