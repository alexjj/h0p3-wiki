Even if I were somehow lucky enough to find a sufficient answer to capitalism, I'm not convinced anyone is going to listen to me (except maybe the Amazon piss bottle cleaners), let alone actually do anything about it. I'm still going to try. I have to have [[hope]] that people are going to give a shit, [[ridtyawtr]]. Meanwhile, I'll enjoy National Pornographic in my suite life.

Seems like inflation is already here for what we really need to buy.

Beware fighting with a manchild such as myself because (a) I drink the dumbfuck brainhurting juice and (b) I have an unlimited supply of Dunning-Kruger fueled illusory superiority and suppressed narcissistic rage that I can access at any point in time (usually funneled into a verbose, monotone, socially inept, autistic screeching), no matter how calm I seem. Please add people like me to the list of things that can destroy the world (currently, as of this week: coughing, gamestonk, apathy, and a boat).

Globalization increased the correlation coefficient between all major asset classes, requiring both more brokered backroom relationships with elite parasites and riskier pursuits of illiquid assets for uncorrelated returns.

Do not conflate underdeveloped with overexploited.

Who controls The Stack? Every capable person (which is far more inclusive than most would want to admit) must understand, create, and audit the software and laws of their society. There is no functioning decentralization of power nor a true democracy without a good faith attempt from at least most of the population. We must be living tools toward what matters most. Tools aren't mere tactical processes for the sake of convenience; the preservation of our agency requires selecting the right tools again and again, including those that enable us to fork as much of The Stack both technically and socially as possible. Sometimes, we should not make up for deficiencies in one tool with another, but instead we must replace it wholesale. There is a middleground by which tools can be maintained by end users to some significant [[dok]] without live support from authors and experts. Perhaps we can trim complexity budgets to fit a sufficient percentage of our personal ecosystems into a single brain, especially if we can reward curiosity for understanding internals. We must seek software so simple that perhaps we must accept greater limitations on our feasible goals in order to inspire au fait creativity and first-hand working knowledge of a living democratic system.
