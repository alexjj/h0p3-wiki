`/schizorant on`

Most people think I'm not trying to be reasonable in this space. I think it's the other way around. 

Looking at a phone for my wife. After half a decade, hers is garbage at this point (in some senses, it has served her really well for a $100 phone). Unfortunately, LineageOS isn't ready for the latest moto G phones (I suppose I could make it work myself, but why work on a thing that is still Android-ecosystem-shitstained at the core?). Might have to go pixel, might just go for an older phone (seems fine). Won't be touching 5G, despite the fact that technically there are a handful of towers in our state (range aint good enough). She needs a rooted phone better than stock. I'm not going to ask her to own her device here (though I've tried to convince her many times, she's an extremely busy mom and librarian working her ass off to keep her head above water and the family afloat while trying to save the world in the ways she knows how she has since she was quite young -- naw, she's done her part). Anyway, I remembered that it wasn't just her phone that needed some updatin'. Mine did too. 

Alright, so I decided to work on mine since my battery is shot, and I've been holding off on working on it since we've moved, etc. I'm privileged enough to live on my PC rather than my phone. As far as mainstream phones go, [[monster-14]], my Moto G5 Plus, has done alright for a long time. I fucking hate my phone, of course. Always have. You can't function in a society (we do be livin in one) without it though (and I've tried carrying around a netbook everywhere for a long time). All of my previous phones were designed to have replaceable batteries (and our Samsung even had a custom brick-like attachment that made it last for days [reminds me of the good ol' gameboy hardware mods]). And, yes this a right to repair issue. So, onto it:

I had to heat the screen up to get it off. 3 kinds of screws when there only should have been 1, without easy differentiation (needed a camera to know where they belonged), and there was no need for 18 screws. They stripped too easily, even with the correct tools. Speaking of which: the ghetto kit I got came with terrible tools (and only double-sided adhesive for the battery, while lacking cover plates (not sure how well the screen is going to stay on long-term), and I'm lucky I have my own set. Had to try to rubberband the last one, but no go. Thankfully, I didn't have to actually remove the motherboard (though most do apparently). Disconcertingly, the power switches on WITHOUT touching a button. Hrm, that's not good, Yogi. All this said, the port connectors were the absolute cleanest I've ever worked with on a phone (unfortunately, that doesn't mean they function, even if they are fun to use). These were seemingly designed to be taken on and off (thank you, except, it didn't work...maybe just my phone though). I'm not convinced battery replacement was meant to be done by the average joe. Moto is about as cheap and open as a mainstream mobile device gets (don't read any conversational implicature into that sentence, please [that shit was never //my// device in the first place; including the diverse set of roots on my system embedded in the turing-turtles all the way down, it's just a loss-leader anti-democratic surveillance infection point trying to hook children on convenient black-skinnerbox crack reinforced by nearly every sociopolitical vector in our lives {you see why I consider working on this futile, right?}]).

Bad news: touch screen isn't working at all now. I've had this phone for a long time, and it's been having power-based touchscreen problems for half a year. Last ditch effort to save it. Old battery has the problem now too. So, it's either the screen or the motherboard. Ordered a screen to see if I can salvage it. If I can't, UGH! I was lazily hoping to sit on this one for a few more years until I could replace it with a real GNU/Linux system (be still, my heart). My timetable might be moving up, but I think not still. 

There are two routes I've been looking at since they came out: Librem/Pine and GPD Pocket (buckets of cum for these). 

Besides some actual fucking hardware hax or a dongle, you can't get a sim card to work on the GPD-like micro-PCs. It's a fucking shame. Their ~~engineers~~ project managers and above, ~~geniuses though~~ sociopaths they may be, need to be fucking shot. You could have destroyed so much of the problem, you know that, right? I'm here bitchin' about it yet again. It was so close! It's off the table (or you just carry two devices) until they wake up. Ofc, that shit is expensive. I buy used laptops exclusively, just like cars. As a moral matter, a $500 machine better be the second cumming of Christ as far as I'm concerned. It could have been that good.

So, I've been dancing around the pinephone, especially because it's almost cheap (I live on dirt cheap phones). I was hoping that I could maybe make it my daily driver. Seen enough to know that it's slower than fuck no matter what DE you use. Understandably, the chips are old, and more problematically, the GNU/Linux GUI userspace has never been ready for a touchscreen (I'd wager it's only in the past decade that it's really become a worthy GUI desktop for an intermediate-level user like me, and only with work). Headless Linux is dope, specialized embedded's reasonable enough, but for erryday general purpose computing, I still have trouble with sound, graphics, power, and wireless in 2021 (I've been using BSD and Linux since the 90s). Advanced touchpad, highly custom keyboard software control, and stylus functionality in Linux probably won't ever catch up at this rate (I hope I'm wrong, and it's certainly not the fault of non-capitalists actually using and making GNU/Linux). X is never really going to be replaced, right? Getting a high-functioning, reliable system on a potato is asking for miracles. I'll take non-trivial inconvenience (my time according to the powerful and their rootkit infected reactionaries was worthless anyways); it's worth working on systems that fight capitalists (the workers must own the means of production, and this is an unfun part of taking those means).

Look, I think it's already a pain in the ass to get a great Linux Desktop experience (even [[monster-16]] has plenty of problems I couldn't be arsed to fix). Don't get me wrong: even after setting aside the political concerns, I still can't get Windows to do what I need it to do (and given WSL1's failure, I don't think I could in the end). There just isn't an obvious low-hanging fruit answer for me. Currently, I use ridiculous computing resources to overcome the flaws in my barely functioning system. I think the real hackers in the past half century would be disgusted by my wastefulness and laziness. Having a mobile device feels so infeasible sometimes (and, I love the losers working this space: I believe in you, even if I don't believe in myself). If it was never the year of the GNU/Linux Desktop, will it ever be the year of the GNU/Linux phone?

Anbox has always been a pile of shit (and along with all their other sins, that's also Google's fault [along with many others]), but I know I'll miss the basic Android ecosystem (stockholm syndrome, I know). But, what do I really need? Maps, SMS, Phone, Browser, terminal with root privileges, and...imho: x64. I've used RPis since gen1, and while it's a turing complete machine, it's not general purpose in many practical senses. I need a device that just runs all the devices, allowing me to step down into a lower-privileged quasi-virtual environment for convenience (or sometimes the only possible application that exists for the matter).

So, brass tacks, here's the practical {[[dream]]}, losers: I want a shrunk-down detachable 2-in-1 (Pinephone is already adding the extra battery life to their keyboard, making it a 2-in-1) with all-in-one hetero multi-architecture x64 and ARM (I despise saying that Apple has ever done anything right, and the slivers in any of us that like Apple have always been wrong). I think it's the only way to attempt to offset Google's radical control over the space. I consider Android x86 VMs to be abysmal. At this rate, it's better to run multiple native systems side-by-side on a single device. I don't even have this capacity on my desktop, let alone something as resource starved as a phone. Still looks like nation-state level actor problems to solve to me. No market is going to give rise to the answer. 

For all I fucking care, have the x64 system on the keyboard itself, quasi headless. Give me hardware security switches and resource sharing options, maybe even a wireless connection between the two. Native docking and hardware routers would be noice. Make it so I can migrate over time, have a hardware firewall between the systems, wrap and isolate Android hardware and software blob garbage. But, even x64 isn't really trustworthy in the end. The rabbithole never ends. Still looks like nation-state level actor problems to solve to me. No market is going to give rise to the answer (but now, perhaps it is better just to accept ARM for now [it has vastly improved, and there's reason to think it will continue] and use those resources to have a real GNU/Linux ARM space).

I have no idea how to be practically wise at any scale here, and I don't know anyone who does. We need a digital Moses to help us cross. I'm pretty fucking worried. We have too many problems that have to be solved all at once (this is just one small one among all that I see), and I don't know anyone who wants to think about it altogether. There's a dozen postmodern problematics at work. I don't see why the handful of innocents that will arise out of future generations should forgive us. 

Do you see why I'm on the hunt, folks? I'm looking for an answer. I only find fragments in people, at best. I feel lonely about it too. Lost as always. It's so expensive to give a AF, [[hope]]less feeling, overwhelming. It's tragic.

`/schizorant off`

So, anyway, I'm still thinking about what to do about this phone. I'm very [[grateful]] that I have food to eat and roof over my head.

I like my desktop. It helps me get my shit done. Maybe I need to make my own. 

NixOS sounds like a great fit here. If you are going to do it from near scratch, why not?
