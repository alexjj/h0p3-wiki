title: 2020.05.17 - Family Log: The break

!! Write a paragraph summarizing each person's week given the wikis:

* [[1uxb0x]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I didn't really do anything in my wiki. I think I mainly played games and yes, I am partially a consol pleb. I think I'm going to have trouble bouncing back into work. I did predict this. I think my room is a mess, and that I'm used to having a mess, doesn't mean it's okay though, in fact quite the opposite.
** j3d1h
*** You need to chill. You didn't end the world this week, just messed up a bit. Bounce back into school, and everything should be fine. It's good you owned up to it in your wiki review, and thought about what should be done. Your thoughts are still too pessimistic there, though.
** k0sh3k
*** I do think you're right that you probably need more accountability to keep on track with core daily requirements during breaks. Next time, I might require a set time for wiki-work while on break. I hate that you didn't keep track of what you did this week - what games you played, who you talked to, planting the garden, etc. I think those are things you would want to be able to look back on in a year and remember. 
** h0p3
*** [[1uxb0x]] consumed a lot of [[vidya]] [[games]] on his break. Generally, he lived in his room. Many nights, he stayed up late into the next morning binging. It sounds like he met some cool dudes online. //SCP: Secret Laboratory// and //Blackwake// seemed to be his drugs of choice. He still did his public chores, but skipped his [[CDR]]s and cleaning his room. He got some gardening done too; he tilled soil with his dad and planted with his sister. He had a good week.

* [[j3d1h]]
** 1uxb0x
*** Your prompted introspections and antipleonasm analyses were pretty good this week. You probably will have another break. It's interesting that there is a laungauge the author of 1984 made. You worked on your wiki this week even though you weren't going to be held accountable until today. Overall a good week!
** j3d1h
*** "Pressure makes diamonds, people" was a good pick. Many of the quotes I picked were good ones, actually! I liked writing last Sunday's prompted introspection, it was an interesting question. I should still make the calendar-shifting script. We've already changed the dates quite a few times.
** k0sh3k
*** I like your Prompted Introspection for last Sunday (Good and Good); I like that you thought not only of the questions but also why those are good questions and how you should ask them. There are still a lot of duplicate/empty tiddlers popping up early in the week. I find it curious that you are quicker to answer prompted introspections and do antipleonasm analyses than you are to record your life logs; why is that? I think you misinterpreted Gibran in your antipleonasm analysis for 5/15; he wasn't saying he loves others when/because they worship a god or gods, but that all religions are essentially one religion, so that fighting based on religion is wrong. I think he's very wrong, still, but not for the reasons you've listed. Please remember that the various names of religious groups are proper nouns and should be capitalized (Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, etc.); likewise, when referring to the Christian deity, "God" is treated as a name and is therefore capitalized. (In most other religions, capitalization is reserved for that god's given name - Vishnu, Ra, Allah, etc.) 
** h0p3
*** [[j3d1h]] had a good week off. She drew, animated, and RPed. She got to spend more time with her friends. Like a true weirdo, she chose to read in her spare time, and she once again has a lot of dumb questions about language systems related to //1984// that she should never attempt to systematically answer (this is, ofc, doubleunacceptacleez because she is a female). She generated the final organization of the primary garden and planted. What surprised me the most this week was that she passed an important first half of a test. We let her fly, and she still chose to write (and, gold, at that). Her [[Antipleonasm Analysis]] and [[Prompted Introspection]]'s are too often better than mine. Go on and blast off.

*** You finally made the book club! Chicken and waffles with honey were (suprisingly,) good! I would like to eat it again but I am suprised my sister doesn't like it. It's sad you had to work almost the whole week, while a majority of our time was free. It's great that your making a rosary too!
** j3d1h
*** Chicken and waffles with honey legitimately tastes bad. Your prompted introspection on the 12th is interesting. I think I missed a few of the steps you took, but your point is great! Over all, your wiki this week is around the same amount, I think. I'm sorry you had to work this week while everyone else got time off. :)
** k0sh3k
*** I am glad I finally made my book club, and that I planned it to only meet six times a year, so it's not likely to be too stressful. I think I picked a good topic for our first round of books; I hope everyone that's joined likes the format and it doesn't fizzle out like my other book clubs have done. I really like my prompted introspection for Tuesday. May 12 is officially the most boring day on the calendar. I liked my RCL and AFF for the week; this is the first time in a while that I haven't cribbed by AFF from past RCLs. 
** h0p3
*** [[k0sh3k]] has had many meetings. Unfairly, even with hax, she did not get much of a break this week like the rest of her family. Iron supplements are hurting her stomach again. She's like a goth fairy treant nun when she writes. She's been extra excited about her new book club (hint: don't join it, it's only for losers), in which, and I shit you not: a bunch of librarians/adjacents are going to read about books related to book clubs. I want to listen to their conversation like a freerider (we will mute my schreeeching, and I might have a bingo-term drinking-game set up). She's been making rosaries, and I want to put them in my mouth. I'm worried about her stress. I was happy to watch some shows with her this week.

* [[h0p3]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I'm not saying your wrong in your worries, you've known about Covid-19 from before a lot of people did. I'm glad we've planted the garden. You need to have a good sleep schedule, you just sleep randomly, at 10 or at 3. Also, don't eat moms rosary, thats disgusting.
** j3d1h
*** I think you've been very productive over the break. Do you really think you didn't get enough done? The letters you asked me to check out look good, but I don't know if you're asking me to find something in particular. azl is an interesting fellow, but your conversation so far is awfully asynchronous! Hopefully, you get to talk to these people closer to real-time, at some point?
** k0sh3k
*** I dislike your prompted introspection for last Sunday (Simple Snakes) and think you should answer the question for realsies. Also, you don't even own a Spiderman costume, so how am I supposed to take any of that seriously? It seems you spent a lot of this break putting conversations into your wiki. Some of your friends are supercool; I like gh057 a lot - tell him I said hello and ask how his wife is doing. If this year's garden doesn't work b/c the soil sucks, maybe next year we should try raised/box gardening? Dickenson is underrated as a poet; everyone thinks her all Victorian and proper, but she fits in well with the Weird. I like when the kids decide what we'll eat; maybe two nights a week should be theirs to decide - it'll help them learn how to plan an entire meal and figure out how much they need to make for a number of people. That spinning backfist is a good move; I'll have to practice it some more. Your sleep schedule has been all over the place; do you want to normalize it? 
** h0p3
*** [[h0p3]] had a good week. Lots of thinking, some reading and writing, and plenty of chill time. He got some work done still, but he vegged.  [[APonting]] has required quite a bit of digestion. Also, [[h0p3]]'s been reaching out to lots of people. He connected with [[BL]] too, a pleasant surprise. [[Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden]] is planted, though who knows what will arise. There is much to do.
