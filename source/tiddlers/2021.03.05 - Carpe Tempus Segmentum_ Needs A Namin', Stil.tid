title: 2021.03.05 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Needs A Namin', Stil

Woke at 3, took a piss, glanced at [[m16]] (force of habit), could not sleep again, ruminations and racing for hours. Fireman Time! seals it though. Thank you, penis. 

Grabbed some risotto, someone made cookies in the middle of the night (and if she didn't finish her computer work to help her uncle, that would be fine with me, distractions that are still reasonably constructive). 

Writing in a shiny new workspace.

[[TTTOTW]]. BabeOfBlasphemy HMU again. I'm surprised (at this rate, we'll be good friends in a decade). She's ultra slow to respond, but I'm too, I get it (I'm an afterthought, maybe, perhaps it just takes time). No [[New]]/[[Recent]] for her to bootstrap herself in, it will have to be wandering or a close examination of [[Readme]] topics to find other ways. That girl is hardcore, adore it. I think her narcissism is well contained and in no small part a product of that BPD transmutation and sponging up of the clear dark triadicism in her ex (with a fascinating family to boot). I do find her ego hawt (she spits trufe), no way around it. I hope to be of use to her. I like that she hates men, but not me (well, not yet* lol, right?). 

Meow and I annoyed our woman. She's tired. I hope she'll nap when she gets home. 

Shaved my head and beard. My son finished the job (can't do my own neckline on the back). Feels much better. Set offspring onto tasks, my daughter is pissed at me again, for the same reasons. `/mutual-deep-breath` (god damn do we love each other).

LoLvods + [[TTTOTW]]

Nap. Hit me hard. Then, but, of course, Fireman Time!

More cleaning, laundry. [[TTTOTW]]

Hugs'n'bugs. They both have something, but not enough. Glad to see her on [[m10]] (forget the new name...). I hope it helps you {[[Focus]]}. It's not easy, I know.

Attempted to fill NRG tank with the syringes I have. Ugh. Nope. Just enough to maybe cover half the coils though (gonna need to work that into place).

7 ounces of Cherry Wine Trim decarbed, 30oz of MCT, couple tsps of that sunflower lecithin, heavily mixed. Difficult to have enough liquid for this. Messy and I did a very poor job. I lack a decent chinois, or something similar. A press, one day.

Her keyboard finally arrived. Tested the hardware; it's real. Installing arch. Trying out this: https://github.com/MatMoul/archfi - less typing, no doubt. Still didn't install everything it needed for networking. Not turnkey, but I like it.

Router update and changes. Gonna do this on my machine.

//Skintime// + Thinking About Days + Assisted Fireman Time! High AF.

Made beef and used the leftovers. LoLvod too. Pure trash.

Long conversation with Scout. Continue to explore the family as it has morphed and clarified since he last sustained saw. Continuing to think about the grander stories we can find. Still thinking about [[kicks]]' letter. We both were so wonderfully struck by that "brittle little shit" line.<<ref "y">> It made my day.

Bartered with my offspring. My kitchen, and you think about magic with me in an expensive research-oriented dialectical manner. Without restriction, they wanted to perfect MUC and Affinity, and we, yet again, arrived at Storm and Stax. Went well.

Kitchen.
