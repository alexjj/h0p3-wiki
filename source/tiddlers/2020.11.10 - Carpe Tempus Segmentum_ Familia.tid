title: 2020.11.10 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Familia

* Read+Write
* Fireman Time! x2
* Read+Watch
* VC with [[AIR]]
** He was checkin' to see how I'm doing. [[JRE]] has been worried too.
** Thinking about the job offer.
** Wants a hallucinogen. I offered to mail some off, but he doesn't want any.
*** THC lollipops failed to taste good, sadly. First time, eh. Probably worth researching quite a bit more, maybe even getting in contact with some shops that do it well. 
** Walked through the housing consideration.
* Prep for dinner
* Sleep by 4:30
* Woke at 1:30
** Fuck yeah. Gorgeous sleep.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Perhaps good news on //The Asylum// negotiation. Still waiting.
* Bugged my wife thinking about her work. 
** My wife has been mimicking her management class everywhere (on top of higher rates of fucking with me...<3).
** Presentation went well! A surprising hiccup in her scheduling that she caught last minute. She is lucky she is so talented and works so hard otherwise to be able to throw that together so fast.
* [[Fitness Routine]] with offspring
** Apparently, I had detected someone was on her period within 3 minutes. Success.
* Walk With Offspring
** So much easier when I don't have to ask about whether or not they are doing the right thing in their primary work.
** A lot of gorgeous asses on the trail today.
** Daughter is complaining about RAM usage (and laughed at my inefficiency). Living within 8GB is hell, yes, maam. If she was going to do her schoolwork, I'd aim for whatever machine she needed. I often tell my offspring that throwing more hardware at the problem is one of the first major steps to take at a consumer level (programming is hard :P).
*** Walked through computer history and talked shit about Electron. It was a good day with the young ones.
* Read
* Made sure dinner was set
* //Skintime// -> Literally Inform the Men!
** Making fun of me because I'm struggling to get off the 4th time in half a day. There is a decline. 
* Meditation
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Stirfry and a beer
*** I thought we made way too much at first, but it turned out to be just a bowl or two more than we needed. Teenagers eat a lot.
** [[MTG]], girls played and guys played
*** [[j3d1h]]'s Affinity vs [[k0sh3k]]'s Pacifism +2, two games. They each took one down.
*** My son played MUC +2 vs Goblins, and he damn near took it. Lots of errors, but quadruple piledrivers off of jiki hacks squeaked it out. 
*** My son played Goblins vs MUC +2. I toyed with my food for 15 turns. Basically a hardlock from t5. Wish->Whispers of the Muse was gorgeous (been a long time since I abused that card). Reminds me that I should grab another capsize. I'd like to just finish the deck off perfectly. Glad I sold off my FoWs, but that deck really feels the difference without them.
* Called [[JRE]] Back
** Thrush is cleared up!
** Lucid dreaming. He's been super tired.
*** Took Matthew to the airport and zoo because if he stayed home he'd have fallen asleep.
*** Unable to keep both children quiet through the workday, understandably.
** Visitation problems. Seems more pessimistic about biomom's odds of taking Quinn back, even with whatever help he can provide.
** Offered to come stay in January. I can't leave right now because of the move, but I can see some relief would be useful for them.
** Baby poop stories
** Islam and epistemic foundation, he says we've talked about it a million times. Yup.
*** Said he was thinking about writing his thoughts down. Cool!
** Offered VR to offspring. I think he should keep it and continue building out downstairs. I think my offspring have enough digital drugs as it is too.
*** Talked about maybe getting a CNC machine and 3d printer, hates making jigs for woodworking, laughed about how all his Youtubers only build things for their shop but never make anything else.
* //Skintime// + //Star Trek: Discovery//
** Per [[AIR]]'s recommendation, we are giving it another shot.
* //Fool Us// + Read+Write

Am I blissed out? I must be stupid. Have it just sitting there. Hasn't been calling to me. Been looking at jobs too. Much better position in the city, no doubt. If my offspring are not going to use me, which is insane, then maybe I can be useful elsewhere.
