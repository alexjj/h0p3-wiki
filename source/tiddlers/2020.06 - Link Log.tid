!! Audit:

* This has become more relaxing. 
** I'm growing desensitized to 2020. Just pile this shit on, I guess.
** I've felt pretty trapped in the flood too. I'm glad to have some breathing space to catalog. 
* I'm glad to see some //Stunning!//s and //Preach, yo!//s. 
* My definition of //Tools// continues to expand.
* I feel like the overall [[Link Log]] has become more well-rounded ([[WINTCIS]]). 
* I feel like MacKenzie McHale (though she's a fucking 10) in picking out what I think an informed electorate should be exposed to, or at least a source of sources. We have very different concepts of authority though.
* I feel like I need to collect treasure chests from strange anons and digest them. There aren't a lot of people who this kind of work who have significant overlap with me (=/).
