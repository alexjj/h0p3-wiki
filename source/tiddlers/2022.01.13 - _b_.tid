I don't predict I'll discover any deep results or deep theorems in my work (though I'm skeptical that there is such a thing to be had in philosophy these days, and that may be why it is considered dead in some respects). I think I'm routing and synthesizing hybrid topics to find practical answers. Looking for applied philosophy and building machinery. I think one of the primary issues is that I have too many topics to learn to form a better answer.

While it encodes much of my thinking in multiple senses, I don't think I merely allow the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 to remember most of my thinking in the way in which a painting is its own schematic that allows the artist to isolate the layers and outlines without having to conceptualize the whole the entire time. Without losing that ability, I am trying to think about and re-represent the whole thing (and more) while I work on it, [[WINTCIS]].

Unfortunately, I tell a very long tale to tired and hungry people. Who has time for that? Though, I'm convinced that to some non-trivial [[dok]], dramatic tension requires I wait. I'm bad at it. In any case, I prefer my antagonist to be a circumstance rather than a person.

[[Wiki Audit]]: maybe the H-book's wielding of color was correct. [[Greentext]], [[My Rainbow]], [[cancelled]], Retroactive [[Footnotes]]s, [[Wiki Mechanics]] of these sort that maybe have a future.
