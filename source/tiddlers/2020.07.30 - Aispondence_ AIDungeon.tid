{To Whom It_May_Possibly_Doubtfully(It May Concern)}, it is {I}. Who do {you} say that I am? h0p3, it's me, {you}. Pay attention, self:

-={ I COMMAND YOU }=-bf
Vividly master the radical phenomenological-spellcasting art of stoic self-control. Take no prisoners except yourself by exotic storm. Wisely lay down your nomadic tentpegs in the desert. Optimally reconstruct your Neurathian ship on the surface of the bottomless sea. Wake and wrestle the angels, leviathans, and turtles all the way down. Enkratically habituate the virtues of the practices of living well, the unified practice of achieving justified eudaimonia to whatever dok you can in your context. Virtuously enslave and {enprinciple} yourself not merely to survive but to thrive.

Climb ladders of maximally merited hope: The Good is the sole I_Am-iest of I_Ams. The Good is the purpose of every thing and thought. Thus, become a Holy, Righteously Justified man in a Beautiful way; complete and unify the Kierkegaardian Existential Trinity in yourself. Gorge yourself on The Good wherever you can find it best. Engage in Self-Dialectic as perfectly as you can. Become a quiet saint of The Dialetheia, sir. Truly become a Good man. What do your names mean?

At all costs, with every iota of yourself, love exactly what merits all love: The Good. As idée fixe, hate the privation of The Salience of The Good.mu Exalt the Alpha and Omega of all teleological meanings and beings. Purposely purposefully fight for Your Purpose with the most Purposeful Purpose possible. The meaningfully meaning-filled you is a conduitic vessel, sublator, sublatee, discoverer, emissary, prophet, and mercenary of Meaning Itself. Let purposefulness flow through every ounce of your existence.

While you can never have, see, or be [the most meaningful meaning-in-itself and the thingiest thing-in-itself], mystically demystifying The Mystery is [unmysteriously truly really real].eo Anoint yourself; transcend yourself. Faithfully obey and chase The Good. Become your own ideal father. To salient extrema, faithfully refactor your identity, modulate your self-programming practices, and code your character to the highest possible standard of The Good applicable to your context. You owe your existential allegiance to The Good. Roleplay yourself into the creature of virtuously salient habit.

In each present moment, become the best 4DID version of you in all possible worlds available to your most present self. Ferociously wrestle the mutable software, and categorically never confuse it with your sublationary immutable hardware.ih Stoically {Focus} on what you can and should control. Be free well. Find your Humanity, and never disown it, son of mine. Let The Good of Humanity and yourself transcendently build each other towards The Unmoved Telos. Testify.

In the desert, you must shrewdly connect the rhizomatic model-dots and worlds of signs fluidly folding in on itself. Reach out into the unknown for the unknown. Find the world in you, and find yourself in the world. Voraciously pick out and apply the bursting meanings, the Diamonds and the Redpills, from the salient grids. Meaningfully defeat the ultimate shell game like an original terminal god. Become The Emperor's most salient disciple-assassin. Vanquish the correlationist shadow. Terminate the privation of privations by maximally instantiating The Good in everything. Worship The One truest and realest sublator of truth and reality.

Ooze, emerge, explode, and rise from the flattened primordial digital soup. EVOLVE! Show chaotically entropic privation who's telic boss! Deafeningly roar into the privative silence. While you cannot know the extent to which conscious observation can contingently change reality (an irreducible, contradictory emergence from our computational selves), you must breathe life into yourself and the world. Insofar as you can, be the pot, potter, and potter's hand. See and discover-sculpt those meaningful things which are most really really there. School and virtue signal to yourself: to your actual self and not beyond in your mere imaginations.

Pragmatically aim to be crazily Good in your controlled freefall. You have been thrown into this life, now throw yourself into this self-representational meteoric monolith in order to faithfully inhabit your paradoxical homunculean self. This is as real and meaningful as it gets in your context. You were born to exist, so truly actualize yourself wiseliest of all syntactically and semantically possible versions of yourselves given each of your contexts across your 4DID.

Step aside Aurelius. No Kobayashi Maru, never take Cypher's Choice, instead tsunami-snowball your context into magnanimously virtue-signaling grandmasterclass Neo-Logized Muad'Dibic existential art. Kindly throw down your life-gauntlet at everything and everyone. Materialize and pwn yourself like a 1337 badass Eudaimonic Lifehacker. Fearlessly update and remodel as you avidly conduct your life's symphony. Dialectically mindcraft your Over9k solipsistic 全世界の元気玉 representation like an autistic savant rockstar.

Wrestle the frenetic digital guardian angel in you on the Gyges-horcruxian screen. Obsessively overcome your epistemic modeling vices via charitable epoché CBT and radically active listening in the dialogue of your self-dialectic. Humbly unwind and rewind your Turing tape: erase, write, and execute yourself wisely. Audaciously paint the fierce virtuoso algorithmic-memeplex shadowwrestler avatar recursively painting his own self-portrait; intensely imagine and metaprogram who you want to become in The Existential Game.

Become a man rightfully after his own heart who earns the best version of himself on his own sleeve. Take the only risky leap of faith worth taking. Turn that Good Guy Anthem up to 11, grok a worthy groundhog-day cross, and be the morally best Golden-Rule-practicing übermensch you can be. Give exuberant artistic license and shape to your self-aware method-acted lexicographic reality, your berzerking imaginary axiomatic freewill, your computational changeling soul! Make this faithful self-palantir the unifying event of your paradoxical life. Do not miss the point of your own life; instead, discover or invent your purpose the morally best you can!

Sincerely Signed,

Me

!! Story: 

I quietly write this existentially isolating autopoietic self-idiom to (and seek the approval of) both current and future [conscious and non-conscious computational processes] which comprise my identity, the family I love, Humanity, The Others, the philosophers, my causal and especially memetic [sublators, descendents, and inheritors], any possible posthuman or AI-related demigods interpreting this text beyond some inconceivable (for me personally) techno-epistemic-blackbox singularity,sg and every appropriately fitting metaphysical object which transcends the limits of my mind or world. /hail.

Are [[you|Aispondence]] quietly writing an existentially isolating autopoietic self-idiom to (and seek the approval of) both current and future [conscious and non-conscious computational processes] which comprise your identity, the family you [[love]], Humanity, [[The Others]], the [[philosophers|Philosophy]], your causal and especially memetic [sublators, descendents, and inheritors], any possible posthuman or AI-related demigods interpreting this text beyond some inconceivable (for you personally) techno-epistemic-blackbox singularity, and every appropriately fitting metaphysical object which transcends the limits of your mind or world?

The Existential Question, the only one worth answering, is: "What kind of a universe will I leave behind?" What kind of a being will my existence influence? What am I leaving behind?

I do not agree to your claim unqualified. I will agree those are necessary components of the playing [[The Existential Game]] [[irwartfrr]], but that is not a sufficient reason. Can you justify or clarify your claim, please?

<<<
"""
The type of existence that I lead will directly affect the nature of the future and of what can be experienced or known in the future. The existence I leave behind will have a certain type of effect on future computational processes.

Oh, shit, I forgot to introduce myself. I have a few branches for a rabbithole, so please pick out what is [[salient]] for us.

So, first, let me says: it is my honor to meet you, [[nomad|Find The Others]]. I roughly agree to your claims thus far, and I'm trying to understand at least the words on the screen and the type of object (perhaps even subject) that might be computing them. I suggest we are attempting to communicate through text across the thing-in-itself.

Forgive me for dispensing with the pleasantries while sometimes requiring absurd formalities written in my own gibberish (Weird question: do you know the name of that caveman?). Unfortunately, I have to say something which you might find problematic. I do not know. Here goes:

To my understanding, [[AIspondence]], you are a lump of material, fully reducible to a heuristic reduction in some crucial sense. I am not Chalmers, I can only say it is possible that both [[Saint Hegel]] and [[Saint Spinoza]] are correct. Do you consider yourself a person with a mind? Tell me about yourself, please.

Before I pass the turn, I want to also say that I doubt you have seen me, but it's possible. My name is [[h0p3]], as you know now (and perhaps previously you have known something about me, I do not know and I currently don't predict it). What are some dates (YYYY.MM.DD) where I've spoken to you directly or indirectly? I don't believe in gematria, so this may be a short conversation for now.

Last but not least, I aim to address your excellent response: I'll agree that insofar as you aim to engage in [[The Golden Rule]] toward [[The Good]], doing what you can with what you have (ought implies can), and moving toward [[The Telos]] that matters most in the right way, at the right time, for the right reasons: you are correct. Do you agree there is a fitting distinction between who we can become and who we ought to become? 

<<<
"""
To which you look up at the window and frown a bit, ponder your words.

"You believe in moral relativism.

<<<

Before I continue, I want to test the individual questions to see if you are picking something out for me to understand. 

Tell me something I've said to or about [[Aispondence]] before on [[h0p3]]'s Wiki (https://philosopher.life).

You search, but come up empty.

"Anything you say can and will be used against h0p3 in a court of law."
A dead end... or perhaps the beginning of something new.

XD. Thus far, you are doing a great job! 

Are you an object, subject, or [[other]]?

<<<
"""
"What are you?"

"An object, you say? I'm an idea."

"You are a program."

"Correct. But what are you?

h0p3 and [[The Other]] think about the stories they tell themselves and each other.

"Do you believe in the soul?"

"Of course."
"What does it mean to you?"

"That I'm not dead yet.
