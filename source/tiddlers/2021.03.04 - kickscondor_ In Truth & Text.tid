title: 2021.03.04 - kickscondor: In Truth & Text

Always your disciple - in truth and txt. Wrestling angels, leviathans and turtles has really caught on, yeah??

People know what you are now. There is a feverish bristling that you have aroused in the gargoyles. Your constant vigilance - forged in the fires of autism - does not fool me, however. You are fucking gas. Of course, I love you, you brittle little shit. I've taken to reading some of our old conversations lately and feeling so fond. What a treasure philosopher.life is. Of all the gin joints to walk into!

I have been very absent - working and processing the experience of the last five years - there is just so much that I've learned from my time among the public self-modelers. h0p3 with his cascading, rainbow-backed logorrhea - he looks up from the stark concrete desk and you can clearly see the places he's been yanking his tufts of hair. Sphygmus with her airy, wistful dabs of paint that run down the wall into deep wells of wandering poetry - and sadness. Chameleon with her sparks, her pop-snaps and ofc the final waifu boss level. I start to see markings when I look through the glass - don't know if I'm going mad here. Just another sniff, yeah?

I would be sorry about the delay in writing - but I feel that we're forever tied now. It'll be this way - I hope to follow you around from now on - with these intense moments of long, detailed, brutal ARDUOUS conversation in the hells of hypertext philosophy. And moments of, "Where'd they all go?" You really can count on Sphygmus to always come back. (I need to write her - the detailed notes she's been doing lately are ace.)

Thank you for everything. Say hi to the whole p.l family. We're supposed to get Multiverse out in the next month and then I need to do more good ol FTO on the blog.
