title: 2020.10.03 - Wiki Review: 4 Years

* [[2020.10.02 - Prompted Introspection: Buying Energy]]

**** I like how I engage in philosophy now way more too. It's not something that almost anyone else will care for, sadly, but I like the moves I've made.

** I forgot that she has bookclub! No way are we able to have a date. We need to make sure she's comfortable and able to drink it in. It's a rare treat for her.
*** Kinda worried that people aren't going to show up (despite how well it went last time, world only seems to move faster and faster).

** The range of people I want to VC with dwindles each passing year. I am not much for groupchats, group pvp, groupwork, and so forth. My immediate family is an exception.
