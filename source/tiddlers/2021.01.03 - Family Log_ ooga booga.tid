!! Write a paragraph summarizing each person's week:

** 1uxb0x
*** I had a good week for the most part, but it had some worse parts. I had some great presents, I got a game I've wanted for years (Rimworld.) But I also got a knife that was pretty useless (It didn't function.) One of my favorite gifts was the compass I got, it's very interesting.
** j3d1h
*** I'm glad you had a good week, despite the breakdown. It's good you're happy about getting Rimworld! I thought you might be upset about it being too expensive, actually. I'm sorry about the knife, that does suck. Playing MTG against //specifically you// has been very fun, thanks!
** k0sh3k
*** I'm glad you had a good week. I've enjoyed moving the Wise Men around this week, and you've been good at finding them; I hope you've enjoyed it, too. I'm also glad we got to watch Chicago; I hope you liked it as much as I did. I hope you liked your new sheet set - It should be comfy and warm. I know you got to play some games (hopefully you got to play some of your new game and it was awesome for you), and I can tell you're thinking hard about your Magic deck. One more week before school starts back up - I hope you enjoy it while getting everything set up nicely!

*** [[1uxb0x]] had some serious negative feelings this week, but he also had a some great days. He had back to back parties without any responsibilities, watched //Chicago//, played [[vidya]] [[games]], tinkered with MUC (he's getting better at bluffing too), and even got some work done on his room and the basement. He received some pretty dope presents for a person his age. Feels like he keeps getting taller too (or I'm still not used to the growth spurt he had yet). He's got a lot to do in the coming week, getting back up on the horse. Let's hope he will prepare himself for the coming semester and more.

* [[j3d1h]]
** 1uxb0x
*** Thank you for hosting the tv stuff, it was kind of you. Again, thank you for the present, I loved it. You never seem to be in a good mood, and when you are, it goes away quickly. I'm sorry my present is taking so long.
** j3d1h
*** Gifts and sugar were fantastic this week. Drawing has been a struggle, but I might get into writing. I already have a few ideas to expand on. Talking to friends was.. interesting, to say the least. Zee seems increasingly gross, and I'm worried about how Butter will react to that.
** k0sh3k
*** You had far too much sugar this week; I hope you enjoyed it! Devotions have been very nice; I'm glad you like the poetry we're reading, and thinking about the structure of it. I hope you like your new sheet set, too. You've been doing artwork; I hope we get to see some of the finished works soon. Chicago was good; thank you for setting it up in your room. I hope you spend this next week getting everything set up nicely, so that you'll be ready to go when school starts back up! I can tell you are becoming an emotional support system for your circle of friends; I hope you'll be careful to not let them leech too much energy from you, though. (That's a bad habit of mine; don't be like me.)
** h0p3
*** [[j3d1h]] had a significant break, and it seemed to be good for her. She's been socializing quite a bit. She's been using her parents' bank accounts (with permission), and hopefully she will continue to explore and think about these devices wisely. She made amazing roasted potatoes (may it be one of many simple recipes in her back pocket). Her room has been as clean as we can remember, and she hosted another small get together for the family (she let me lay down on her mat as a foot rest for my wife [which turned out to be exactly what I wanted]). We've had some rough days this week with similar failures. Let us hope her machines are up and running this week.

* [[k0sh3k]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I've liked how you've been hiding the wise men. I thought you already did the "Whats a secret that..." prompt? I'm sorry for having to ask so many times as to what present I got someone, I'm very forgetful. Thank you for getting us cake.
** j3d1h
*** I'm happy that you read and relaxed a lot for your vacation. That's an interesting way to learn that lesson, but I hope you never eat said plant again. Also, I wouldn't be surprised if a migraine told you 2020 would be awful. That sounds exactly like you.
** k0sh3k
*** I watched a lot of shows and read a lot of books. I also played more Magic w/ h0p3 than I ever intended to. My new French press has been the best thing ever; it makes exactly one day's worth of coffee. My new mug from my BC haul is awesome, too. I found a cheap hair gel that seems to be working just as well as the expensive stuff, so far! ^^Yay^^ I got the kids sheets and bathrobes; I think they like them. I also watched Chicago with them and have had fun hiding the Wise Men all over the house over Christmas season. We all ate far too much sugar this week. I'm glad we're getting evaluated for solar; I hope it works out. I'm still Covid-negative, hurrah! I have enjoyed vacation; I just hope going back to work next week isn't too bad. 
** h0p3
*** [[k0sh3k]] spent her time reading until she was bothered enough by her husband to spend time with him. She's been mapping the house onto the rest of the world, including the possibility of solar. It's not been an absolute vacation for her, but it was pretty chill (I hope next year will be much smoother). She's got her corner in the living room she's spent most of her waking hours escaping into, and I can imagine her being there for many decades to come. She also has a really dirty butthole because she does not use the bidet (literally spicy). She's jumping into work again; may she prevent her exploitation while serving others well.

** 1uxb0x
*** Incest is rarely funny, dad. I've noticed the lacking of interactions with you. You're clearly a good person, not that many would go into debt for, and help their brother again and again. I've enjoied playing magic with you.
** j3d1h
*** I wish you and Samwise would just leave the rest of us be. As usual, some of your memes are really good, and the rest are horrific. Thanks for gathering links, at least. I hate that one of the selling points was virtue signalling, but then again, it always is.
** k0sh3k
*** I had a lot of fun with you this week, although I'm sure you thought I wasn't spending nearly enough time with you. (Chairman Meow sympathizes.) You seem to be curling up even more, and I hope you are doing so wisely - you don't do well completely cut off. Or maybe it's time to try another game? I like your 2020 goals; maybe we should always do our yearly goals at the end of the year, lol. Thank you for working so much on my room and thinking about how I could best use the space. 
** h0p3
*** [[h0p3]] made sure his wife took it easy, made sure folks partied, worked on the house, and tried to take over the world. ⁸Δ⁸ ; it was dope. He's been curling up, isolating, ruminating far more than usual, walking with his wife, and spending significant chunks of time pacing as he speaks to himself (sorry Alan Watts). Watching the world and thinkin about his place in it, he's feeling a bit low, and he's gonna lay low for a while. He needs to make sure his offspring are prepared, continue working on the house, and it would be nice to start work on the attic.
