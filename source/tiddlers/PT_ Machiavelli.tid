; 1469-1572: Machiavelli

* People in general are ungrateful, fickle, hypocritical, cowardly, and greedy.
* A ruler will perish if he is always good; he must be cunning as a fox and fierce as a lion.
* A ruler should appear to be merciful, faithful, humane, upright, and most importantly, religious.
* A ruler should not mind being considered cruel, as long as his actions restore order, peace, and loyalty in the end.
* Men are so simple and so much dominated by their immediate needs, that a deceitful man will always find plenty who are ready to be deceived.
