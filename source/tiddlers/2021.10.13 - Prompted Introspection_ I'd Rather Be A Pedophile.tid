title: 2021.10.13 - Prompted Introspection: I'd Rather Be A Pedophile

!! Would you rather have accidentally killed someone, or be a non-offending pedophile?

It depends on the someone, but I suppose it stops being completely accidental when I get to choose based on who was otherwise accidentally killed. I must preserve the innocent. Without question, I'd rather be a non-offending pedophile. I know that seems like a repugnant thing to signal. In many circles I've been in, you not only lose face, but you take on risk of personal injury to not immediately, kneejerk deny even the possibility that, all else being equal, non-offending pedophiles are better (or have better outcomes) in any way than those who accidentally kill people, let alone that said pedophiles could actually live lives of merit or deserve to be treated as persons of dignity. This sort of question tends to reveal unreflective gut instincts in people. The initial rational answer is obvious enough, though I admit there's consequentialist reasoning that may push the other direction. Without more information, this is clearly the best answer I have.
