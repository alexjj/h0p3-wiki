"""
[12:28 AM] Shp: hi! we're hanging out in the lounge, come join us if you can! :)

[11:09 AM] Shp: how are you doing?
[12:01 PM] h0p3: I'm doing alright.
[12:01 PM] h0p3: Finding a place to live.
[12:01 PM] h0p3: Lots to think about.
[12:01 PM] h0p3: Mostly curled up though.
[12:02 PM] h0p3: How about you?
[12:04 PM] Shp: sounds overwhelming, I sympathize
[12:06 PM] Shp: was wondering how to invite you to VC with us cause we're hanging out sometimes in the lounge and I'm always saying how cool would it be if you'd join as well
[12:07 PM] h0p3: I appreciate that. Pretty reclusive, lol.
[12:09 PM] h0p3: I generally just sit back in group settings unless it is a classroom.
[12:12 PM] Shp: no pressure, just letting you know we'd enjoy your company! :) (I'm comfortable saying we, because when I bring it up iirc the response is usually "me too but he's probably busy rn")
[12:31 PM] Shp:
Finding a place to live.
tell me more about this
or link me related tiddlers, that works too :)
[12:34 PM] h0p3: Strewn about [[CTS]] and [[Review]]s in small threads of reasoning and description. Nothing well-planned or grand anything to pick out in the wiki here (though, one of my {[[Dreams]]} from the beginning of writing it appears to be materializing to some degree).
[12:35 PM] h0p3: [[REDACTED]]
[12:38 PM] h0p3: In case it should matter for you. If you ever make your way near the states, you have a place with us (even unplanned or spontaneously).
[12:39 PM] Shp: that is very kind of you to say I'm welcome (hopefully I'm not misunderstanding)
[12:41 PM] Shp: feels like I didn't deserve it though
[12:42 PM] h0p3: I offer my home to people I've known for only an hour sometimes. I've known you for many more hours than most.
[12:42 PM] h0p3: Plus, I [[like]] you. It's easy. I'd be thrilled to have the chance.
[12:44 PM] Shp: all those feelings are mutual :)
[12:45 PM] Shp: in fact, if you're ever in Europe, I offer the same! :)
[12:45 PM] h0p3: We were inspecting a home today. It appears to be in reasonable order, but I know little. It's a WWII house that's been flipped. Old mechanics, but they work. Little to fix, but lots of room to grow. Looking through the old things hidden in the walls, a small book of pictures of a family who lived in it before, a Life magazine about moon landing, thinking about the construction I may be engaging in.
[12:45 PM] h0p3: Gracias. I will take you up on that offer.
[12:45 PM] h0p3: Assuming I'm fortunate enough to travel.
[12:46 PM] Shp: do you have plans to visit Europe? have you ever been here? (sorry if I should know that already or we've talked about it)
[12:47 PM] h0p3: I do not anticipate that I will. It is not my prediction.
[12:47 PM] h0p3: Never been either.
[12:47 PM] h0p3: Would be dope though.
[12:50 PM] Shp: what does the line "It's a WWII house that's been flipped" mean? 
(I imagined a house that is literally upside down :D)
[12:55 PM] h0p3: Rentseekers, capitalists, reactionaries, and the political [[power]] structures surrounding real estate have grown a special kind of behemoth in the US (and elsewhere). Buying houses for cash, applying lipstick and rouge to them, then selling them marked up ("flipping" them) significantly higher based on that appearance is its own bubble of an industry.
[12:55 PM] Shp: I see
[12:56 PM] h0p3: I walk through a process of people whose jobs are to lie to me, to extract value from me through dishonest means. It was an education in people and in what may be my home.
[12:57 PM] Shp: I feel like that describes most products and services these days
[12:58 PM] h0p3: That is fair to say.
[1:07 PM] Shp: in fact,  ... this is a tangent, sorry.. I don't like sports and avoid them so I'm not exposed to this world at all, so when my brother was here the other night and wanted to watch a game I was not going to join, but ended up sitting down with him and it was a new/unique experience for me - we talked, and the game started. and I realized, this whole thing, that they show sports on TV, and hold the events for people to visit, is to advertise and sell stuff. there is literally no value in the thing itself. none that I could see. and there's a tremendous amount of monetary value that's  attached to it purely because it sells stuff.
[1:08 PM] Shp: I mean it's kind of obvious, but since I never given it any thought besides "i don't care" it's all new to me
maybe there's like an entertainment value (not much if there is, its more just forced upon people imo because of peer pressure and advertisements), but why not play sports instead, at least that's more fun and has health benefits
[1:09 PM] h0p3: I've watched a lot of MMA and esports. I can appreciate disregarding sportsball too. It pacifies the masses. It is a means for the people to take up ingroups/outgroups that are meaningless. It creates passive observers who are deluded into thinking they are participating in something more than a spectacle.
[1:10 PM] h0p3: It misdirects people from attending to what matters most.
[1:11 PM] h0p3: And, boy howdy, do I know how to waste my time, lol.
[1:13 PM] Shp:

exactly!
[1:28 PM] Shp:

I know the answer is in your wiki, and I think I asked this already, but: what matters most? 

that reminds me: I've been meaning to ask the following for a while, but I'm always afraid because I feel like your wiki answers this question but I'm not certain and even if it does, its not clear for me. (sorry) and if I'm supposed to find it there or piece it together instead of asking then I'm a douche because I don't look.

what makes something salient? is there such a thing as something being objectively salient?

cause I feel like having clear priorities define what's salient, but priorities change and are different for everyone, they're not objective.

and, to end with something more specific: I feel like art is not worth the time many people invest in it, I feel like there are more important things to do and care about than art (I spend most days not caring about anything but art) so I'm in great conflict
[1:30 PM] Shp: (but I think there must be such a thing as objectively salient)
[1:40 PM] h0p3: I know where you are pointing. Let us imagine I am imagining the concept of subjectivity told from my own as best as I knew how. I have heard some people say my wiki is an example of personality among personal knowledge base examples in the wild. I aim to explore that very thoroughly and as fairly as I can possibly muster. Before I would attempt to answer further, you must tell me your understanding of the concept of egoism. I ask you think carefully for an answer for me. It will be important for you to know in my [[Wiki Litmus Test]] that I aim to realpolitik sublate postmodernism. It's quite a dialectical tick-tock task. You would need to speak about [[The Dialetheia]] with me eventually.
[1:44 PM] h0p3: If there is a duel between Marx and Hegel, I'm studying it as best I know how (which is quite poor, I know).
[1:48 PM] h0p3: We are going to have to tell the story together. You also have very little skin in the game.
[1:53 PM] Shp:

just to be sure:  nothing here is misspelled or missing, in other words: is this what you meant to write?
[1:56 PM] h0p3: I am choosing those moves on the screen in front of us. Those are insufficient and hardly well said though.
[1:59 PM] Shp: my understanding of egoism is superficial
[1:59 PM] h0p3: I do not aim for gnosticism, nor the merely esoteric (but I obviously agree to a true contradiction somewhere), and I think subjectivity is incomplete. It cannot justify itself well enough.
[1:59 PM] h0p3: You do not need an answer now.
[2:03 PM] h0p3: I am not assigning homework. I'm not trying to generate a password with you (though I recognize a significant set of questions arise from the problems of [[other]] minds, skepticism ought to run deep even just to show us the fabric and shape and category of what it means to know anything at all about the thing-in-itself or things-in-themselves changing, where quantifying always fails to speak wisely enough [and this is also a place where empiricists fail somewhere fundamentally too], sadly [and, I'm a big fan of math, even if I'm awful at it]). I am trying to build a bridge as best I know how.
[2:05 PM] h0p3: Maybe it is a tower of babel. I am babbling, like a madman. I know. I'm sorry. This is the best I can do with what I have.
[2:06 PM] Shp: I love math and I'm awful at it too :)
[2:07 PM] Shp: sorry, I'm trying to understand the rest, gonna take a while
[2:12 PM] Shp: I'm afraid I won't understand at all
[2:15 PM] h0p3: Well, I can't say I understand much myself. I appreciate that it might not be what matters most, but I am doing what I can to think of it and live thinking with it as best I know how.
[2:17 PM] h0p3: I am making a ùï±ùï¥ùïΩùï∞ in the wilderness. I [[hope]] it's a campfire where conversation is a sacrament.
[2:19 PM] h0p3: I am a hyperreligious person. It's part of my Geschwind Syndrome.
[2:24 PM] Shp: it's going to take me quite some research to respond to these without sounding like a total idiot
[2:24 PM] Shp: so, I am engaging with what you've said, but not going to reply probably for a while
[2:24 PM] h0p3: Naw. I sound like an idiot all the time. You know that too.
[2:26 PM] h0p3: I appreciate that you would think of it at all. I know it's an expensive use of one's time.
[2:29 PM] Shp: quite some research is an overstatement, I just mean I'll have to search some terms before I can understand what you mean
