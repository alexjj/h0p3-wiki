title: 2020.11.19 - Prompted Introspection: What I Eat

!! It has been said, "You are what you eat." Rewrite that phrase: "You are what you ____."

Read and write. All-night-long-for-breakfast.

I am not a fan of this phrase as is for anything serious, but doing the work to add a "[Part of who]" prefix qualifier seems a reasonable first stab at fixing the problem. I enjoy that it's dumb usually. It's a way to talk idiomatic shit. I wish I could tell you what I really want to be in virtue of what I really want to eat. y u m.<<ref "y">> Material dialectics and primitive mimesis are embedded in this meme. It's not well-reasoned, but it's an analogy worth mulling around.

I see lots of attempts to describe an emergent metaphysics from physics (backwards AF, but I find it fascinating). Materialist conceptions of consciousness must be part of the story, no doubt. I feel that in this phrase too, especially with my answer here. 

As you know, Samwise, I am wrestling with the linguistic turn. Language is the only option I have for publically exploring the supraempirical enquiry into the essential features of reality. It is part of our telos to engage in this reading and writing method, and not merely to therapeutically quiet ourselves. We do not escape the problem of clarification.
