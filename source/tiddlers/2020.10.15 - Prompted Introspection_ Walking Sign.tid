title: 2020.10.15 - Prompted Introspection: Walking Sign

!! What traffic sign best reflects your life right now?

Probably a pedestrian caution sign of some kind. I've been walking a lot. I kinda feel like Forrest Gump, a wee bit. I'm not sprinting through life at the moment either, and I'm able to take things at a saner pace. I'm overstimulated and numbed to so much too. It's not apathy, but my amygdala isn't running the show nearly as much. I'm feeling more comfortable responding more slowly too, and I feel like I've earned the right to be more quiet. I have a hard time seeing myself taking a break, but I'm ready to not go so hard. Perhaps this is a rationalization. We're gonna see. I'd like to get back to [[The Remodeling]].
