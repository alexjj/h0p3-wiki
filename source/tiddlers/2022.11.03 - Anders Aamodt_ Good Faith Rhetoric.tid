title: 2022.11.03 - Anders Aamodt: Good Faith Rhetoric

https://www.reddit.com/r/sorceryofthespectacle/comments/yiq7ae/dead_and_entitled_people_have_written_a_lot_of/

§1 - A Sounding Board to OP in light of the rest of the thread.

My problem with rhetoric is that it often has so little to do with the truth or what really matters, directly or indirectly, and intentionally so.<<ref "y">> You appeared to claim to just be writing to say whatever you wanted to say, perhaps with ironic non-commitment, presumably with little regard for whether or not you should write it, let alone if it was accurate or justified in either its representation of the world or as a memetic instrument otherwise. Surely, you're after more than merely inspiring feelings in others in a way that gives you pleasure. 

Looking through the rest of the thread, where you are being meta about your piece, I think it's fair to say you don't seem to care enough for cogency outside of the piece either. So, I think it's fair to worry that your writing is dishonest, and then wonder if you're justified in dishonesty (if you were). If your goal isn't to make a cogent argument, but instead a realpolitik meme that winks or to masturbatorily pontificate, you've nailed it.<<ref "l">> To your question: I can appreciate the instrumental reasoning of spectacular sophistry, if that's what you're asking. If you're after something more reasonable, then, yes, there's significant improvements to make. But, you already knew that. `/nod`. 

You're a skilled postmodern critic and mind colonizer, and you are clever with words:<<ref "hc">> but I don't think you've been sufficiently constructive on this cluster of topics. It's going to require giving up your absolute hatred for robust moral realism (which, under entailment, includes quite a bit you hate), perhaps one of the few things I've seen you really hate. 

No, or at least almost no, fair judge of your words can deny that you get a lot right, in some crazy hard places too (and you betcha I still read and think about what you have to say). I [[hope]] we can build the bridge together, sir. I think it's fair to say we should have significant doubts that will occur. Sincerity is expensive.

> Anyone who says that laws written in the capitol apply to all the people in the countryside is a nazi, straight up.

Quite a posture.

That's hyperbole (and, in the spirit of such a thing: I know you are shocked to hear that and all). Perhaps you mean to say they are as evil as a nazi. But, after speaking to you about the nature of what you've written, I don't think you care if you're being careful here. The pursuit of truth is not obviously what your diatribe was about, not even indirectly or methodologically. Of course, neither of us know how to say what ought to be said (a complex problem, no doubt) as well as we'd [[like]].

It's pretty obvious that at least some laws apply to us whether we want it to be the case or not, some of them even written down somewhere in a capitol. I suppose you mean to pick out how social constructs are not necessarily picking out what is true, sufficiently valuable, or morally binding. That I can agree to (and in ways that may be difficult to swallow). However, there are possible representations of laws that do apply to us in these situations and ought.<<ref "rp">>

Even your own writing here strikes me as law-like, and I assume capitols are somewhat arbitrary.

> The state and statists are the problem and the state is a fantasy of a universal aetheric moral substance that enables universal "justified" computation. 

That's an odd conflation, and it seems to do too much rhetorical work for you.  

First off, states are real, material object-processes in this world that can't be further reduced to mental states.<<ref "th">> They are not mere fantasies. And, even if current states are based on fantasies doesn't mean they all must be. Presumably, you mean to distinguish fantasy, as a delusion, from imagination. Perhaps you mean to say the pursuit of a state is in virtue of such a fantasy, but that too must be questioned.

Second, legal positivists deny that's what conceptually consists in a state, law, or a statist; I think they've a fine starting point for us. The legal positivist will agree that a Nazi government is conceptually a valid government though, and you seem to be open to that, `/squint`. Issues of justification and morality are irrelevant on the legal positivist's claim (and, perhaps you might agree to that sometimes). And, like them, I deny that states and statists necessarily agree to or experience what you call a "fantasy." It seems readily apparent that at least some states and statists really haven't taken themselves to be pursuing such a thing either. Obviously, mere legal positivism is unsufficient in our normative analysis. 

So, what makes that government immoral? I submit that it's a fact external to our minds. That's not something you like to hear, I know. Your argument crumbles without appealing to it though. You know that though. `/shrug`.

> Any application of force at a distance is the action of a state.

Your spectacular piece here fits that criteria. Further, you moderate the SotS forum and force things upon people (however minor that may seem to you). It seems like you are an actor of a state of some kind. Perhaps you mean not merely any application of force, which is quite a broad claim (more inclusive than I think you intend). You are no nazi though, sir. I submit, you agree to governance in at least some contexts, even if you aren't aiming to be cogent or consistent about the matter. I'd like to see you reason about coercion in such cases. I think you're in a lot of trouble here. `/nod`. 

Given that you are explicitly employing rhetoric (at the expense of reason too), I'm wondering if you knew this all along (hard to tell if you thought about what your words meant not just to you in that moment). There's something to be said for at least quasi-hypocritically crossing the line you are decrying. It's quite an act, and maybe it is necessary to achieve your goals, maybe even justified. Your follow-up claims suggest you aren't really interested in justification though (and, the argument itself doesn't seem to point that direction either).

> A bunch of epistemically-entitled appropriators of the universal Reason might delude themselves into thinking they can write universal law, and they might write some very nice things, but the sick bolus at the center of these documents will always be when they attempt to arrange the lives of distant people according to a preconceived image. 

XD. Your own rhetoric strikes me as quite entitled, no doubt. Do you mean to say there is such a thing as universal Reason? It seems to me that elsewhere you have denied it. Note, of course, that just because some people attempted to misappropriate such a thing doesn't mean that it cannot be wisely represented, understood, and wielded. To make sure we aren't strawmanning here, I want to be clear that plenty of those who took themselves to be writing about the contents of universal law saw themselves as representing something outside themselves (the act of writing or socially constructing the representation is not what they would take to be the creation of universal law, but rather an attempt to discover it). I would deny that anyone writes the universal law in its entirety itself, though I will agree that the possibility of their qualia (and its contents) is necessary for the computation of such a thing. 

Do you think you've escaped attempting to arrange the lives of distant people according to a preconceived image here? I don't, and I remain unconvinced that you do. Note, of course, that preconception is almost vacuously the case here. I think you're engaging in the very process you say others shouldn't. Without moral realism, your argument disintegrates (and, it seems to disintegrate //with// moral realism too). Let me be clear, one way of talking about the spirit of [[The Moral Law]] just is to say we ought not try to make an exception of ourselves (even if, in practice, our circumstances are unique and require some other, unobvious universal).

> The construction of law based upon universal Reason is fucked because it has no theoretical concept of time or the gradual rollout of this official version of Reason to those who have never heard of it yet. 

I suppose you mean to say human constructed law here, as perhaps we might want to leave open some other possibilities here. I'll agree that "the construction" itself has no concept, in the sense that it probably lacks a mind (I'm disambiguating here). You've a hilarious strawman there of those pursuing Reason™ as reasonably as possible. The [[infinigress]] is a bullet to bite, I'll agree, but to think there's not even a conceivable contextualized, particularized right way to understand what is right isn't right if you keep walking down the path. You're not even trying to be reasonable about it here.

> So it begins and at once occludes its evangelical project under the loud trumpet of universal rights and universal suffrage, universal access to the goods of society. 

`/slowclap`. ~~Preach, yo!~~ What's the right way to evangelize? It's so odd to see someone say it's morally wrong to say anything is morally wrong. Note, of course, that people can employ //mere rhetoric// for great evils, but this is why I don't think we should put much trust in those who wield rhetoric so brazenly (and at the expense of honest investigations). 

> But these "universal" rights are only granted to those who choose to show up as a Citizen in the statist—culturally, economically, and epistemically colonized—society.

Many people have lied about X, and that's why X isn't true, possible, worth pursuing, or necessary for my argument. XD. You continue to strawman. 


> Deinstitutionalization means the eventual or ultimate deletion of the Citizen role. But we need not throw out the baby with the bathwater. We can keep all the good things about being a citizen, but just throw out the hegemonic authority with which citizenship is recognized. This means 1) Everybody becomes authorized to judge "citizenship" for themselves, whatever that means, and 2) The provision of rights and goods becomes based on human, not mechanical, judgment. The implications of #1 is that there is no longer a central authority dispensing centralized binary citizenship (is/is not a citizen universally)—and, there may be the emergence of many "citizenships" that all become important, rather than one centralized statist Citizenship dominating everything and everyone's concept of identity.

> One side-effect of this is that we will gain the right to choose who protects us. Claiming to be the police for another person is a claim of ownership over them. Showing up to a situation to police it is a claim of general ownership over or prerogative from the people there.

> The fact is, somebody claiming that they have prerogative to police you or to write law for you, just because they claim that they already speak for a large number of people (many of whom would vehemently disagree that they are spoken for), is total bullshit and we all know it. Not only is this logic of "I was elected and therefore I write the laws for the people who didn't elect me" circular and morally and logically bankrupt from the start, this rhetoric serves no function at all except to invalidate resistance and dissent against unwanted statist governance.

> Statism is essentially ruling people who did not agree to it: in other words, ruling persons against their will, or applying force from a safe distance.

> We can easily invert our horrible system to imagine a better one (instead of wasting our time blustering against these obvious truths about the obvious moral bankruptcy of statism and all institutions). What if instead of being forced to assent to horrible leaders, we proactively told each other who are favorite living leaders are? And then we proactively shared their writings or speeches, and talked about the political issues they are raising? I think very quickly, by finding our favorite leaders and then asking them who their favorite leaders are, we would find the true leaders of the free world. These are the people we should be paying attention to, ideologically following, and listening to as we write our laws. These are the true, the wise secret chiefs who are currently the true and deposed rulers of planet Earth, the ones who would take better care of the planet and its people.

> The fascist despots installed by blanketing the countryside in lies are not real leaders, they are installed simulacra of leadership meant to influence people into forgetting to proactively talk about their true leaders and their true values. Even a tiny bit of real, positive-spiral politics is extremely dangerous to negative-feedback-loop-based systems such as institutions.

> There is a new kind of law yet to be written, non-universal law. This would be law for persons who assented to it, and who helped write and rewrite it. Non-universal law is law not based on an asinine contradiction: the literally idiotic assumption that universal law can be written by a finite, instantiated, flawed person from a particular cultural and historical and education background and still apply to everyone somehow. Gleefully rubbing their dicks on the page, white men have been speaking for absent subaltern people since the declaration of the Universal was first spoken and used as the rhetorical basis for law.

> It's a shitty, manipulative rhetoric and we all hate it! 

Yikes. I'm looking at your [[beautiful]] [[art]] thinking it's also shitty, manipulative rhetoric. Note, of course, that just becase we all hate it doesn't mean it's wrong (which was part of your point elsewhere). 

> The social contract is dead. I declare it dead, I recognize that it has already died, I recognize that we have all already collectively recognized the death of the social contract.

> Fuck nations. 

Charitably, I interpret you to be saying that we should focus on the Kingdom of Ends, a universal class, a recognition of the dignity of persons, seeking [[justice]] in which our morally arbitrary characteristics are handled as such. 

I despise nationalism, but that is on the grounds that it's a failure to construct a international government. 

> Fuck any authority who claims to speak for someone who isn't their follower, who hasn't explicitly said that their idol can speak for them. 

I agree to proxy voting. If you are concerned with fair representation, you know, justified governance, then we'd have plenty to speak about. Note, of course, that we are forced to speak on behalf of future generations in the principal-agent problem, and similarly for those who deserve a vote but aren't capable of providing informed consent. 

> Fuck anyone who holds up a piece of paper or some words on a computer and tells you that's why you have to do what they say. 

Lol. `/squint`. Dope screed, sir. 

> Fuck anyone who goes along complicitly or eagerly with abusive systems and gaslighting propaganda campaigns—we all know from watching Fascbook's rise and fall how important willing participation is in propping up these systems! So stop it

> ! Stop collaborating with systems and with people who try to make decisions for other persons! Plan, at the earliest opportunity, ways to exit every system to which you have been yoked and forced to pull the plow. This is not hatred—this is love of what we could have if we spent our time and resources on the truly good things, instead!


If must feel so liberating to say things like this.


Immoral anarchism. `/shrug`. Picking out both our categorial dignity alongside the humility we should know and live is no easy task, I realize. You're too well-read and practiced in this sphere not to make better moves than you do though.





Being opposed to immoral coercion isn't equivalent to being opposed to governance. There are cases of justified coercion, and you know that. You also don't seem to attempt to provide any theory of it. 



§2 - Thinking about your other words in that thread.


Given your other comments, I think you've been disingenous. So, perhaps what follows is someone taking your own words (throughout the thread) more seriously than you did. If you do respond, I hope you will rise up to the challenge and speak carefully, honestly, cogently, and with as little rhetoric as necessary to communicate with me. 

<<<
> A monopoly on legal force gives majorities the power to regulate and protect themselves from bad actors. It also rationalizes power to the extent that it's actually used in accordance with laws. That provides predictability and security from the temporary whims of majorities and bad actors.

This is the best defense anyone could make for the state and I really appreciate you writing it for me/us. However, I do not see any way to prevent the majority from being a bad actor itself, so I would rather just not. There is no concentration of power apart from statism, and there is no statism without the exercise of power on unconsenting people from a safe distance.
<<<

You can't achieve certainty here. You might not even achieve any odds of success you'd find satisfactory. That doesn't mean you shouldn't, even if you'd rather not. Further, that doesn't mean that some fundamental problems don't boil down to requiring democratic solutions. 

<<<
> Have you ever actually read any of the social contract theorists?

I have.

I don't respect the majority, I think the majority and its dynamics are the bad actor, and I think it's a very limited imagination that stops trying to imagine better forms of government there.

> States don't stop you from doing this.

My argument is that they very actively do, they actively prevent many people from engaging in real politics. Governments very actively blanket the country with propaganda that promotes voting on an extreme pedestal. This propaganda, including all the mainstream bullshit political debates, take up valuable public space and time that would otherwise be spent discussing things that weren't total bullshit.

The existing government very actively tries to perpetuate itself and brainwash everyone into thinking that the state is the only way to do things. Anyone who can't see that is really blind, not paying any attention at all—and anyone who really believes statism is the only way we can do things is not trying very hard to use their imagination to imagine other ways the world could be.

> Bizarre fetishization of "the countryside."

No I just mean anyone who isn't involved in crafting said propaganda. Propaganda is something made by one party to influence an external party. The capitol is where these fake universalist stories of absolute legal fiction are crafted, the countryside is where they are trumpeted and forced down everyone's throats for sanctioned regurgitation.

> The problem isn't the use of reason or the universal. It's assholes who impose narrow and harmful minority worldviews (i.e., rich white property owners) in place of the views of majorities, or true universals.

It's just a synechdoche. The problem IS the insistence that universality is universal, i.e., that laws apply and can ethically speak of those who did not assent to them.

> Right, we've all recognized it, that's why you needed to let us know with your little screed. 

Nietzsche declared the death of God. Someone's got to say it. I'm sure many people have said it, are saying it.

I think you're missing the larger rhetorical move I was making. "We all recognize it" is a rhetorical move that assumes the position of the universal authority! But, the whole point of my essay is to say that making universal claims about absent people is bad, so why would I do this exact thing myself in the very same essay!? Well, it's to demonstrate both the pigheaded rhetorical force and the logical fallibility of such universal assertions. Maybe not everyone agrees that the social contract is dead, maybe not everyone recognizes that. But by declaring it as universally true, I form a new polis, a new people: A people that recognizes the death of the social contract. You can deny my reality and my universal that I declared all you want, but that won't make it untrue, it won't quit being true for me and everyone else who agreed with that statement when they read it. That statement itself fractures the worlds and enacts the [shattering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtzlj6opANA) of the social contract. It is the de-cision of the two worlds: An old world where people didn't yet recognize the death of the social contract, even though it was already dead and ever-shambling loathfully into our homes—and a new world where a new people DOES recognize the death of the social contract as well as the plurality of universalism and the death of concentric universality.

> This ain't one of them. It shows next to no engagement with or understanding of the actual claims of social contract theorists. This kind of manifesto leans on conspiratorial and wishful thinking.

Yeah, it's a polemic piece. And the whole point of it is this: YOU have to justify YOUR social contract to ME. It's the STATE's responsibility to justify itself to the people non-violently. It is NOT the people's responsibility to bend over backwards justifying a despotic state. If there were a responsible state—and I do believe such a thing is perhaps theoretically possible—it would do active outreach to every single citizen to cultivate conversations around the social contract and collect genuine thoughts and inputs from everyone in society, to *proactively* improve governance conditions, if not also living conditions, for everyone.

> Oh, there are actually people who devote their lives to trying to improve the state and write the fairest version of the social contract?

If they say their ideas are universal and apply to everyone, then they are part of the problem. If they drop this part of their claims, they can almost immediately become part of the solution. Universalism is so fundamental to statism and so toxic that it's simply not an acceptable public (political) point of view anymore. Of course I can understand universalism and I can think that way. But it's not a permissible perspective to promote or propagate in public, because historically AND contemporaneously, this rhetoric of universal law is STILL used to casually erase subaltern people and minorities in every vote in every democracy=voting country.

And yes analytic or political philosophers who claim to speak for everyone are philosophers, not leaders. I can really appreciate universalism in analytic philosophy, but it has *absolutely* no place in politics, where it is a category error to bring a universalist perspective to the bargaining table. Universality is something found in the Ideal realm, not in the realm of meat and and corpuscles.

> This is the worst kind of pseudo-leftist politics that places a premium on radical aesthetics while denigrating the mere thought of a democratic, law-governed society (something that, and this will shock you, most people are really in favor of).

You've completely missed the point. The rhetoric of a law-abiding society is what was used, for example, to give us the war on drugs! "Law and order" is a cliche associated with the Republican party and violent police crackdowns on minority populations. It's not that I'm not a fan of universal law, no! I like philosophy! I like intelligible Forms! No, it's not that—It's the fact that the rhetoric of law and social contracts is so toxic, so outdated, and causing so much ongoing damage that I vehemently feel we should abandon it entirely.

Your attempt to misframe nonconsensual despotism as the one and only game in town is broken. It's such an outdated worldview I don't have to provide any arguments. You argued it yourself—you said the state isn't stopping us from choosing alternative leaders.

So that's what I'm encouraging by my polemic attack upon statism, universally-applicable law, and the social contract. I want to encourage people to think differently, and the first step in that is rejecting the parochial view, or at least developing some critical distance to it.

I am a writer so I try to write things in the most intense (well-formed) possible way, and in a way that will be most convincing to my target audience. Dedicated universalists like you appear to be are not the target audience. Everyone else is.

For people who already felt a part of the new post-social-contract universe, but who perhaps didn't consciously recognize it yet, I hope the essay was galvanizing and helped to articulate some of the rage that we all feel at being expected to uncritically and dogmatically buy into a superficial and despotic concept of the social contract.

I would be interested in forming a real social contract with people that was consensual and not forced upon the next generation en masse.

I would love an actual democratic law-governed society! But we are NOT gonna get there by trying to theorize or talk about universally-applicable law, or standardized citizens of a monolithic central state.

Emergent explicit consensual social contracting is the future! Peer-to-peer eternal constitutional convention! Non-coercive direct democracy! Yes, we are building in the ruins of the old system, in the real world, so no, we don't have to create a fully-formed theoretically perfect system to replace what we have. We just have to stop letting people use words on paper as justification to apply nonconsensual force against people from a distance! For example I really applaud the Texans who recently defended a homeless camp from the police. They used human judgment to defend real people from real violence being perpetrated by statists and justified purely based on little bits of paper and claims to law and order.

> Don't know why anybody would come to this sub looking for 'principled' anything

>> This kind of manifesto leans on conspiratorial and wishful thinking.

> There's books on actual sorcery and magic in the sidebar????? My dude, where do you think you are?

I can see how it might look that way, if someone wasn't interested in in radical social change or was otherwise OK with the state in general.

However it is theoretically rigorous, the new perspective I've declared O_o

There is the world that is founded on the axiom, "We can define the concept of a 'social contract' to be accurate in all places and times." And there is the new world, founded on the axiom, "We reject the conflation of universal logic with universal law, and demand embodied and temporal law that respects every living body/person." Or simply "We cannot (ethically) write law for others, only ourselves."

> I've had this thought. Then it becomes about fracturing the old labels which is hard again.

Thanks! I like how that way of defining it contrasts with the definition of "work" as "force over distance". So it's as if the state produces work at a single point without having to go the intervening distance—as if by magic! all the roads and bodies and police and delivery trucks disappear, are erased under the lacuna of the statist fantasy of being able to manifest power instantaneously at any location on the globe. This is exactly why it is an ideal realm fantasy—in fact, there is always intervening distance that must be crossed and/or physical contact that must be made that is the mechanism of transition or locomotion in temporal/extensive reality. The discourse of the state simply conflates the two, substituting the mathematical simplification of quantified (and instantaneous) power for a proper imaginary  simulation of existence and its qualitative playings-out.

> Then it becomes about fracturing the old labels which is hard again.

Yeah, it's definitely the beginning of a conversation. The progressive inventing of new solidarities and the archeological re-excavation of old.

I'll also submit that it is difficult to know even our own intentions all the way down. In that case, given more context, I'm not convinced what I think is sufficiently relevant to say here. /nod.

I'm left wondering if you are practicing "rhetorical despotism" and asking us to practice "trap [you] in performative contradictions" here. Should I take your prescription to "[[sit back and relax, because [my] opponent already doesn't give a shit whether their arguments make any sense|https://www.reddit.com/r/sorceryofthespectacle/comments/y10boh/all_textual_authority_is_rhetorically_constituted/]]." It does seem like you are "essentially trying to offload [your] cognitive dissonance onto [us]."

You're so intelligent and knowledgable. Why do this?

If you answer, I [[hope]] it will be carefully.
