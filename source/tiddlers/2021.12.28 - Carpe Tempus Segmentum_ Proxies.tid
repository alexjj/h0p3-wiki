title: 2021.12.28 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Proxies

Put folks to bed, assignments for tomorrow. [[TTTOTW]]. Responding to [[MuWire]] folks.

//The Walk// with [[ASK]], second route then the U. Fuzz out. Vapelyfe. Icy and thick loafers (composite toe boot loafer hybrid*, fiteeen smackers). I needed that walk.

Noodles + Dark Chocolate + SC2. [[TTTOTW]]. Tears watching humans. No idea what time I fell asleep, but it was light out.

Woke at 2? Meditation. Fireman Time! Hugs'n'bugs for everyone. Mi amor is not feeling well: her belly (she thinks it's a tide coming, and, if so, this is the second time I have failed to predict it; I think we're all feeling different even). 

Hit the library with mi amor. She knows how to pick books. Other librarians there were after the ones she reserved, again. I do not have good taste. I prefer boobs.

[[TTTOTW]].

[[ASK]] continues to work on loonix, i3 in particular. She picks it up fast. She slows down at good points too. The job can be done faster, but I like many of the places she [[pause]]s (makes sense to me). 

The Offspring came down to grind in [[The Den]]. I cleaned, and my space is coming along nicely. Since I'm encountering more blocks and captchas (don't believe [[DarkMX]] or Retroshare run relays), I now actually do need a shadowsocks proxy (don't know how many times I've been here, `/smh`). Offspring and I found a cheap VPS for a bit over a buck a month (pleased to have a new kernel, as usually you're fucked at the lowend).

It's got all the basics, with dedicated ivp4 and a reasonable bandwidth cap. Could go for a custom iso, but I think it's good for them to practice with the other distributions again. [[j3d1h]] found the tool we'll be using to print up proxies for [[The Cube]]. She set up [[Resilio Sync]] and [[vpncloud.rs]], and he's setting up the proxy and webserver(s). 

[[Family Gathering]] with leftovers (dope) and [[MTG]]. Offspring played the usual match, and [[ASK]] and I played with all our cards open on the table to explore. +1 MWC vs Gobos with [[ASK]]. She demolished me. Very little serious background in the game, but has a solid grasp of the deck. Took me down to 9 cards (clawed my way into the game again and again, but she kept me at bay the entire time with a healthy margin for error and accident). A couple more tries, and I don't think she'll need any help at all (that's impressive).<<ref "i">> She wanted a troll deck, and this is a solid one. She doesn't like how slow she feels with it (and, it is epicly slow as it is), and maybe wants something more aggressive. Will work toward it.

[[TTTOTW]].

//The Walk// with [[ASK]]. One good question sends us on a deep rabbithole. Vapelyfe. Time flew.

Put offspring to bed. Accidentally woke mi amor. Not sure how to handle this one. Oh, she left me her ginger beer. Gracias.

[[TTTOTW]].
