title: 2020.05.01 - Computer Musings: Space

* I ran out of space of my hard drive. 
** It eventually happens on every incarnation of my [[monster]]. 
*** 3TB freed up. 
** Also, we've been having lagspikes over sshfs that don't normally occur, specifically to this drive. Seems a likely culprit. That's my current guess.
* Picked through the remnants of [[m10]]'s backups. Trashed the rest.
* Maybe I should head back to [[home-h0p3-snapshot.sh]]? 
** The rsync ghetto mirrors take forever, but not this (just costs compute). 

---

* P2P software on the windows VM is fucking chewing through CPU constantly. 
** I'm using these tools in a way they aren't designed for. 
** May have to trim it down considerably, or just not. 

---

* Finally, [[j3d1h]] verified that it's her hardware. YUSS!!! Finally.
** Also, that sucks, but we can solve that now.
** Aiming for identical hardware since we can cannibalize and re-use the chargers + new battery. 
*** Can't complain too much. $200 for a 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, Discrete graphics, and Ivy i7 is hard to beat. 
**** Yeah, it's ugly and heavy, but I don't give a shit. It has it where it counts. 

---

* Leaving swap back on.
* Autostarts adjusted
** Speaking of which, assignation is simply not working correctly
* System upgrade
* Cooling replaced
** 3 fans out.
** ASRock mobo fan autotuned again. Very quiet. Too quiet.

```bash
yay -S stress-ng --noconfirm
sudo pacman -S hardinfo --noconfirm 

watch -n 2 sensors #does the trick just fine
sudo watch -n 1  cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/cpuinfo_cur_freq
stress-ng --cpu 12 #not mean at all, nothing like IBT
```

* Temps come right up to the edge on max load
** No downclocking either. Cool.
* Much quieter. AMD stock is always louder than fuck. 
** We will rejoice.
