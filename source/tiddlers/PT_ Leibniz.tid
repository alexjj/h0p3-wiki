; 1646-1716: Leibniz

* There are two kinds of truths: (analytic) truths of reasoning and (synthetic) truths of fact
* The sufficient reason for a truth of reasoning is to be found by reasoning, without reference to external reality.
* The sufficient reason for a truth of fact is to be found by looking at external facts.
* There is a huge number of possible worlds.
* God, as a perfect being, created the best possible world.
* A world with free will is better than one without it; that's why God created this world with evil.
* If you could step inside a conscious machine, you would find only mechanical parts, and never anything by which to explain consciousness.
* Everything, matter or mind, is made up of indivisible, partless, non-interacting, immaterial, mind-like centers of activity, 'monads'.
* Bare monads (all monads in plants and inanimate objects; and subordinate monads in animal/human bodies) have unconscious perceptions.
* The central monads ('souls') of animals possess sensation or consciousness
* Some monads (God and the central monads of humans and angels; "minds") are capable of self-consciousness and rational perceptions.
* Every non-initial, non-miraculous, state of a monad has as a real cause some previous state of that very monad, but not of other monads
* Since monads cannot interact with each other, human minds and their bodies do not casually interact
* God does not act in the course of nature; it is against the laws of physics and it robs created things of all power and action.
* God programmed all monads at creation to stay in a pre-established harmony with each other; minds and bodies correspond with interaction.
* If two objects have exactly the same properties, then they are the same thing; indiscernible are identical.
* Nature makes no leaps; nothing takes place suddenly. (The Law of Continuity)
