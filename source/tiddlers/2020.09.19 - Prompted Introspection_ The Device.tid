title: 2020.09.19 - Prompted Introspection: The Device

!! What modern technological device takes up most of your time?

Picking out what consists in a device is not so simple. I could speak of the non-agential set of the world as such, in which case there isn't a moment that goes by that I'm not immersed in it. It feels like there is no escape (and I would like to test Heidegger's metal here). 

[[monster-16]] is the answer to the standard interpretation of the question. "Takes up" isn't the phrase I would use. Yeah, I do waste time on my machine (even as it is separate from the seeming waste of eudaimonic exploration and the instrumental necessity of doing nothing). I'm a computer addict, a cyborg wannabe. I think of [[m16]] as an extension of my identity even. My device is a part of me. I'm using myself and my time there to do these things for these reasons.
