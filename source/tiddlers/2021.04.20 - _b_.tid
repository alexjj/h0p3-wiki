In anti-skin-in-the-game contexts where people are not held accountable for openly admitting they were wrong (and accepting losses in their own status), in which social proofs of credibility built through allowing others to be wrong about what one is right about as a demonstration are ignored (or in cases where such demonstrations can never be morally justified), being right without credibility can still be sufficient for meeting one's obligations.

What isn't actually a hyperobject to the OOO-stoics who lay their privileged flowers at the gravestone of representing The Real? As they tend to do, insofar as naturalism and relativism draw attention to things at scale without selecting what is salient, they cannot have even the beginnings of a coherent ethic. They cannot speak in defense of those who have not yet been conceived as fully a person either. It is all flattened into mere unity. So, Cratylus, be silent.
