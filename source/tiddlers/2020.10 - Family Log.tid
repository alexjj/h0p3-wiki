* [[2020.10.11 - Family Log: your brain... run by GOBLIN]]
* [[2020.10.18 - Family Log: Hi, you must be reading this, but little do you realise I'm trying to fill this with text. Now you know exactly what I'm trying to do, and hopefully can fill this with even more text. As you know, changing subjects is very hard to do, I hate it, on that topic, I also hate some writing! On the topic of writing I have terrible grammar in my writing. Grammar is annoying, and often people are judged based on that. I wish that we could make grammar simpler and less important. At the end of this, you will see how stupid it was that you read this whole thing, you also have to deal with how many commas there're. I like many a neat words like I'd've. Words are pretty neat in some cases, but some are pretty annoyingly long, there're people who fear long words, a fear called Hippopotomonstrosesquippedaliophobia. There, I said it, and this may or may not be the end...surprise! It's not! Did you know that there's a thing in repair work called stuff, and it's not just general stuff. There is 4 types of stuff, one is insulating stuff, one is stuff for large spaces, one is stuff for small spaces, and one for something, I forget at the moment. Anyway, this may or may not be the end...Surprise! It is!]]

!! Audit:

* My son doesn't give a shit about engineering. My suggestion is pure mathematics or tradeskills at this point.
* My daughter is encouraging to her brother. I am [[grateful]].
* I think my wife continues to come to grips with our offspring's choices to fail. She's done everything she could. This is such an expensive place for her too.
** It hurts watching them choose to fail.
* I like that I offer some physical descriptions; reminds me of taking pictures.
* My daughter has a "yeah whatever" attitude at this point. Her comments about my wiki are humorous.
* My son is getting sucked into video games. I hear that. I hope he can do so functionally. My predictions aren't happy ones.
** Interesting to see gaming almsot completely drop off for my daughter. May she read real books instead! That's what you are really looking for, love. I know it's a missing piece of your puzzle.
* Walks with my offspring have strengthened what we can say and do here. 
* My wife appears to be settling into more of a groove. 
* Extended family joins us. It's dope. 
* Our stories appear to be pretty stable.
