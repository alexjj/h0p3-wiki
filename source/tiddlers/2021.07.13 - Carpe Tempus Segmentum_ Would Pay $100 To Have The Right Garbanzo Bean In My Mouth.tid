title: 2021.07.13 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Would Pay $100 To Have The Right Garbanzo Bean In My Mouth

Woke at 2:30? Dreams. Lo'n'behold, a flash. [[TTTOTW]]. A prayer too.

She's up. Good spirits. Walked me through her meetings. More flexibility in scheduling than before Covid, but hard to predict significant chunks of remote (a dream to work on). 

Toast. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Hugs'n'bugs, droning encouragement. [[TTTOTW]]. Repeat. 

I can see why my wife is tired of presenting on her topic. It's common sense made manifest.

Final hugs'n'bugs. Back to the lair, [[The Den]] of Evil. [[TTTOTW]]. Cleaning. Laundry. [[TTTOTW]]. It hit me. Sleep, noon?

Sleep until 2? A huge lightning storm. I've waited a while for this one. A flurry of chats with [[Root Users]]. 3. I am quite surprised. The odds are very low. I blame Saint Hegel, [[Chatlogs]], and the CIA. [[TTTOTW]].

//The Walk// with my offspring was dope AF. We bought Arizona cans. Vapelyfe. Talked our asses off. Everyone was in a good mood. These are conversations I [[hope]] we get to have for the rest of our lives. I know we might not. Probably not even. We're lucky to get it while gettin's good. Hauntology, schoolwork, thinking about our many neighbors, our feminine characteristics, shit...I don't remember. Tons. Brain no work.

//The Walk// with mi amor. People are still coming to terms with the poverty she comes from. They do not understand how it pervades. Planning. The open source textbook and social requirements for the MDiv application process rather than the promotion (which is in the bag, could write it up in a day and have at least 95% of chance of it being accepted). It would be weird to have written the book that was used to teach the class she would be a student in. Also, Greek. You already know Hebrew, your professors were OT scholars, you fangirl on the other side, and since you aren't going for a specialty beyond praxis, broadening your knowledge and focusing on the sections most pertinent to the work you are going to do means: Greek. Her argument for auditing makes sense. Maximizing electives is the way to go. It is rare that I think anyone my wife's equal; she would be in her element running with the horses here. Still, the textbook first takes the path that A set out too, opens the door for SZ's retirement to be eased, and it fits access services quite well. Could probably pick up SPARC and PhD in LIS otw. Nothing but good choices, but there are order preferences. Maybe, the woman should do dialectical bibliotherapy, but she fucking hates cogsci =/. She's going to slowly kill the yellow jackets instead of poisoning them. Also, we have a yellow rose in garden.

She chilled downstairs with me. Thinking more about [[DeathOfRobinhood]]'s piece. Showed me her gallery. Memento mori.

[[Family Gathering]] sans [[5c0ut]] (not in the mood to be with people lately). I had yesterday meal again, and it hit the spot. We paused many times in //Arrested Development// to talk. It's fucking [[art]], and we all know it. So much to discuss. My daughter enjoys it until she doesn't; we hit the fundamental questions yet again. All roads lead to [[it]], madame.
