Human defense mechanisms:

* Isolation
** including repression of disturbing and destructive thoughts and feelings;
* Anchoring
** The establishment of higher meanings and ideals...God, the Church, the State, morality, fate, the law of life, the people, the future. Anchoring provides us with illusions that secure psychological comfort. The shortcoming of anchoring is the despair we feel upon discovering that our anchoring mechanism is an illusion;
* Distraction
** The focusing of our thoughts and energy on a certain idea or task to prevent the mind from self-reflection
* Sublimation
** A type of defense mechanism in which negative urges are transformed into more positive actions. For instance, we distance ourselves from the tragedy of our existence and transform our awareness into philosophy, literature and art.
