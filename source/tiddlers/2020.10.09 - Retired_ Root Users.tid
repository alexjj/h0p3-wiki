//Accountably decentralizing personal autonomy is hard. In the relevant pursuit of [[The Salient]], lexically order and prioritize your multi-agent Williamsian weighing; consider your permissions structures with dimensionality. These are the stakeholders+shareholders of my identity. May they virtuously and [[straussian]]ly be Guilds-Creature Navigators, Mentat Senpai Confidants, and Members of The Justified Strain of The Bene Gesserit. May you be kaleidoscopically [[beautiful]] [[irwartfrr]]. May I practice what I preach, say as I do and do as I say, dialectically atone and grow, and reach for [[The Good]] as wisely as we can muster. Who do you think I am? Who do you think I should become? This isn't a webring, it's a lifeweb.//
