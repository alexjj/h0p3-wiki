title: 2021.09.07 - T-Money: A New Lease On Life

"""
Hey homo.
lmao! =)
How are you doing, homie?
I think I'm living my best life?
How are you doing?
Whoa, noice.
How's that?
I'm hanging in there. Been reading and writing my ass off. Spending more and more time locked in my basement, losing my mind. It's amazing.
My Dale Gribble transformation is almost complete.
Hahah. I have been spending all. My time in my garage.
I suppose that makes you Hank, assuming you've spent a proper amount of time on your lawn.
How are the girls doing?
And, what have you been up to in your garage?

Livin' the dream, sir.
It's almost Zen Redneck Gangster with intimacy.
Haha. Right. I am getting an implant. So toothless [[T-Money]] is kinda funny too
Cool. Still look prettier than I do.
I see a picture of your mother. She seems very happy in that image.
Indeed. You are correct.
She finished chemo and radiation earlier this year.
She is doing well. Taking immunotherapy
Good.
Feels way better.
Still fighting cancer but the oncologist is very positive in it being curable.
Dope.
I hope it will be a new lease on life for her.
I know we bought time. And I'll take that. Me and mom's are very close.
It is. Finally.
dude when i talked to at the begining of the year i was comming off a 3 year addiction. my mom had cancer and i thought she was gonna die. fuck we all did
its amazing how my parents have rebounded and are now talking about the future.
you can imagine how incrediable that feeling is. to hear my mom and step dad talk about their future.
Helluva year.
dude i havent worked a legit job since january
`/high-5`
but i put picks of me with money cause i took them for my wife. lol
this month im making bank out of the garage.
getting stoned and fixing small engines
That is you, sir. Might be heaven.
seems too real to be true.
i am subsidized with medicare and not recording my income.
its the only way i can do it.
as a startup
for now.
I hope it will bring great peace to your family and community.
I can imagine being able to use cannabliss once again has made life significantly better.
How are your girls doing?
i did start ssri anti depressiants. im afraid alot of my bubbly positivity is steemed from the fact the medicine is chaning my brain chemicals
Whatever works, my friend.
everyone is doing good man. kiddo started 6th grade and found out she was cooler than she thought.
good point right?
yes THC has again saved my soul in this life.
it isnt the first time.
lol
like you keep the ketamine. i keep the THC. and i havent had a sober day in months. lmao. but no alcohol. no kratom.
2/3rds of the way to being an adult. Gonna fly by.
Makes sense to me.
And, your wife, is doing alright? She enjoy having you back at the house more?
yeah. she is good. she says dont stop taking my meds and keep smoking weed...
lol
Best wife is best wife, homie.
you know i sacrified alot of my soul to the corporate machine for several years.
lol
May it regenerate quickly.
im thankful that paid off in the form of me being able to spend time with my mom.
went to GA the other week. filled a big 30 yard dumpster of trash out of the house in the basement.
my paretns house.
they also got their fifth wheel moved over to their property.
A fresh start for them too.
i ran 125' of massive 50amp 4 wire cable for their RV from the electrical box.
the wire alone was like $600. but they got the work done for free. alot of work.
lol. never done that before.
blazed out my head. hahaha
Always a blessing to be of service to one's family.
how are your kiddos?
is your oldest done with college yet?
Seems like your soul searching has paid off, considerably. Found what you felt you sacrificed.
jk
Naw, I am officially no longer their teacher, though they are required to walk with me everyday, do shit around the house, and work on computing projects. I'd say they've fallen behind even, but it's up to them now.
thats new
Hard to explain everything, but my daughter is learning the ropes of her autonomy, handing me my get-out-of-jail free card, accepting the implications of responsibility of her freedoms.
She has room to recover, even if she never goes to college.
dumb that down for me
lol
i smoke way too much weed to understand your magnificent brain.
She has to explicitly argue that I am not responsible for her choices, that she understands that she has to accept the consequences.
Naw, I'm never clear enough, lol. I really do talk gibberish all day.
ive read your wiki.
If she doesn't do her work, she can't blame me for it.
its a hard read
just one artilce
lol
gotcha. mine is hormonal af dude.
we are constantly either yelling at each other or hugging each other or listening to music.
Yeah. That is a very fair assessment of my daughter as well.
And, I'm no picnic to spend hours with, lol.
yeah. thats a tought time. samantha got their early.
nah. unfortunatly my kid likes to argue as much as i do.
but she is a child and knows nothing.
I hope it will be of great value to her.
so all i can do is try to teach and lecture.
but you know. half of what goes in...
Yes, sir. I know that feeling, lol.
we click on music. she is still singing
she sang at a kareoke bar in downtown nashville on a friday night?
!
suppose to be exclimation
I bet that was outstanding, house on fire.
kid is kicking ass in jujitsu too
Heck yeah. I'm glad she hasn't quit.

She nailed it. Got an Adele, Amy Winehouse kinda thing with her voice. A good range for her age.
11.5 years old
she dont look like it
hahaha
She's probably be tall.
thanks man. as a dad i couldnt be prouder. it is fun to see her develop her own voice
5'5" 130lbs of solid muslce
lol
Gonna be a fierce singing JJ fighter.
and punches harder than most grown men.
lol
If do right, no can defend.
how is your son and your wife doing?
My son is quickly becoming the tallest person in the house, not there yet. He's 13. He's been socializing more. He has worked on his self-regulation. He's out of the pit, I think. We think alike pretty often, very similar senses of humor.
i can brag on my kid all day. shes still a straight bitch to me 50% of the time. haha
Lol. Well, I think that is part of the joy somehow. I think your jaw would drop to hear some of the things my daughter says. She is a razor.
that is awesome to hear that you two think alike and share humor!
mine cut me so bad i made my wife help parent the situation
lol
Yeah, I hear that.
she said as arguing about pickel juice i think. "well this isnt even your house, its in mommas name, so you dont get to say what goes on in this house."
dropped me bro.
That is a crucial joke in our house as well.
we did aquire it after we married. but its kathys house.
I was explicit about having it in my wife's name.
i would never take it in a divorice or anything.  not even half. im not that kinda guy...
i can live in a fucking tent. long as wife and kiddo is safe. yea know?
I hear that.
Basement and garage preferred, ofc.
granted. id prolly just stay in my camper that it right outside my garage. lol. with a queen bed.
it has running water when hooked up. lol
garage is no a/c
Long as it had a computer, I could see it.
been brutal but im fucking sweating it out man.
Maybe that will change in time.

Outstanding.
hahaha. im high af. and look it
they let me work on airplanes. you believe that.
hahaha
haha, I do.
i apologize for not keeping up.
i have been in big trasition as you can see
i am starting to feel some stability
You are all good, dude. I completely understand.
We connect when we do.
you know how it goes.
i keep eyeballing that letter
that i never finished to you.
i think im gonna start over.
its like 3 years old
lol
XD.
its saved on the documents on this laptop. thats why ive been eyeballing it.
I've still got some of those myself. It's rare that I write them these days.
how is your communication with the outside world?
Oh, my wife has been extremely busy. Balls to the wall. She's auditing Greek so that she can begin her MDiv there (a dream come true for us).
you arent full dale gribble are you?
I'm in [[Reply Mode]]. I respond, but rarely initiate except when I am convinced it is morally obligated.
thats amazing dude!
about your wife.
Yeah, it is.
and if i knew it was like that
i would bother you everyday
You are free to. I do my best to respond to all people.
im kinda annoyingly bubbly and positive now.
Naw, lol. I'm glad to hear it.
me too. but its like i have to open others up to it. been down a dark road the last couple of years.
fuck. seems like everyone kinda has.
not like im alone... lol in that.
Yeah, that is true.

It does the job.
Cooler in the summer, which is probably the most important part to me.
I like having the chance to be up at all hours and walk while I think.
that is awesome
im so glad you have that space for you
desk looks great. i am never that organized.lol
I like having the extra space. It only look neater ceause of that.
