** I hope you'll be able to make dozens of these a day without sweating too much some day.

** vvvvvvvvvv? 
*** Reminds me of your secretive depth in symbolization. 
**** I think this is one of my curses upon you: I have taught you to study the concept of secrets. Lawd, so much of what I understand revolves around this disclosing.

** Again, a powerful argument. I have to warn you that many people will not be able to completely follow that line of reasoning. So many people do not recognize the implications of what you've said. I don't know where to begin.
*** Will your Discord buddies understand this? I am glad that you are capable of continuing the conversation branches to map others to the territory. You have quite a gift.

** I could not have said it that well. We reach places where I'm not qualified to say more beyond: good job. Good job.

** How much symbolism do you impart to your characters?
*** I often see streaks of the reality around you in your work. Wholesale replications in some cases.
*** It's interesting to see that you sometimes have so much secretive depth to your creation.
** There are good reasons to despise "happy endings" in stories. I agree. There's something more to it than a problem of "laziness" (or it is a kind of laziness that is more problematic than it initially appears, imho). 
*** I suppose you want a book that is interesting. I am shocked. =). Maybe it's like [[vidya]] [[games]] to me. Parts of what make a story interesting often have so little to do with whether it has a happy or sad ending to it, as though there's a structural ludological component that is the real star of the show to my eyes.
**** Good storytelling must surely weave them all (and, I know not how).
** #ATCH? 
*** I think the need to create characters in our lives is a lonely thing sometimes. I am glad you do it. It's also one of the ways in which we can ideally relate to anyone. I [[hope]] it is a source of comfort and relief for you.
*** I like the idea of redesigning your characters. I hope you keep the drafts, see the evolution.
** Ares and I have a lot in common.

** Your ability to express yourself, to blackbox test and reverse engineer yourself, and to autonomously cooperate with me continues to improve year-over-year. Thank you.
