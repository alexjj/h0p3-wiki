** Don't fret. Recall, you can shadow your sister here too. When I'm on the job (at any job), I'm thinking about how the best person on that job is doing their job, and I ask myself [[W5H]]. At least a 60% exploration is merited when they are active mentors and participants in your life (and, I would be highly inclusive here), including the sociopaths.
** I am glad to see you punching above your weight-class here. Throw down. You will climb this mountain.
*** Write about what went wrong. Post-mortem the dead body. Investigate, breh. Talk trash and sing praises. Pick out what mattered.
*[[Fall 2020: Elective]]
** So, please think about it. Ask yourself why you are doing this bullshit. Surely, it is mere busy-work! XD.
*[[Fall 2020: Science]]
** When you are asked to complete a task, it will be valuable to ask "to what end?" [[gfwiwcgws]]
*[[Fall 2020: Civics]]
** Do you know why you are doing this?
*[[Fall 2020: Social Studies]]
** I'm glad to see you doing this.

** Nevermind the ambiguity of "can," do you think milk ought to be "considered one of the most important findings in the world?" Why should we agree?
** I think the intent of the question is for the would-be-author to provide some imaginative, hilarious expression of the world, though not necessarily the most relevant interpretation (I mean: it's gotta be socially acceptable, amirite?).
*** Recall that a state of affairs might be modeled as a set of propositions (each have some set of properties) that map onto the semantic world. (Though we must question this carefully:) They must be either true or false, and they must be necessarily or contingently so. Good fiction will tend to modify some set of contingent truths in that set and then map the chain reactions in all contingent truths of that state of affairs to provide a novel setting (one that should also be a fundamental theme) that enables us to make judgments about all possible worlds or our own particular possible world (however bizarre or mundane, there will be a lens or a mirror of The Real emerging [though we can obviously be wrong]). 
**** Change this contingent truth, what are the effects that you would see? I bet you could paint us a wild picture here. Go absurd and funny if you want. Take it far. Imagine it and explain what you see and why.

** You didn't flesh it out, but it's not empty. I appreciate that, sir.
*[[2020.08.04 – Antipleonasm Analysis: Candle and darkness]]
** I adore your interpretation. Perhaps you'd need to read the entire piece to know how it fits in that context, but I think you've taken the metaphor to exactly where it's supposed to go. Consciousness is about perceptual filtering (and the justified epistemic construction of filters) to some non-trivial [[dok]]: picking out the [[salience]] requires other things to fade out (and, this is as ancient a problem as it gets). The dialectic shows up beautifully here, aye?
*** I think you would strengthen the argument by removing the metadiscussion and instead flesh out your thesis here. You wrote the kernel, but now you have to build out the living extensions and supports of the kernel for the rest of us. You know why that's important, but you didn't say anything about it!
*** If you were to re-draft this (and I think it's fine to leave it as is), that's where you would go with it. Instead, in the future, I want you to develop the argument as the evidence required to answer your own metacognitive question with some confidence.
**** I'd be floored by evidence of an argument that fell apart that you went on to present as a failed experiment in reasoning too! It's super important that a significant percentage of your approaches fail (otherwise, you aren't trying hard enough in some sense).
***** Very often, why you think it failed will present something positive to continue the inquiry too. Almost ex nihilo, Negation Intro buys you material, son!  
*[[2020.08.04 – Carpe Diem: Book noises]]
** Sound vanilla and plain. Days feeling plain? I get that too. Just remember to look at my earlier [[CTS]] entries (and some of my recent too). This is definitely going to happen. This is a signal for ya.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** [[2019.08.05 – Print Reading: Little to write]] is delightful, and [[2019.08.05 – Prompted Introspection: Education]] is, of course, something I agree to. You have some good work last year here. I'm glad to see it.
