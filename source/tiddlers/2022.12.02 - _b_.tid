The irony of the postmodern commitment to non-commitment: perhaps sometimes the only kindness available is to point and laugh (with or without resentment*). Ha. No, no, ~~shut the fuck up~~ ^^you're right, that makes sense, cool story^^, lmao. =(

Just remember: conformity to the will of others is always wrong and inauthentic. Caring about others for their own sake means you've not cared enough about yourself. Also, don't conform to this line of reasoning or sentiment.

Perhaps the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 causes me to experience exbodiment, a state of cognition characterized by a collaboration between my mind and the environmentally sourced matter, in which it almost acts as an agential collaborator and not merely a mechanical servant. However, don't let it do the thinkin' for ya (or think that it can); let it aid you in doing it yourself as a cybernetic extension of yourself. But, I do think it is a radical extension of our identities. It's not merely a machine when it's a limb extending from my crucial organ (and I would argue others' organs as well).
