title: 2021.03.02 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Devourable Oomph Among Dogs, Pigs, & Humans

-=[ Rabbitholed ]=- [[TTTOTW]] late into the night. Pretty manic. Bouncing between projects, one thing reminding me of another.

Sleep was not enough. My head was on fire when I woke up, my eye popping out, ruminations and racing, but...I did knock one out eventually (best way to let it go sometimes). `<fistpumps!>` Unfortunately, due to my lethargy, I missed the boat today! `<unfistpumps>`. It's okay. 

Talked with [[K]]. Asked me about how to label what "this is." I think it was a fruitful conversation. He's got a new FX CPU and a PSU to install on his machine. Should the opportunity arise, I recommend just upgrading to newest AMD CPUs, sir (night and day).

Hugs'n'bugs. Offspring just deliver the bad news up front to me. Alrighty. Well, I respect your honesty toward me. Thank you. Assigned tasks, projected the remainder of the day.

My wife has non-trivial ups and downs in her today. Extra bitchiness, y u m. Aaaaaaaaaaand, I was right again (though low confidence). `/high-5`. Cool enough, I called it not on her irrationality this time though (although I detected this afterward), rather I called it on mine! LMAO. It felt like you were ovulating. Slave to that devourable oomph. Indeed, my senses detect thy hawtness. Your gynecologists have all been correct about you. You were born to breed.<<ref "a">> Speaking of which, she wore my dress today (it's been over 4 months!), and I am denied. Oy. Phooey. You did that on purpose. `/bites-lip`

[[Fitness Routine]]. My hip thrusts and gyrations are on point. Round person trying to be less round.

//The Walk// was quiet and quite good. Adults barely said anything. Wind piercing with snow melting into dirty piles. Offspring chattered the entire way while we interjected where fitting and watched for dogs, pigs, and humans. My daughter, of course, really does sound more and more like her mother. Thank god she don't sound like me (sadly, as you know, almost no one would take you seriously then, babe).

[[MTG]] matches with my offspring. My son's Affinity +1/0, 0/+1 vs MUC, and I barely lose both games. Good job, asshole. =). I did make a mistake `/sigh`, failed to take an identified attack ornithopter (I adore her tits and dick) while instead trying to save a point of damage off memnite, and it was just enough to redzone me. I deserved to lose that one. Daughter's Affinity vs WWEnchantress +4/0, +3/1, +3, wherein I drew 0/20 enchantments in 10 turns with fucking Emeria and two chanters active, then took one with a single land and a handful of 1cc, and then triple Emp with a Kor in play (and just a tad too much pressure for her to gain footing, peddling to even stabilize...but, the handicap tempo gap is huge, the value highly variant, and it's difficult to predict here). 

Shopping @ W-Entity con mi hermano. Picked up personal items for him (good luck, my ninja), and stuff to make sushi and sashimi. 

//Skintime//, pulled her off work for it (you are done, you've done more than enough already!). We watched a Yale talk about a particular scroll from the second temple with a lot of conjecture (good stuff) that I fell asleep too (not because I was bored but because I was so fucking sleepy). I want to do this more, please.

Fireman Time! (Enjoy the fuzzy blanket*) For the second dozenth time (it's so very rare) in my life, I used my phone. 

[[Family Gathering]]. Holy fuck, we had fresh sushi. I'm pretty sure there's nothing he can't make, lol. Unfortunately, we got rid of the correct tools when we moved up from JC, but he improvised with bad tools. We destroyed it, lol. Vapelyfe and talking. My son had a serious moment where he started to lose his composure after explaining that he's feeling anxious about us all looking at him at the same time when trying to figure out what was wrong before (like an amplification, unfortunately); but, a minute later, everything was good.

[[TTTOTW]]

-=] 8 Hz WAN IP [=- is coming back. Forgot, oil blackdrop.*<<ref "g">> Sent folks to bed. Let the record show that in the past two days, I've stolen 4 kisses (your coldsore is gone, woman!) from her virtuous habituation* (you got good default behavior woman), and then the look of "omg, we weren't supposed to do that: you did it again!" on your face as I chase you for more. Waiting a week is pure hell.
