title: MTG Deck: The One Long To Rule Them All

//Approximately The Best Goblin Deck Of All Time, even in the `Pay To Win On The Play Die Rolling Rock+Paper+Scissors?.metagame`. One of the more soothing decks to goldfish. `/salute` Smmenen. //

It's absurdly smooth. Pretty sure color saturation is more valuable than converted mana generation after practice (sometimes more fun to practice with 4-6 cards in hand, pretend you mulled hard [note that you can win T1 on the draw with a mull to 1!]). Yawgmoth's Will was surprisingly "weak" for the slots. Note that you can win by just ACalling your opponent to death (aside, it really is an honorary conditional mana source). Plenty of ways to win in style, and that likely is where the remaining work should be poured. How can we make the sideboard as [[Leet]] AF?

Probably the real one, but it's not as fun to play. There's at least a chance to win on the draw in the presumed metagame:
