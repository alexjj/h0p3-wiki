title: 2021.08.19 - Prompted Introspection: Shaming A Wrongthink

!! Are there any thoughts so offensive that you would advocate shaming those who think them, even if they don't act on those thoughts?

Offensive [[gfwiwcgws]]? I think shaming can be an unobviously broad concept as well as sometimes an indirect activity.<<ref "i">> One can do a wrongthink, and thinking and in-action are actions. We are sometimes long-term responsible for having had the thoughts, feelings, and desires that we do through habituation (many choices over time), and if we are choosing not to act on those thoughts not for moral reasons, then they may be shameworthy. There's a difference between shaming someone's immediate mental states vs. larger timeslices of their [[4DID]] as well. Not selecting said mental states as one's motivation for external behavior, however, is a non-trivial buffer (often extremely commendable, to my blind eyes), and I'd prefer we don't shame in these cases (it's already so difficult to infer intention). Of course, we aren't always responsible for our mental states, and there are cases in which we ought to think about and simulate shameful thoughts. 

Further, if it is mere simulation (a necessary part of our imaginations, creativity, problem-solving, and being Dasein), I'm not convinced  any such bracketed thought (including the exceptions you want to name) is impermissible prima facie.<<ref "t">> [[Question Everything]] requires that there is at least one case for any given mental state in which it is permissible to simulate and inspect it (and this is likely too minimal a claim!). Thinking about (even being entertained by the thought of) evil is not necessarily evil (it can be).<<ref "p">> So, perhaps there may be cases in which shame could or should be advocated, but my gut instinct is to hedge against shaming in these cases as much as I can, [[WINTCIS]]. I admire that people are willing to spend some of their mental resources to ponder without feeling committed to it (as long as it is in service to being committed to what matters).

I find most shame-tactics executed in the world quite shameworthy. Justified shaming is uncommon (and lying nearly ubiquitous); most have no interest in justification. Shaming comes in such a wide variety,<<ref "h">> and I think we must be highly selective (though we must engage in the process; it's part of being a political animal<<ref "l">>). We can shame parts without shaming the whole (and, in almost all cases, that is all that is ever permitted). We often can argue with someone without ostracizing, disowning, outgrouping, or even being in any other way violent toward them, and we can attempt to minimize shaming to fit the moral crime as well. I prefer that arguments do the shaming,<<ref "g">> that we are given room to [[change]], that we still break bread together no matter fucking what, and that we put our skin all the way in the game. 

This is an important question to me. As a [[wrastler|Wrestle]], I'm extra accountable to this problem. I have to suss out why someone believes what they do (often on few clues in mere minutes), and whether or not they [[aim]] to do the right thing in how they choose to think. I go hard (💯) with everyone.<<ref "a">> If I don't like your argument, you have the chance to know it (and in a circumlocutory and systematic fashion often enough). I have to deal with shame in many directions. I think the transparency of the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱, itself quite an experiment, comes right up to this line constantly. [[/b/]] pushes the boundaries hard (and it continues to leak).
