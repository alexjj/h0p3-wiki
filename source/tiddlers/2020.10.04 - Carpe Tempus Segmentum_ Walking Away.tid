title: 2020.10.04 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Walking Away

Maybe he's not sick, but I have too hard a time imagining that could be suppressed by this administration. Would he lie about something like that (e.g. to get out of debating?)? Sure. If he's breathing, he's lying somewhere. Either way, I couldn't desire his infection any higher. 

* Read+Write
* Sleep by ?
* Woke by 11:30
* Inform the Men!
* Meditation
* Shower of the gods!
** my farts destroy
* Read+LoL
* Everyone was down to prep (though no one took it, sadly)
** My offspring drive me insane.
* [[Family Time]] @ 2
* 1-on-1s
** farts continuet to destroy
** My son would turn for a second to write while we talked.
* [[TTP]]s
** Daughter continues to fail. I have done what is in my power. Sometimes it feels like 200 weeks of mostly failure, and now I officially predict another 200 weeks of the same. It's her choice.
*** I fail at least 30% of my students, and she's going to be one of them. Smartest girl I have ever met in my life, wasted. 
** Son didn't have his wiki set despite everything. They don't care what I think that much (well, not enough to act on it), and now I just build the case against them. Proofs have been there for a while. The consequences are theirs.
** I'll walk and listen to them lie to me. We'll do philosophy, and maybe a decade from now they'll figure out too late. They will hear my case every single day while they live with me. It's probably going to be an unpleasant story. My job will be to carve out the negative space.
*** I still have more hope for my son at this point. I suppose my hope is that they will find a way to be reborn in some sense, that they'll make use of a foundation we've sacrificed for.
* Break
* Vapelyfe
* Read Our Wikis
** My wife's wiki was the only one that interested me.

** Mostly broke up into offspring and parents. They wanted to talk about their RPs. Fine with me. Leave me alone with her.
* [[Family Log]]
* Cooked ravioli and garlic bread with my daughter
* Hugs
* Sleep by 10:30
** Wow. =)
