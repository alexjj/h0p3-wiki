07:09:19 PM [[freedomemu]]: There is quite the hypertextual rabbit hole here, I am entertained and inspired
10:49:28 PM [[h0p3]]: I didn't see this until now. Thank you.
10:49:42 PM [[h0p3]]: I'm glad it could serve both purposes.
10:50:49 PM [[h0p3]]: If you happen to have your own site or other media, I would gladly read, watch, or listen, and think about it.
12:16:16 AM [[h0p3]]: Are you a fan of WoW?

10:34:28 AM [[freedomemu]]: Not really... I'm not diligent enough to document my own thoughts like that in a wiki... tho I do make music.
10:43:48 AM [[h0p3]]: Oh. Well, I'd be happy to listen to it.
10:44:15 AM [[h0p3]]: I'm always on the hunt for my [[Music: Library]].
10:44:38 AM [[h0p3]]: How long you been making music?

11:36:07 PM [[freedomemu]]: Vocally, my entire life. Messed with cassette tape recording as a kid. Digitally since like 2003. Serious production since about 2011.

Thank you, sir. That's a snappy site. I like your {[[Focus]]} on instrumental music too. I'm especially fond of your RPi [[vidya]]s.
