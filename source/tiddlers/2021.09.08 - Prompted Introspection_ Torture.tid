title: 2021.09.08 - Prompted Introspection: Torture

!! Is torture ever permissible?

Define torture, please. There may be thought experiments in which given certainty of the state of affairs and consequences, any finite torture would be permissible. That isn't the world we access in practice though. I think there are some kinds of torture that may never be permissible to execute given our [[fff]] circumstances, except that it may be permissible to choose to subject oneself to it in some cases.

I am highly accountable to this problem of coercively inflicting pain in [[others]], [[WINTCIS]]. It is one of the reasons I have worked to be so transparent. I wish all problems could be solved through attraction.

Scaling defection must sometimes be met with scaling defection. It is the ugliest thing about The Golden Rule I can think of. It turns my stomach inside and out, and that's why one of my gut instincts is to forgive anyone who refuses to commit violence for any reason; that desire is something we must all appreciate. Yet, I often uncover the reason for this attitude to be selfish one, an excuse to be an apolitical hedonistic, to lie to themselves and pretend they are mere children and helpless victims after they've come to understand the implications of good and evil in the world given their place in it. Who doesn't want to ignore it? It is much easier to mask it in humility and either deny our responsibility or select activities that don't really cost us anything. It is immoral to not be violent in many cases we encounter in the world, and it may scale up to cost us our own lives and Hursthousianly Marr us.<<ref "w">> Even the virtuous agent is generally damned to have blood on their hands in our ~~shoes~~ gloves.<<ref "j">> The hedged-conservative goal of limiting coercion to the point of quadratic personal sacrifice is something I hold in high regard though.

I straight up hate (as at least dis[[like]]) sufficiently crucial sections of almost every adult I meet,<<ref "t">> but I've gotta [[love]] them. I've been forcibly steeped in our species from a young age.<<ref "h">> I've enough practice sizing people up to regularly predict behaviors (no small feat for an autist), I'm non-trivially skilled in picking out what is [[salient]] in us, and I have what I believe to be sufficient evidence of their intentions (it is usually the case that I understand their argument better than they do). I'm tired of being proven correct again and again and again and again. I don't think most people deserve to breathe, but I aint gonna push the button, and I [[hope]] to avoid violence as best I can. Unfortunately, it is still my job to [[wrestle]], because: people do [[change]] and they need [[help]] doing it (including myself). As any parent knows, good praxis empathy often requires punishing or even torturing ourselves to have earned the right to compassionately deliver pain (even something as simple as CBT); we must have fitting reasons to think we know what that pain means and why it must be delivered. Most wilt when they come to realize what I expect of us. Who would want to live such a life? Nobody wants to be a martyr.<<ref "e">>

Oh, it is very easy for me to tell you that I respect the dignity of your personhood. That is a given.<<ref "i">> It is much rarer for me to tell you I respect anything else about what you've done with it or what I think you'll likely do with it. That's my job as a wrestler though. Part of filtering for [[salience]] in cultivation boils down to weeding and pruning processes wherein I work to negate, reductio, deconstruct, diagnose, and deliver the medicine, amputations, or killing existential blows. I'm the mean teacher too many people need; I have to quietly (its own problematic in this ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱) tell them they are bad people here or there regarding this or that (and why), sometimes I can use a blanket, sometimes it must be straight to their faces, but I prefer to maximize their [[privacy]] and minimize pain (that's what I'd want). I have to tell people what nobody else can or will tell them: the torturing truth (as best as we can understand it).<<ref "w2">> The odds of success are low, but I triage in my attempt to convert lost causes or shortcut their 10-20k cost down to 1-2k. [[WINTCIS]][[irwartfrr]].

[[Hope]] is its own torture.<<ref "o">>
