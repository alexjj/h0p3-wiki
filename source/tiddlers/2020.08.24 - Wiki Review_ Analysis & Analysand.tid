title: 2020.08.24 - Wiki Review: Analysis & Analysand

* [[2020.08.23 - Wiki Review: Signaling A Schizo]]
** I'm [[grateful]] that I have the opportunity to speak with the neurodiverse. Difference is quite expensive.
* [[2020.08.23 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Blister Pop]]
** Completed. As usual, I do not know how to interpret his stories well enough. Perhaps it's all in my head, but sometimes they remind me of telescopic prophesies, dogwhistles, and simulated metaphors.
* [[2020.08.23 - TDL: Discord Admins R Gone, Post Memes In #General]]
** The modeling gap between what goes on in my head and what I am able to translate onto the wiki continues to grow, of course.
** What an odd approach. It's probably incoherent. Back to the day-of. Well, I'll keep testing.
* [[2020.08.23 - Prompted Introspection: Mediation]]
** Completed. Seems like such a blah question, but that is part of the goal of [[Prompted Introspection]] as I understand it. Considering the amount of time I've poured into this activity, it would be absurd not to keep the question.
* [[2020.08.23 - Family Log: second degree burn]]
** Without me to drive us, this doesn't get done. I am, unfortunately, the motivating force for unfun parts of our lives.
** It is impressive how much was lost in translation in the RP. I read it a dozen times or so. I wonder if they will see it differently in years to come (if they would look at all).

** I do wonder if I've met this person before, but I paranoically wonder that about so many anons I am lucky to meet.
** Hoping he's kicking ass on his computer and playing vidya games with his boys. 
*** I'm Sirlinical in my approach to gaming (spoke with them at length long ago when I was wee lad; interesting person): i.e. I'm not fun to game with.
