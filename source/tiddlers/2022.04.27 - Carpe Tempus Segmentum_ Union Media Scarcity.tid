title: 2022.04.27 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Union Media Scarcity

Woke at 8:30. Meditation. //Skintime// with my sympaticon, planning, [[Morning Routine]]. A flood of messages. [[Tochka Market]] asking for help. A wild HospitalElectrician appears...[[TTTOTW]] + [[D2]]. //Altered Carbon// + Leftovers.

Worked on the lawn and house a bit. We've spread a kind of fabric down on the edge of the house to kill off the plantlife and allow mulch. This is where we'll be placing our plants and perhaps eventually greenhouses or trellises. Found the ground wiring, and it was loose. Fixed. [[1uxb0x]] (who really still isn't on the ball with his phone uptime, updates, and control) worked with me to check and see if we could improve the water pressure on the hose. Seemed off. Found the valve, and it does make it a working hose (meanwhile my daughter finished up the red portion of the door). Unfortunately, it appears there is a leak in the valve at some point, and that the person who sold the house knew that. I'd like to fix that. 

Watched //The Big Short// with my offspring. Less to talk about on this run, but it was even more engaging, I'd say. Still had to [[pause]] often to [[wrestle]] with it or about it (it failed to depict all the bad guys as bad guys, among other things). They are interested in diving further into it. Cool. Have more lined up. [[TTTOTW]]. A wild og_m4 appears...

Assignments. She's looking for jobs (and seems open to me working alongside her, as I think it would be useful to have me there to help her integrate). Should be going for driver's school this summer. They are both looking for interest groups that meet in person now that quarantine is mostly dead.

Prepped dinner with my sympaticon. Makes it simple. She offered to have me use her knife instead for the onions, as I won't cry to the point that my eyes just burn. 

No time to talk. //Inform the Men!// Shower of the gods! She slept soundly without anxiety meds, just CBD. It's clear that the summer Greek classes could not possibly prepare people well. She is going to take the test despite auditing. Skipped a pointless meeting that could be skipped: good. I'm hoping she'll continue to hack'n'slash through bullshit to make time for herself. A machine that works even when she's not there, preferably with 3-4 hours of serious work average, and the remaining devoted to the rest of her vocation (this may be a while).

[[5c0ut]] walked us through his interview for the executive chef position. He had previously sent me a pricing breakdown of his special meals (requested for this interview), and that's what he prepared for the owner in her kitchen (also a chef) with her dogs there. Nailed it, no surprises. Saturday is //stage// (free internship) day, the next interview hurdle. He'll run the kitchen with his specials alongside the other staff while proving he can also replicate the rest of menu. 

Toenails clipped. [[TTTOTW]]. Mi amor tuned her instrument.

[[Family Gathering]] was delicious. We had kielbasa, potatoes, onions, and cabbage. Meal was outstanding. Bit of chat about 2008 crash. We watched Cuddy's Mom Gets Dosed episode of //House//. We actually laughed hard. Vapelyfe. [[TTTOTW]].

[[D2]]. Halfway through 91 on NeckRomancer. We made 15 Insights, and now I've got an IG again. We've got a smoother run process and summon creation flow, so IG is back. Nihlathak runs are getting cleaner. I spent most of my time crafting, setting up the assassin, or [[TTTOTW]] between runs, catching up on the [[canvassing]]. I'm hoping to squeeze in 1-2 Nihlathak runs then LK before each Throne TP is up.

Put mi amor to bed. My sympaticon fell asleep on her own. [[5c0ut]] has also used the CBD to sleep. Those 3 are experimenting. I hope they get another good night of sleep.
