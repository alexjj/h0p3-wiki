My boss said "I know this will sound demeaning, but use your head for more than a hat rack".

That is cool AF.
Oct 13, 2020 8:27pm
Why are they letting you up in the air?
Oct 13, 2020 8:27pm
Maintence flights. Doing operations check. Pretty normal for me now. They had me in OH for a week helping another mechanic doing some maintenance and troubleshooting.

Please tell me you are so pro that you can just listen to the sound it makes and you know what's wrong, like Car Talk level.

Far from it. Usually just hoping I tightened all th boltha and didn't forget an oring so we don't crash and burn. Lol
Oct 13, 2020 8:31pm
The bolts*

Always being rushed.
Oct 13, 2020 8:32pm
I hear that. I can imagine I would be anxious. Even just working on my computer, there's a "breath hold" to see if it will post.
Oct 13, 2020 8:33pm
I've only being doing maintence on eurocopter for a few months. Most of these guys have several years of experience.
Oct 13, 2020 8:34pm
I bring alot to the table. But I'm also slow and methotical. Which they don't like so much in ems aviation. They want it don't super fast.
Oct 13, 2020 8:35pm
How are you and the fam?
Oct 13, 2020 8:42pm
I hope, in time, they will come to appreciate your methodical approach. That's one thing I look for in a lot of fields.

We are doing well. Daughter isn't on track, but it's not the end of the world. [[k0sh3k]]'s life has slowed down some. I've curled up, and that has been refreshing.
Oct 13, 2020 8:44pm
Calm before another storm, likely.
Oct 13, 2020 8:45pm
How about your girls?
Oct 13, 2020 8:45pm
Samantha just started back in person school this week. She is very happy to be out of the salon. Despite all. The extra requirements like masks and odd stuff!
Oct 13, 2020 8:46pm
She also started jujitsu, wrestling, and boxing training.
Oct 13, 2020 8:47pm
Fuck yeah!
Oct 13, 2020 8:47pm
I could not get my offspring interested enough in it.
Oct 13, 2020 8:47pm
My daughter spent some time with wraps practicing when she was young, but it wasn't her thing.
Oct 13, 2020 8:47pm
BJJ and Wrestling seem amazing. I think the learning to wrestle translates to so many places.
Oct 13, 2020 8:48pm
If she sticks with it, I think she'll be whoopin your ass in 7 years.
Oct 13, 2020 8:48pm
Very well could. She has only been to 4 practices and is doing well. Shebia 5'3" and like 105lbs. So she is much larger than all the kids in the progame. Tallest kid in her class. One of the tallest in her grade.
Oct 13, 2020 8:54pm
She's only 10 years old. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
