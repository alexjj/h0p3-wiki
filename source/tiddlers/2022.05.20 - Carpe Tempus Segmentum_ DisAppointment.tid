//Yet again, the ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî± generates a lot of complexity but also clarity in some hard places.//

[[D2]]. Twerk route to Mephisto is sufficiently short. So, I want to try to do both. We still have plenty of objects we'd use from Mephisto, especially perfected Rainbow Facets. I believe I can make a full drop shape on the LK run into DH2, but my current problem is that I'm on p8, and that is not easy for even a lvl 89 merc to tank with Insight. May try without, as I've a sick eth reaper's troll that may enable him to tank it. If not, I've gotta drop MF for damage, and that still may be problematic. I don't mind vendoring every round, and we'll gamble. ATMA calculator is needed, as Stormlash on p1 0MF is 1/120k or something stupid? Eh, 1/45k p8 200MF, 300 is 1/40k, 400 is 1/38k. Still might find this unsafe in the end, and I'm hard-pressed to drop MF on the necro. Harder pressed not to just continue the eternal grind for Ber which opens us up.

[[TTTOTW]]. Sleep by 1?

Woke at 10? Not good sleep. Had to get up in the middle of the night. Belly wasn't good, joints and muscle sore, and racing. 

[[TTTOTW]].

[[D2]]. My sympaticon [[shared]] some dark chocolate and moon pies (fresh).

[[TTTOTW]]. Assignments. 

A wild Thussy_connoisseur appears.

Painting. Room is lookin' odd now. Head to toe, an insane person did this. =D. Cleanup. I've got several more passes to do before it's done. It sucks working in such a small room with profound traffic that cannot stay clean (hair fucking everywhere).

Leftovers. [[TTTOTW]]. [[D2]]. Twerk found 2x Pul and a PB/Life skiller. Made a Stone for muh baba. [[TTTOTW]].

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. Her day was kinda crazy. Caught J in a direct, documented lie specifically about and with mi amor. Trying to find a way to let it go without it being a big deal. SZ will still have to know. She's got the hardest part of her conference presentation done. A cultist group has asked her to give a presentation on labyrinths, so that's pretty [[awe]]some (very specific, surprising they could find anyone to do it). //Inform the Men!// 

[[TTTOTW]]. Bad news on the tub: enamel may require a different kind of paint. I've probably wasted a considerable amount of time this week and in the coming week because of it.

[[JRE]] called. He took [[Bn]] to see his biomom, and it was perfectly awkward. [[JRE]] hugged her, but said he wasn't going to force [[Bn]] to do so (just wanted to signal to his boy that this woman was someone he was willing to show affection toward). Had contradictions he was wrestling with as he talked about this woman's jump from $11/hour to $17/hour at her new job, thinking about what her excitement meant (fatherhood is so immensely complex at this level, imho). Muhboi [[Bn]] is taking huge shits in the potty, and he's very proud of it (as he damned well should be: it's a real skill in life, sir). My brother is building the new machine (3080ti, 5600X, 64GB, 3 NVME slots), said my daughter should bring a hard drive to build in his old one. Thinking about what to bring and what to eat. I did my job: I listened. Told me more about [[Lauraceae]]'s story and wishing that she reached out to [[k0sh3k]] (more than myself, again*, understandably). He thought it a good idea that I write a [[letter]] to her. Yup. I can do that. 

[[TTTOTW]]. 

[[Family Gathering]] was delicious. My offspring made burgers and seasoned wedges. Stacked them. They were delicious. We watched The Prison episode of //House//. Very much enjoy it.

[[JRE]] called me up late. There's been some miscommunication. [[Rb]] feels uncomfortable with [[ASK]] coming for legal reasons, and she wants at least a background check. =/. I am surprised, but I can empathize with where she is coming from. Thought and talked about it. Unfortunately, I don't think [[ASK]] or I will be going. Ugh. I have a lot of emotions running through me. My goal is to salvage whatever we can here. My offspring can still go (and want to, ofc), so [[k0sh3k]] will be going as well. Sick to my stomach.

[[TTTOTW]]. [[D2]], one baal run, then we crafted 50 Caster ammys. Two +2nec/8%FCR/etc. I'm impressed with how many are prismatic. [[TTTOTW]]. Massage. [[TTTOTW]]
