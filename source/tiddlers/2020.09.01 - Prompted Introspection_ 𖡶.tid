title: 2020.09.01 - Prompted Introspection: ð–¡¶

!! Come up with a mathematical formula to express something you know/believe. (Example: Long Saturday run + Frappucino = Happiness)

Hrm. I cannot assign it to my satisfaction. âŠ™â˜¯ð–¡¶...? =D. More than math, more than what I can sign. Sure, it will only ever be a caveman's painting of the sun. I will set that aside for now. I [[hope]] when I come back to it, I'll feel like giving it a shot. I'll shoot for something more fun.
