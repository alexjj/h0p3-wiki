title: 2021.08.23 - chameleon: Gibberish of Love

//I [[hope]] you don't mind the livedraft and muh speculative gibberish (ignore any of it at-will). I love you.//

Dear Madame Senpai [[chameleon]],

It is my opinion that you are an excellent wrestler because you don't give up. You often have a fitting openness even to what you hate (you give things multiple tries, similar to tasting foods more than once), and you don't shy away from the hard problems. I admire how much patience you have with me. Further, you can't embarrass yourself with me; I find it valuable to do my best to make it so that I'm always the embarrassing part of any relationship. Super Freaks 4 lyfe.

I hope I don't slip into reply-mode, [[Senpai|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#Senpai]]. Still alive. I am trying to rebuild the habit.
<<<

I [[hope]] you don't too, but it's okay if you do, madame. We all require periods of [[silence]] and we have other fish to fry too. That is something I am still learning (poorly, and like a noob, I might add). Even if I were to never hear or see from you again (and I would be crushed), I would always cherish our [[friendship]] and what I've learned from you. We have a rich story I am glad to reflect upon again and again. Maintaining a relationship with me is ridiculously expensive.<<ref "f">> Even my own blood brothers maintain a limited connection with me (to my eyes). It is still a joy, not just an honor, to listen to their stories. The same with you; we connect when we do, and I'm [[grateful]]. Things [[change]], you've continually had a ton on your plate in the past couple years, and we have time to build our habits together! =). 

As you know, I've stopped generating direct notifications almost entirely at this point; it's similar, I suppose, to taking a half-break from social media. Though I'm slow to respond (and there are times and places where I should not), I still read your wiki like a hawk (up to 5 updates today?). I [[aim]] to refuse to allow anyone else to rightfully claim the title of being your most loyal reader, if I can help it.<<ref "t">> Writing almost anything at all, to whomever,<<ref "c">> and for whatever reasons and feelings seem fitting, matters a helluva lot to me. I realize you won't be able to speak endlessly (though I wish I could hear it). Halting your work in your wiki may be crucial sometimes, and often I think it's like coming up for air. I [[hope]] you can go easy on yourself about it.

<<<
I may try to reframe it with [[Senarai|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#Senarai]]-senpai, whom you may like (if she can handle you). When she's ready to read your wiki, we can have an introduction.
<<<

I think this is a fantastic idea, and not just because I'm super curious (I do want to see it unfold, and in more directions). She seems like a skilled collaborator, and I [[hope]] you continue to find many partners and senpais to work with. Also, I will understand if she'd rather not meet me in the end (most people really, really don't, despite morbid curiosity in some cases). You're correct that I'm a lot to handle. It is my opinion that you know this fact more than most. We rely upon your judgment.

So far, I don't think any introduction generously provided to me has worked yet.<<ref "m">> Part of it is just a skin in the game problem; very few people have had the will and integrity to put their in skin the game with me like you have (and, in many respects, no one has done so as effectively as you have; you've had to publicly wrestle a ton [and that counts for a fuck ton in my book]).
 
I'm still thinking about what it means to meet [[the other]]s of my [[Root Users]]. I'm bad at it (as you obviously know :P). It's exceptionally complicated to my blind eyes; I hope to have earned the right to be passive in most senses simply because I'm otherwise so active in telling my story and listening to others. Similar to enjoying the company of the clubbers, when I'm a fly on the wall, neither speaking nor spoken to, people are not as accountable to me (nor am I required to enforce it); there are many circumstances in which I think this is the best option, especially as I simply don't want to damage the relationships you have (including with me). 

You know me: I'll argue with every person in the room at the same time, [[WINTCIS]].<<ref "y">> These days, when I write a [[Letter]], many of my interlocutors go silent. It may be better that I do not interfere (that makes me pretty useless at parties, I realize :P); and, I'm glad that it is up to your other senpai if they wish to take the risk. My goal is to have a light touch because otherwise I tend to have very heavy hands. Everyone who speaks directly with me is on their own in some respects (and vv).

Let's try three Chame Guarantees

# Chame will always be your friend and a willing ear
# Chame will send you anything she finds interesting or salient
# Chame will not neglect you or forget you
<<<

`/hug`. That's much of the material of [[friendship]] right there, madame. Thank you. Also, you don't even have to send the information directly to me unless you want to. It's okay if you don't have anything to pick out as being [[salient]] for me specifically, and, of course, what you have to say is [[salient]] to me (obviously, that must be finite, there's only so many hours in the day to write - it's such an expensive task sometimes too).

<<<
And three Chame homework problems

# Chame will try to rebuild her habits
# Chame will try to reach out more
# Chame will try to be a better root user

You do what you think is right, and you're doing all I could ask, [[Root User]]. In no small part, I'm thinking about what you think is right to better understand the notion and practice myself. I simply can't solve the problem myself, and you're helping me think about it (and you haven't stopped). There are simply too many places where the only way for me to improve my understanding of what matters is by watching you pick it out in word and deed. Thank you. You've already given me so much. You've been extremely generous to me (and everyone).

Perhaps a human is more a folding, mapping, higher-order function than a collection of adjectives and nouns.
<<<

I recall this. That may be true of not just humans. It seems like this isn't enough either. The hard problem of consciousness seems to elude us. I don't have a satisfactory answer. Part of the computation of our minds may not be explained in physics (that's a wild thing to say, I realize). You may find [[SNilsen]] worth your time (even in what may be profound disagreement with some of his politics, he's onto something valuable [maybe pop into his <<tag [[Discord]]>>server for a bit if you get the chance]). He was recently on a Watts kick, btw.

<<<
What is a self? I think there's some boundary (more like a threshold) where self becomes other and vice-a-versa-vice-a-da-pizza-pie
<<<

God damn, woman, you do ask the hard questions. :P.

Yeah. `/nod`. That's well said. I think that is a very fair claim about at least a part of this crazy hard problem, and perhaps it may be more accurate to go plural, to speak of boundaries and thresholds.<<ref "bo">> I agree to some version of this, and I have no idea how to correctly nail it down into a fixed answer that is satisfactory.<<ref "g">> Of course, this is not the claim there isn't such a particularized answer to our context, nor that the pursuit of such a thing lacks merit. 

Boundaries between parts of our bundled selves as being other to the other parts of ourselves may be significantly different from boundaries between oneself and [[the other]] as what is standardly conceived of as a separate individual, with their own essence,<<ref "es">> history, qualia, self-storytelling, sequences of consciousness, and reliance upon the transduction of meaningful, non-random patterns of activity through multiple mediums to connect to [[other]] minds. There may be something to our intuitions and categories about spacetime boundaries that are motivating here; our [[embodied cognition]]s are connected but still obviously separate to us in a stronger way than [[change]] in each of our minds and bodies.<<ref "ph">> 

Perhaps we should also distinguish mere selfhood from personhood. My cats may have selves, but I wouldn't call them persons. Maybe even rocks or arbitrary configurations of atoms or ideas have selves.<<ref "sl">> I take you to be speaking about selves like our own that we would easily recognize as such. Dasein, as at least the kind of being that experiences thinking about its own existence, is a start (though, I'm not a fan of the lines of reasoning of Orthodox^^tm^^ interpreters of Saint* Heidegger). I take Dasein to be a moral agent, and that is a non-trivial claim (perhaps Dasein is only a layer or a necessary condition for agency), and insofar as that's unacceptable (I readily admit that intentionality is a hard problem), I take us to be most concerned with personhood as agency.

There are too many true facts about any object, including a self (which brings about a host of other boundary problems); the state of affairs is uncountable and contains a true contradiction. Further, the boundaries can be drawn almost arbitrarily. What makes any boundary not an arbitrary one? Which ones matter? Which parts of the self are the most essential and [[salient]]? What ought to stand out in relief? Our job is to draw some lines as best as we can.

I may be [[breaking|2021.07.06 - falling, falling, falling in love]]<<ref "br">> [[a rule|Describing myself as a thinker]] here (including [[my own|@: chameleon]], but we get to do that here, I suppose). As you know, moral agency is a significant worry I have thus far. I know that I'm no fun there (to say the least). From own our vantage points, wisely wielding that is what matters most about who we are.

<<<
To wit, you obviously have your own thoughts and memories that no-one else can access. How much of that self is a social fiction (a social self)? Hermits have no need of names.
<<<

"Social fiction" may be an odd choice of words; there are cases in which that may be true. A human can be radically and thoroughly brainwashed (or we could imagine some kind of brain surgery) to a point that perhaps they never really develop much of an autonomous selfhood (or personhood), and instead are more like instrumental appendages of others that are wantonly wielded as though they were mere objects.<<ref "p">> That would be a failure to respect their dignity, and it would be fair to say they were living a lie. There may be social fictions like that in all of us, but not all of our social selves appear to be so, at least to some [[dok]]. Though, even failed attempts to resist unjustified coercion may count as an exercise of one's social self that isn't a fiction. Going full anti-reductionist spook, for lack of a better absurd phrase: perhaps we [[share]] part of our identity with us, madame. Perhaps we each have parts of it that only we can [[private]]ly access, though I think we can make progress in mutually revealing and uncovering. That we individually must wrestle with [[others]] and make choices about what we're going to do (even about our own conditioning) need not be a fiction.

I'm not claiming you are arguing for or against any of this, but I feel obligated to gesture to other places that might be of interest. I'm far less concerned with authenticity than most (it is not so easy to motivate this beyond autonomy defeaters), and I don't consider causally extending our essence as far as it will materially go to be the goal of having a self like ours (which may be a flaw in approaches to authenticity). I am fairly confident that we cannot have a fully-functioning, flourishing self without [[other]] persons; our social relationships may even be necessarily constitutive of having a non-trivial agential identity at all, perhaps even if only for our species (though I doubt that considerably). How one chooses to interact with [[others]] and why seem to be among the most important facts about ourselves. Of course, I don't have sufficient answers concerning origins of the self or "who" is responsible; there appear to be several [[infinigress]]es at work here.

I do not see why hermits have no need of names (and, I'm nearly a hermit myself). It may be valuable to consider the lives of feral children to see that exercising our genetically accelerated use of language can be necessary to activating and maintaining the rest of our human brains and experiences. Hermits have to talk themselves too, probably both implicitly and explicitly. People who don't have anyone to speak with, to use names with, tend not to thrive (and may even lose their character, minds, or even personhood to some [[dok]]). And, of course, we are left with the question of what it means to be a hermit well, and I am not convinced any hermit can be a good one without the use of names. I am also not altogether sure what consists in a name either; it may be a much broader notion or ontology than I initially believed.<<ref "kh">> This problem only seems to get harder the more I look at it.

Chapmanic [[triad|https://meaningness.com/self-schematic-overview]]: True Self, No-Self, Intermittent Continuity.
<<<

Let me be first to say he's a genius. I'm not going to be nice to him or his words here (and I don't take them to be yours). 

It's an imaginative chart; it's well-constructed rhetoric (realpolitik even). He's extremely legible for such a difficult topic, and he knows his audience well. I think he's talented at telling people what they want to hear too (or at least disagreeing in a palatable manner). I have no doubt that he has quelled many anxieties for people (though I do not claim that is justified). Insofar as he is skilled at finding some deep problems without trying to solve them, it may be fair to say he commits many of the subjectivist crimes of Sir Nietzsche (and, I think he would find that a compliment). Sometimes he makes extremely good moves in some hard places though, and that is not nothing!<<ref "nn">> His work is [[beautiful]], and I agree or at least sympathize with it often (there's more rigor in it than most analytic philosophers would be willing to consider too), but it's not right (and he can always fall back on the claim that he never really intended it to be and that's part of the point). Perhaps he and I face a Daoist kind of problem where we each wrestle from the other direction. I respect that he seeks middleground and is willing to let it dissolve in other cases too. 

His triad and self-help method in general tend to be closer to a [[phenomenological]] description of therapeutic philosophy than an examination of the underlying fundamental problems in metaphysics, morality, and philosophy of mind (though he points to these too, and he's got some non-trivial intuitions to wrestle with). It is my opinion that his program is not designed to flesh out these questions systematically or carefully enough (not even in narrative format), but it does a fine job of causing us to wrestle as existentialists otherwise (sometimes that's a key way to even begin a conversation). There's a lot of epistemic humility in his moves, and I admire the attempt to escape skepticism (in a similar vein to how I admire Sir Nietzsche, Saint* Heidegger, and Saint Wittgenstein). It's almost noble. We each likely possess a razor in our disagreement with each other, and mine with him is that he obviously cannot help himself to normativity while denying it; and, perhaps his should be that I've begged the question. I bet we'd just nod our heads, shrug, and laugh like mystics and not even talk about the matter. Sometimes [[silence]] is the only fitting answer.

Nebulous for whom? The ultimate answer does not rest with me. It's one thing to say I don't know the answer, another to claim it isn't currently accessible to me, another to claim it can only ever be partially or inconsistently accessed (and I do think he's trying to take into account some crazy hard problems), and another to claim there isn't one. I can be open to ambiguity, vagueness, and the classic problems of [metaphysics, language, and mind] without denying the possibility or reality of an absolute, unconditional, totalitizing, clean, or sufficient explanation (and that's where humility is often most tested). I don't see why I should buy his poorly defined (and, nobody can be an expert in everything!) terms of authentic, true, or deep selfhood (highly contentious among trained philosophers),<<ref "ai">> nor do I see why we should buy his molecule, but I am sympathetic. It's extremely difficult to steelman what he's attacking, I realize. 

I admire that he asks us to be less concerned with certainty and to be more accepting of the hard problems. Good! But, overall, it is far from obvious that his program generates wise persons (even if it gets us part of the way there). I consider his work unjustifiably [[dishonest|Instrume]] from the beginning, even with the best reasons I can give for being dishonest in this context. It's brilliant work in that I predict the memeplex he picks out to be one that will continue to grow in [[The Great Human Conversation]]. 

<<<
Alan Watts is [[the one you're speaking to|https://philosopher.life/#Why%20Not%20A%20Wide%20Area%20Network%2C%20Watson%3F]], I presume. He is rather a straightforward outcome of the New Age. We need answers from the East translated into English (because information rots if left untended) but translation is not a straight transformation. Language crystallizes thoughts, and so a little of yourself will be mixed in with the translation.
<<<

I agree that these translations are important and suffer from our [[bias]]. Independent discovery, syncretism, and cultural bridging from some of what I take to be core Eastern thought likely predate Alan Watts considerably.<<ref "pl">> He's got a very pleasant style; and, perhaps one of his greatest skills was saying it simply (I see a ton of exceptions he's handled without even having to mention it). I think we are like him in that we have the benefit of standing on the shoulders of giants. My guess is that he's engaged in comparative religion supercharged by having been widely read, including those who were synthesizing what is called Eastern and Western thought before him, probably with high degrees of access to experts and practitioners with low philosophical Erd≈ës numbers to boot. I will suggest that even before the major explicit translation work we've seen for over a century, Eastern memetics (I have no idea how to draw the lines safely) have been integrating into the rest world for thousands of years. I appreciate that he's an outsider of sorts, he's got that charismatic Feynman elegance, and he's quite practical (I don't mean that as a swearword in this case) sometimes too. If there's a fitting pinball machine to process the bouncing students of philosophy in the world toward a fitting end, he's helped develop a key bumper.

<<<
Watts' great error then was to find one idea (no-self) he really latched onto and used it like kosher salt and MSG to flavor everything he came across. 
<<<

XD. Yeah, that may be fair to say. Unfortunately, that salt wasn't [[salient]] enough. Still worthy to wrestle with, of course!

<<<
He is an old rasslin' partner of mine.
<<<

I like to think you are a well-traveled philosopher who has a knack for picking your partners, turtles, angels, and leviathans too. You wander many places and wrestle some rarified folks with unique stances too.  

<<<
Zen is a depression cure. It's [[The Good]] disguised as nihilism. Sitting quietly will do one a lot of good; the problem is when you read too much into the shit they tell you to get you to sit quietly.
<<<

I am not an expert in Zen, its memetic heritage, or its historiography (though I've wrestled with some who have pieces of paper that claim they are experts [I have my doubts about the entire industry though]). To my limited understanding and experience, it is a depression cure for some. Though, I will point out that not all solutions to depression are justified, nor are the solutions necessarily what ought to be continued after escaping the pit. I admire many qualities of [[Positive Nihilism]]<<ref "ab">> (I suggest [[Positive Disintegration]] requires it at some points), and sometimes these are the exact monkeywrenches, methods, antidotes, thought-poisons, y u m m y drugs, and [[antipleonasm]]s a person needs to make justified progress.<<ref "pn">> No education is complete without having tasted many mysticisms (how would you learn to detect and develop a fitting tolerance to iocaine powder so that one could transform the Water of Life?),<<ref "io">> including what consists in various types of Zen. 

I would be interested to see your analysis after experiencing LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, and ketamine.<<ref "md">> I suggest that many aspects of what is Zen are sometimes packaged in these chemically induced experiences. I know many people make fun of this (many professors thought it absurd), but I think it's worth taking quite seriously. There's a reason these drugs are now being recognized as cutting edge tools in the fight against some types of depression.

I will agree that at some level and for some doorways, whatever is fitting about Zen as a practice is in virtue of picking out or leading to [[The Good]]<<ref "tg">> sometimes disguised or simply as nihilism.<<ref "im">> There is a time and a place for it. Perhaps the best I can do for the claim that anything is "[[The Good]] disguised as nihilism" is to pick out the being of non-being (and its variants) and nod my head just as confused as anyone else; we don't seem to have made any serious progress on that problem in thousands of years. Whatever the true contradiction is, that seems to be a part of it.

<<<
I hope you can find something pearl-ish among the Watts ocean. He was a prolific man if nothing else.
<<<

Even if I think he isn't a good person, I am in debt to Sir Watts. I hope to understand more. I've got 10,000 things to wrestle with, and I'm failing at almost all of them, lol. Welp. Yup. [[Itdo]] be like that sometimes.

I'd like to close by saying that I think you may be the only interlocutor I have who has both put their skin in the game with me and sustains their explicit philosophical pursuit so thoroughly. It is my honor to be your student, madame. As usual, I get the feeling people walking by me are assaulted by the dark energy radiating from this blackhole of a ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî± as I climb out of their screens to haunt them. And, but, of course, I refuse to be friends with people whose standards are so low they talk to a person like myself, XD. My daughter says it is difficult to distinguish between when I am throwing bricks and when I laying them with her. You are exceptionally thoughtful in how you handle me. You make life worth living, [[chameleon]]. Thank you. 

[[Love]],
