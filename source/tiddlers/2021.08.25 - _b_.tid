We call upon Reddit to call upon Reddit to take action against those who call upon Reddit to take action against the rampant Coronavirus misinformation on their website. None of the solutions Reddit will pick will be moral, and anyone who would make that realpolitik call without attempting to wrestle with us about the ideal alternative (warts and all) has already failed just as egregiously (and, disingenuously so to boot); it cannot be done if they are for profit, the centralization of their own [[power]], and the extension of their essence from that simulated collective ego epicenter. I think most humans I encounter are profound sources of misinformation, and there are better ways to deal with moderation without resorting to censorship.

Unshakable trust, unspoken connections across any span, so robustly tended for so long it can be lovingly neglected without harm. Outcomes almost irrelevant for we have already achieved it.

How did that work out for ya? Bless your heart. That suits you. Best of luck to you.

Imagine: being trapped in a world of excruciating [[smalltalk]] that abruptly ends as soon as it approaches the potential for committed [[friendship]], to see the same people everyday for years while growing nothing but bare walls from surface-level niceties. No one actually really naively believes in those archaic notions of genuineness and [[intimacy]], or that such risky practices could be real, meaningful, or even possible. Why, but, of course, everyone knows it's just a signaling game of appearances and mere masks! Why even bother intending to be anything more (pursuing anyone but myself), especially if no one else seems to try? Just sit back and watch the show; it's the best one can do in these sorts of circumstances, as it were. `/smh`. Keep it real, my ninjas.

To what [[dok]] does nihilistic reductionism attempting to grapple with the "objective" meaninglessness of the subjective (before collapsing) incorrectly handle the idea that any given point singled out is to be treated as having some special value over others because some random subjectivity focused their consciousness upon it, especially in generalizing every such instance to be such that objectively any random point would have sufficed as well?

What should I call these object points, these tiddlers, in the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱: node, screen, location, passage, lexia, scene, section, situation, page?
