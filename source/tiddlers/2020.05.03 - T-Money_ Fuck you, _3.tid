Sorry about the computer work. Hopefully, it will die down soon for ya.
May 1 1:41pm
I adore working on computers, but not bullshit training.
May 1 1:41pm
How are your co-workers?
May 1 1:41pm
We're doing well enough over here. Grinding away in school, trying to keep our head above water.
May 1 1:41pm
Is your wife excited to head back to work?
May 1 1:42pm
The job is definitely different than what I am use to. Revenue is gained from how many  people need to be taken to hospitals via helicopter. So low volume right now means few hours on the aircraft. Maintenance is driven by flight hours. We also do all the shipping, receiving, ordering and inventory for the base. So I will learn to wear many hats at once. Doing my best to stay positive and enjoy the increased time at home. But on call all the time... I've done very little helicopter maintenance. Lol. We are suppose to be getting so more work in the hangar soon. I fly to Denver Sunday for a week of training.
May 1 8:19pm
Wife is definitely excited to get back to work. But lots of additional precautions that have to be made so it's weird. Like everything right now.
May 1 8:20pm
I am having some buyers regret with the new job. I eliminated my horrible commute but traded it for a more stressful job. At least for my learning period.
May 1 8:21pm
Always sucks being the new guy. I will be happy when I find my Grove. But I suspect that might take up to a year or more.
May 1 8:23pm

Traveling cross country during a worldwide pandemic. Surreal.
May 3 6:25pm
Just fyi
May 3 6:25pm
I'm exceptionally interested in your thoughts and feelings on the matter.
May 3 6:37pm
It must be a profound experience.
May 3 6:38pm
Still kind of processing it. I flew out of Lexington to Chicago, then to Denver.
May 3 6:39pm
I woukd say 85% of people were wearing some type of mouth covering.
May 3 6:39pm
Oddly enough. Many of the pilots were not wearing masks.
May 3 6:39pm
Lol
May 3 6:39pm

I hope your training is going smoothly.
May 4 1:32pm
Fuck you [[h0p3]].
May 4 8:03pm
Lol
May 4 8:03pm
I'm glad you laughed. That's excatly how I ment it.
May 4 8:04pm
<3
May 4 8:04pm
Lol
May 4 8:04pm
The a/c in my room isn't working.
May 4 8:04pm
Ugh.
May 4 8:05pm
I'm so spread out I don't wanna move my stuff.
May 4 8:05pm
Not cool, man.
May 4 8:05pm
Sorry
May 4 8:05pm
It's funny. Not sad.
May 4 8:05pm
I got some alcohol for tonight. Gonna try to do some work training and drink.
May 4 8:06pm
Only way to do it.
May 4 8:06pm
Gotta video chat with wife and kiddo soon.
May 4 8:06pm
Noice.
May 4 8:06pm
Trying not to message old women in my life. It's a habit/ struggle that often resurfaces when I am alone.
May 4 8:07pm
My wife does not praise me very often. Lots of expectation and pressure.
May 4 8:07pm
Sometimes it's nice to hear I'm deserable as is. (parental abandonment and daddy issues).... Haha
May 4 8:08pm
I hear ya.
May 4 8:09pm
Hopefully, that will become easier.
May 4 8:09pm
How's Denver?
May 4 8:09pm
Met a cool guy from Ohio at the liquor store. And got some BBQ. I haven't went anywhere else. Hopefully tomorrow I go drive toward the mountains.
May 4 8:10pm
Excellent.
May 4 8:14pm
Just a week?
May 4 8:14pm
Yeah.
May 4 8:39pm
Got. My ac fixed. Girl t desk had to turn a valve... I dunno. I looked....
May 4 8:39pm
It is funny. This training schedule is 20 aircraft mechanics.
May 4 10:18pm
It is usually split with medics, pilots, and mechanics.
May 4 10:18pm
You can read the room for sure. Like. We make sure this shit work so everybody get paid. Own up. Lol. If we fail people die or we can't fly (lost revenue)
May 4 10:19pm
There is a bar and restraunt in hotel. If it wasn't for covid 19. Half of us would be down there half drunk watching sports I. The lounge.  =normal mecahinca together....
May 4 10:20pm
Sorry. I've been drinking.
May 4 10:21pm
Lol. Not a problem.
May 4 10:21pm
Did you have to travel for your previous job?
May 4 10:22pm
Yeah. All of them. For different training schools.
May 4 10:23pm
Hell I went to Oklahoma city for FAA training and was in the bar less than an hour after class drinking with my instructors. Lol
May 4 10:24pm
We got free drink tickets.
May 4 10:24pm
If you didn't know. Oklahoma city is FAA headquarters
May 4 10:24pm
Ah, that makes sense.
May 4 10:24pm
Nifty.

May 4 10:25pm
Might have already sent you this one.
May 4 10:25pm
Nope
May 4 10:25pm
Gorgeous. I love the mountains.
May 4 10:26pm
Planning to ride out there Wednesday. That's the view from the parking lot of my hotel.

Chicago - part of it.
May 4 10:27pm
Hard to have fun during CV19, but it seems like you are finding good ways.
May 4 10:30pm
Making the best of a bad situation.
May 4 10:30pm
High exposure at Chicago Airport and then Denver. I don't like it. Being in a big city where 80% are wearing masks. But I'm not.
May 4 10:31pm
I'm also in Kentucky working and touching aircraft that have carried positive covid 19 patients.... It's. Redundant.
May 4 10:31pm
Pretty heavy mask-wearing here in CT as well, particularly near any commercial entity.
May 4 10:31pm
I would not be surprised if you've got the antibodies.
May 4 10:32pm
Or just lucky. 🤷🏽‍♂️
