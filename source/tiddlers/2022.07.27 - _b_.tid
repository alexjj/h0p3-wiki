The bourgeois imperative to "tell one's story" is often a thinly-veiled prescription to enable an ersatz crony-consensus validation theater of narrative props and prosthetic memories through which to rationalize the narcissistic-attention seeking of those who "confess" their apparent trauma and wounded attachments in order to qualify as a victim in their own eyes and in front of culturally similar misery porn consumers of [[The Spectacle]]. The demands of [[Justice]] far exceed human rights discourse and attitudes of concern for trauma stories. Feeling compassion is not the same as acting right. Insofar as we tell our stories to merely construct legitimating rationales, we can hardly claim to be honestly pursuing the truth, let alone what matters.

There's some truth to accusations of "victim culture" in the US when you can't go to a job interview without preparing to answer "tell me about a time you overcame adversity". We are often encouraged to performatively develop and deliver successful images within therapy-grade-unpacking elevator speeches about our victimization and to show our ability to cope with a traumatic event or a disability by turning it into a marketable skill. This flood of summarized appearances of developing our own human capital desensitizes observers while deprioritizing, flattening, and drowning out the cries of real victims and those most in need. The most victimized become alienated from either their possible right to reserve having to [[share]] deeply painful revelations or otherwise from themselves when forced to codeswitch into [[smalltalk]] surface-level lies. Likewise, we're encouraged to tell our traumatic stories in post-secondary education admissions essays and personal statements not only in an increasingly competitive attempt to "jump off the page" but also as a way to explain away any poor grades or other possible redflags. These processes disadvantage those who do not safely traverse the long minefield list of hidden rules and strategies for selecting and presenting the "proper" tragedy or adversity, as they are instead immediately dismissed for honestly speaking of their lives that don't tick exactly the "right" arbitrary boxes. Vulnerability signaling becomes a good only in a specific way that reinforces how you no longer need it, since those who either face current problems that aren't in the distant past that would never happen again or lack a neat little socially acceptable trauma because they can't package an extremely traumatic situation in palatable terms for their assessors, often exploiters and supporting reactionaries, are only further disadvantaged. Poorly executed victim cultures (even including pomopost[[pleft]]istpurityspirals) victimize many of those already most victimized.

Do tourists pay for the privilege of traveling primarily so they can tell themselves and [[others]] merely the stories they want to tell about who they are? Many want to feel like they've connected with the exotic orient, survived the wild west, been scarred by realâ„¢ danger, touched treasure, and transformed into a mysterious person. They want to tell themselves and others the stories of becoming and being one who has been there and done that, as though their lives actually mean something even extra in the grand scheme of things according to the standards of shallow consumers. Their protaganist-syndrome-driven consumption provides just enough evidence for them to feel authentic while merely virtue signaling. If so, tourism is often a colonial endeavor practiced for and about the tourist's ego rather than [[reconstructing]] their place in //The World// to serve [[others]] [[irwartfrr]]. Their self-described inner stories are fictions meant to blind themselves to the horrors of what they are actually doing with their lives. The intention behind that idealized-self mask selection is real, no doubt, but the objective meaning of it is not what the author is directly telling themselves or others.

Yet, despite the contempt we should have for convenient fictions and flatteringly overselective truth-telling: discovering the truth through [[reconstructive|Reconstruction]] storytelling is our plight as moral agents. There are justified approaches to telling one's stories and assimilating the stories of [[others]], the possibility of [[just|Justice]] governance and amelioration is real, and there is emanicipatory potential in some waves of testimony interpreted within [[good]] [[faith]] [[wrestling]] arenas. How else can we [[Find The Other]]? So, why do you tell your stories the way you do, and what do you do with them?
