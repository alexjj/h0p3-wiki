title: 2020.08.09 - Prompted Introspection: Beer

!! What's one of the greatest inventions?

[[2017.06.13 - Prompted Introspection Log]] picks out what is lacking just fine, and I'm going to be too lazy to give a shit about fixing the problem.<<ref "l">> I like this modified question. Who doesn't look at the ancient Chinese, Archimedes, Gauss, the corvids, the survivalists through history, the tinkerers, all the crazy creatures building insane shit (especially when they didn't know what it would even be good for) and think: I wish I was that fucking cool?

Beer is among my favorite inventions.<<ref "s">> It appears to have been a cornerstone civilizing force. [[Jesse knows|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEvQOPUHGH8]]. I'm grateful for all the beer innovators through history. Drinking from the thick mash through a straw of the ancients, or my great grandfathers who heated their beers up by the fire...nope, I'm far too ~~civilized~~ spoiled for that. =).
