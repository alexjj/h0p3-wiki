You use the "we are not the same" meme unironically. I don't. We are not the same.

If you think there's nothing meaningful (let alone prescriptively valuable) about seeking a revolution even if you predict it will fail (and I don't mind some broad notions of revolution here), you might be ~~well-adjusted~~ a reactionary. If you think successful revolution is impossible or not your responsibility, then you are ~~well-adjusted~~ a reactionary.

At least many spectacular events are absorbed by a system recreating itself as if those events never happened, but I do not see why all are such. It may be fair to say [[Debord]]'s phenomenon, namely what he's picking out (rather than his own writing as a political work), is only part of the complete description.

The OT is often about our barbaric origins and the costs of unwisely choosing the targets of our worship. The progressive revelation is the result of a Platonically-charged memeplex mutation of a teleology that escapes the war of all against all.
