title: Film: Exploration

; 2022.12.24 - Pontypool
: Prolly a cult classic low-budget zombie film. As someone who spends a lot time worrying about the nature of media and minds, this one hit. 

; 2022.12.23 - Moonrise Kingdom
: I have no idea what to call this type of [[hope]], but I admire it. It's a worthy experience. Bask in it.

; 2022.12.13 - Drive My Car
: Bourgeois delusion.

; 2022.12.12 - One Night in Miami
: Whitewashed, still has the Rand-Locke egoism memeplex at the core, despite the considerable lipservice it pays otherwise.

; 2022.12.11 - Falling Down
: I suggest this was a prototype or at least a source of inspiration for //Joker//. Somehow, it is a novel experience to be made to empathize with the apparent villain. Beware the cop apology.

; 2022.12.09 - The Worst Person in the World
: You're a shallow person if you like this film. Palpable irony.

; 2022.12.09 - Crumb
: We're lost like unhinged pinballs. I have no problem with the juvenile perspective (:P), but I do have a problem with being too self-indulgent. There's a wrastlin' in here though, no doubt. Hard to be constructive. I think this is one of the reasons I value [[DeathOfRobinhood]] and [[kickscondor]] so much. Insofar as they can be peeled, the key to being a good artist is just being a good person (//After Virtue//'s positivism is wrong); it's what they do outside of their art that does the real work. Making do with what is broken. Crumb is mistaken.

; 2022.12.08 - Kiss the Soil
: Ignore the narrator, the faux spiritualism, the celebrities, and you might enjoy the justified carbon-based lifeforms...naw. It's not consistent, and it feels more like mere virtue signaling. I will say it had potential.

; 2022.12.08 - The Fog of War
: Listen to a narcissist justify evil.

; 2022.12.05 - Hollywoodism: Jews, Movies and the American Dream
: A difficult topic, reasonably handled.

; 2022.12.05 - The Gate of Heavenly Peace - Tiananmen Square Protests
: Seems a fair representation. I feel one with them.

; 2022.12.05 - Africa Addio
: Fucked up. Sad.

; 2022.12.04 - Too Big To Fail
: Unalmost unwatchable drama, poorly constructed, yet still on an important topic. I feel differently about this film years later.

; 2022.12.01 - Three Thousand Years of Longing
: Phrase artists, 80% accurate, the moral failings of Romanticism quite apparent. Gorgeous.

; 2022.12.01 - Uncharted
: Didn't make it beyond 2 minutes.

; 2022.12.01 - The Work
: A religious perhaps even cultic experience.

; 2022.11.30 - American Factory
: Well done! I wish I had been taught this long ago. Would have been nice to see it used to interpret how America has so thoroughly exploited the rest of the world though.

; 2022.11.30 - Empire of Dust
: A moving film that continues to be relevant today. Wish I knew how to sum it up, especially given my experiences in Thailand (I know, I keep saying this...but, it's true) observing what African teachers endured. A must watch.

; 2022.11.28 - What Is a Woman?
: Rhetorically Michael Moore-esque, though with fewer absurdities and gotchas overall. He let them do most of the talking. Most of the questions were fair, though few of Walsh's positive conclusions were sufficiently justified. To my surprise, the film might be 80% correct, but it jumps off the cliff. There's some valid criticism in here, but one must approach the political work itself with caution.

; 2022.11.27 - Powaqqatsi
: Prototypes of //Samsara// are a gift.

; 2022.11.11 - Trump: The Comeback
: Not literally on his back. 

; 2022.10.24 - Traumazone
: Words are hard to define. Someone has lost their touch. May they gain it back and make something more accurate the next time.

; 2022.10.04 - Solo: A Star Wars Story
: Relatively cute background noise.

; 2022.10.02 - Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker
: There are two scenes that made me cry. You know the ones. While I think the story sits in shambles, pure garbage almost across the board, it clearly did a fine job hitting the hard parts well. For that, I salute you: `/salute`.

; 2022.10.01 - Star Wars: The Last Jedi
: Why won't the gilfs fuck? This pile of shit required alcohol to make palatable. I question the moral value of our species.

; 2022.09.28 - Rogue One
: Sunk cost fallacy consumption.

; 2022.07.28 - Yojimbo
: Pretty. Unmotivating.

; 2022.06.13 - Money, Power and Wall Street
: An attempt at fairness. It's PBS after all. Dramatic and long. A reasonable addition to the library. Last piece in the series might be the best.

; 2022.06.12 - China Blue
: Haunting. I am reminded of my time in Thailand. 

; 2022.06.06 - Panic: The Untold Story of the 2008 Financial Crisis
: Sorkin is a grandmaster propagandist. Heaps of salt and critical doubt make it an interesting watch. Disgusting.

; 2022.05.29 - Everything Everywhere All At Once
: Huge fan of Rick & Morty's Jackie Chan's Religious Test, ofc. Too mind over matter for my taste. Let us lose our minds together over what really matters though. Surreal and fun sometimes. Too incoherent, even when it aims to be. Dildo fight scene is one of the best I've ever seen, and for that reason, I forgive my wife for the rest of this nightmare. Vapelyfe. I take it back. Part 2 of the film presents The Divine [[Itself]]. Worth every penny. This movie was [[art]], especially for any fan of [[The Matrix]], It asks us to doubt what is worth doubting so wisely, and beyond that, I do not suggest too much analysis. That place where reason is no longer reasonable, where what is unreasonable is the best reason one could possibly imagine: it's got it, in spades. I am reminded of Sir [[kickscondor]] and Sir [[DeathOfRobinhood]], once again. `/salute`. Without a doubt, it is among the best movies I have ever watched in my life. It'll make you laugh through tears of all kinds. If there were a post-irony (and, it is okay to zone out; you will), this is what it seeks. It means everything.

; 2022.05.11 - The Commanding Heights: The Battle for the World Economy
: Offspring and I began our disagreement off the bat with this storytelling.

; 2022.05.06 - Capitalism: A Love Story
: Moore doing his thing. Fine propaganda.

; 2022.04.28 - Margin Call
: Ambiguous, poor writing, and designed to get you to empathize with psychopaths.

; 2022.04.17 - The Flaw
: Clear and concise. This should be in school curriculum.

; 2022.04.11 - Death on the Nile
: It's not clear to me that we should entrust my wife to blindly pick out films for [[Family Time]]. XD. This one sucked. Glad we watched though. I didn't fall asleep, but I wanted to. Guessed it within the first 15 minutes. If I can do that, anyone can.

; 2022.04.03 - Don't Look Up
: Ignore the hypocrisy and smarm. It's sufficiently right and political at the same time, a rare combo. 

; 2022.03.23 - Jackass Forever
: Forced. They say history repeats itself eventually as farce, and maybe two farces makes a nostalgia? Animals were hurt in the production of this film. Keep your FF button at the ready, and turn your empathy on. Passing the fake and gay^^tm^^ (seems difficult to argue that the fat, old, wrinkly male human form is appealing outside of humor) dynamite baton of retardations. These people want money, and they will do almost anything to get it. Given their trust issues, masks for covid were a nice touch. This is the end times. The absurdity may be overproduced, but I have been entertained by what little remains of our humanity. Like this show, maybe we all should die. Thank fucking god that Eric Andre came to save us all.

; 2022.03.16 - The Corporation
: Great work. Would like to see this as part of school curriculum.

; 2022.03.14 - Videodrome
: p0rn and moar. Schizo. [[The Spectacle]]: it's alive. Vagina grows in his chest. I'd do it. Huge waste of time. 

; 2022.03.09 - Wax or the Discovery of Television Among the Bees 
: I'm probably too dumb to understand this. A spiritual work.

; 2022.03.09 - Koyaanisqatsi
: A rare kind of frissonic atonement "wordless" orchestral video film. It's gorgeous, especially for when it was made. Like a precursor to the //Samsara// series, I'm bettin'. Stellar [[art]]. Thank you.

; 2022.03.07 - Enron: The Smartest Guys In The Room
: The title does it [[justice]]. I'm [[grateful]] it exists. May it bind us together.

; 2022.01.30 - The Greatest Showman
: I [[love]] my family enough to endure what I hate.

; 2022.01.23 - The Money Masters
: I'm delighted to see a more historical account of usury. It never gets enough attention.

; 2022.01.23 - The China Hustle
: Not a decent soul telling the story. Some Red Scare, and clearly, a failure to examine capitalism (despite lip service). Better than nothing though.

; 2022.01.21 - The Wall Street Code
: `/nod`. As a young teenager, I thought this could be where I was going, assuming I could be moral in the pursuit. `/sigh`.

; 2022.01.10 - Encanto
: Per [[Shah]] and mi amor's desires, I watched most of it before I fell asleep. `/shrug`. A same old new message for GenA. Graphics were dope.

; 2022.01.01 - Source Code
: Part of [[Waldo_After_Dark]]'s collection. Didn't pass the 5-minute Test. Pretty horrific.

; 2022.01.01 - Tenet
: There are so many flaws (deeply incoherent) in the first 4 minutes, that we couldn't get through it. Failed the checkpoint. I do enjoy the [[music]] though.

; 2021.12.23 - The Matrix Resurrections
: Forced, incoherent, unfaithful, unfunny, entirely too self-aware moneygrab. Those familiar with it should be disappointed, and those unfamiliar confused. Gen-Z targeted in language, cultural moves, and plot structure. Shitty neolib lip-service to feminism? I adore that [[Sir Baudrillard|Simulacra and Simulation]] hated the previous Matrix movies, and this was yet another solid representation of his bullshit (with nods to Saint Hegel). Bad psychology devoid of serious philosophical inquiry in this case. I'm honored to have watched it, and I have no idea how I would have rebooted the series. Still, may it wake another generation.

; 2021.12.14 - Cashback
: Shitty timestop porn.

; 2021.11.20 - Old Henry
: Even I predicted what was going to occur in the first 5 minutes, and I'm retarded. It was still somehow compelling enough to make me say: I'm glad I watched it (and not just because I got to watch with mi amor).

; 2021.11.06 - The Crow
: Goth. Incoherent. Dramatic. I do not understand.

; 2021.10.21 - [[Dune]] (2021, obv)
: The vision and the music are baroque, and even the austere parts were majesty simplified into elegance. I have a thousand things to say, and I don't think I'm going to say them. lol. I don't know why. I'm glad though. The religious imagery and language were moving (the girls firing off their feelers into all the coincidences, my daughter seeing several things before we did, we all read into it too [as we do]). This was an opera. I will say this, and it is high praise: [[It]] [[is|Dune]] a [[good]] [[faith]] representation. Their interpretation did it [[justice]]. They captured 80%, fabricated 10%, and the jury's out on the rest. It is probably the best thing I've seen all year, and I'm afraid that [[The Matrix]] movie will never, ever live up to this. There are many details that are off (and even missing scenes, injections of all kinds of new material), and it was my honor to watch it on the big screen. It was a rare opportunity. 

; 2021.06.07 - Anomalisa
: I enjoyed this perverted animation of a simulation. Only creepy, masked puppets could ride the uncanny valley like that. Michael (a blah name for a blah broken character) only intermittently sees through privileged postmodern cracks of insanity, awkwardness, and apparent sameness. Is this a downbeat narcissism wrapped in reassuring slice of life escape?  His existence is a trapped exercise between bored politeness and unique fucks in search of what is an unexplainable bridge without any genuine soul-searching beyond his psychosis. He has a habit of unreflectively conflating fleeting limerence with disciplined [[love]], though I admire the delicacy that might heal the lunacy. Eventually the overriding sameness darkens his life again, like the spark has been snuffed out. I agree with his rant. =). I like how we get a forced taste of Michael's [[phenomenology]] of mundane robotic NPCs. He capriciously has no idea what to look for because he's a person without purpose beyond himself, and he circles back yet again to being the same in the end because of it too. He can't escape himself because he's only looking for himself in [[the other]]. If people are mere mirrors and objects to fulfill his desires, then he will eventually grow bored of any individuals (including himself), seeing them as flawed and lifeless as the sextoy (and his hollowness too). In a sense, he [[Greyrock|FTO Mode: Greyrock]]s himself. He doesn't really believe there's anything [[good]] in the world besides the immediate sensation of present, self-absorbed euphoria. He can't empathize with anyone, not even his own [[4DID]]. The film doesn't make the mistake of attempting to flatten all flaws. 

; 2021.04.25 - Promising Young Woman
: I would drink that coffee. Catharsis. Vindication. You go girl. This was a happy movie.

; 2021.03.15 - Wizards
: What an odd animation! It's different, extremely incoherent, gorgeous, and it actually had enough nipples! Elinore is hawt AF, you have no idea (reminds me of two people considerably, El-based names be based). Peace, in the hope he brings it. The renaming. Hrm. Well, it is definitely a moving picture.

; 2021.02.21 - Harold and Maude
: Everything you give me. A crucial channel I'm lucky to have, and, oh boy, do I want to respond immediately (impatient and impulsive sumbitch I yam).<<footnote "i" "I can barely stop myself from spilling it here.">> Poor Sublime Text Pile: it just sits there in tension, pitiful (wah) :P. It's the wrong medium though. Audacity's recording won't do either. These just aren't spontaneous enough. Oh my. Immmmmmolation. Their relationship is stunning, and the characters shine through clearly.<<footnote "f" "For the record, I find it appealing on multiple levels. I have no hang-ups in this domain (I barely have any lines).">> It's so magnificent it hurts. I yearn for lived experience with you.<<footnote "h" "And, holy fuck, remoting is so hard. It's harder than I imagined.">> Oh, I know, love. You are going to have to look me in the eyes. Yes, I do want to talk about this one. Would you like to watch it again (or another if you prefer), with me? Sometimes I [[pause]] often (though I will let it pass and say nothing if you ask it of me). To be clear, my satisfaction requires hearing you eat a //giant// bag of popcorn (guilt-free* - you were forced to do it, ofc!) with //nothing// but a warm, fuzzy blanket while watching this (preferably in my lap, but I can't have everything). I will {[[Dream]]}. 

; 2020.11.21 - Becoming Nobody
: Thoughtful master storyteller with nostalgic disciple as a mouthpiece, mind-over-matter, high-AF, seeking [[Beauty]] and stoicism, treating others as mere phenomena happening, choosing additional freedom over righteousness (except it's wrong to be addicted to freedom, as he points out), we are so much more than who we are, unclinging our minds from causes of suffering, theory of mind as strictly in the brain (no computation outside it, even in the rest of the body) excepting a being from his imagination, feeding people freedom prescription, serving people as means to enlightenment, standard strawman of normativity (DDarko Fear language), actions as evil but not beings, 

; 2020.11.21 - TFW NO GF
: Bravo. Humanizing. It covers the narrowest slice (for better or worse), but I feel it captures the dystopic spirit well enough (warts and all). In a way, they avoid attempting to marshal some of the standard incel arguments, but not in an uncharitable fashion (good job!). It's a real critique of society, and they represented my people and their perspectives with an acceptable degree of empathy. All that said: it's more hopeful than I am, particularly when I apply this lens at a global scale.

; 2020.11.03 - The Social Dilemma
: What dilemma again? Dramatic, but it should be. It's an attempt at accuracy but not honesty (though it says many true and relevant things). Sociopathic ex-employees who don't want to take responsibility for how they've spent their lives (it's not like they were working just to feed themselves). //Mea Culpa// (but not really) warning my ass. This is not remorse, repentance, abdication, or the kind of self-reflection that admits they aren't wise enough to guide us (or some radical rethink of their lives), but it's heavy on rationalization, half-measures, and revision (except maybe Raskin, Cathy, & Prophet Lanier [who is perhaps not careful enough with his words either]). They've not taken into account the pressures youth are facing in the past decade either. It's overstated the power of social media and understated the centralization of computation (the means of production) and wealth. Capitalists and reactionaries (including the maliciously ignorant and apathetic) treating others as mere means is the fundamental problem (I can trace every problem in this movie back to it). I like how they slip polarization in there too. Nobody is even owning up to the truth that we don't have democracies in the world! There may even be an argument in here that influence should cost money and seek centrism (several moves suggesting we further empower platforms for censorship). There's no attempt to even talk about the possibility of radically decentralized social media in here (though they are optimistic that they can still make money morally here). Come out and say it, bitches. This film is ludditic misdirection and hand-wringing, pointing to regulation prescriptions and claiming it was policy that made me do it. Neolib motte and bailey. Fuck most of these people: I hope their throats get slit (I suppose I have many kisses to blow). Maybe my goal should be teach the poor how to actually end the lives of the wealthy without getting caught; aim for precision rather than chaos (though I suggest other means first). 

; 2020.11.02 - Trump Card 2020
: I have no idea where to begin. It's painful to empathize with most humans, and this was no exception

; 2020.10.25 - The Public
: I'm not saying I trust why this exists or who made it. I'm not saying it's well-made either. Plenty of incoherence. Still cried. Worthy watch.

; 2020.10.23 - Borat Subsequent Movefilm
: I did lose it once. I should have been drunk for the film though. Does not seem rewatchable. Trying to recapture what probably won't be.

; 2020.10.17 - Reality Bites
: It was everything I hoped it would be. My wife shines through so clearly in this one. 

; 2020.09.18 - Feels Good Man
: Standard rhetoric of a documentary. Fairly accurate, though I'm not convinced it's fittingly empathic. I will defend channers, incels, neets, etc. where others will not. There was no [[pleft]]ist analysis, and that's exactly why they could not speak with authority on alienation and obligation.

; 2020.09.03 - Prisoners
: Ugh. Dark AF.

; 2020.09.03 - Sicario
: I don't get it. I would have enjoyed it more a decade ago though. Gotta try though.

; 2020.07.29 - Hamilton
: Might be worth a second watch. That's pretty damn good for a musical.

; 2020.07.25 - Psych 2: Lassie Come Home
: Perfectly what you expect it would be. I am glad I was high and in my wife's lap.

; 2020.07.16 - Jojo Rabbit
: Optimism I will keep with me in my pocket. Random wikipedia pickup, and then recommended by my brother. I'm glad I took another shot at it.

; 2020.07.03 - Jay and Silent Bob Reboot
: Couldn't finish it. It was sad. =(. 

; 2020.06.23 - [[Midsommar]]
: I am likely unqualified to hold an opinion. [[Sphygmus]]' video recommendations should not be taken lightly. She knows how how to pick'em.

; 2020.06.18 - [[Hereditary]]
: The end will stay with me forever. The music alone owns me.

; 2020.04.18 - Knives Out
: Family enjoyed it. Kinda lame in some respects, but I'm glad we got to watch it together. Not many movies that click well enough for all of us.

; 2020.04.06 - [[Captain Fantastic]]
: [[JRE]] strikes again. It's astounding, and it's probably going to the best movie I'll see in a long time (nothing below this entry comes even close). It took us over three hours + dinner to watch it; we had to pause and talk often. Everyone had extremely strong feelings about it. I wept many times and had to control my breathing. I have plenty of problems with the plot and logic of the world, but that's not what struck me about it. I identify with the main character strongly.

; 2020.01.22 - Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs
: This isn't my first time encountering this. I just forgot all about it. Optimistic.

; 2019.11.29 - Spider-Man: Far From Home
: I love my family. didja knodat? God damn: I love you crazy bastards. You are my favorite humans in the world. This cost my brain as much as a night of binge drinking: my brain is melted. My penis is soft. Pure endurance test. I have limited my trolol commentary about this craftsmanship (recall that capitalism is an efficient allocation of resources toward...some end). I am feeling much better about everything now. I cried //in// the last Spiderman movie (strictly amazing), and I almost cried //through// this one too (strictly something).

; 2019.11.13 - Joker
: Yup. As predicted, that was [[hope]]ful, redeeming, and inspiring. Sadly, this movie is in my comfort zone: it helped me fall asleep last night, lol. A solid cracks and gaping holes movie for me to fall in: the asylum the sanest place in the movie. But for the grace. Joker is a role one can never seriously overact. His character and storyline continue to be remade over the decades, and, continuity questions aside, this was a faithful retelling. It's so well-done in several veins. I see villains everywhere in this no-winner. As usual, I doubt the message and its money-washed motivation, but I'm glad I watched it. I do my best to reason with people. I need to tune my dancing, fingerpainting, and clownscreamcrylaugh. Not all madness is wrong, nor all violence. 

; 2019.10.25 - Parasite
: Fascinating encounters. Old Boy. Hustle. Blackbox. Shushed and shamed. Word of mouth. Need a word for weeb about America. Ocean's 11 meets that one movie with mole people, but forced. Not as touching as I was predicting.

; 2019.07.15 - Dark Money
: Fantastic. I needed a beer. I learned something about Montana. I might not have learned much about the general problem that I didn't know already, but this was a tangible story. 10/10, should be required watching.

; 2019.07.13 - Johnny English
: We lasted 25 inebriated minutes. More heavily commodified Mr. Bean isn't so good. There's no actual cringe.

; 2019.07.13 - Kingsman: The Secret Service
: We lasted 10 whole minutes. I am impressed with our fortitude. There was not a minute of meaning for us.

; 2019.07.09 - Big Tits Zombie
: Poyfektly retarded. Tits and camp.

; 2019.07.08 - The Darjeeling Limited
: I'm not much of an actor groupie-fanboi (unless they are pornstars or very talented at vidya games), but I'm excited by these actors. The spiritual, borderline telepathic, paranoic trust, hypersensitive: "we haven't located us, yet" is gorgeous. The holding it in for a while, barely catching trains, constant drug use, searching for important people in our lives, tres hermanos, deadpan affect, pacts and planning, constant flippant irony into hyperreal sincerity, Anderson cuts, concepts of using people, the hyper religious-appearing mother, etc. are a lot to take in. OMG, MACE, MY BROTHER HAS TO SEE THIS. What's wrong with you?! I guess you've still got some more healing to do. Of course, the fucking ineffable. Shut your visionholes. I also see a bunch of rich kids who think they've really found meaning.

; 2019.07.07 - Cloud Atlas
: I started this one a long time ago. I am not blown away, but I'm fine with it. The slavery section of the story was the most interesting by far. I don't understand how this might be a cult classic for some folks.

; 2019.07.07 - Spring Breakers
: Tits everywhere to open. Thank the maker. I've decided I understand why I have it, and I can't make it 20 minutes into the movie. Bye.

; 2019.07.05 - Pandorum
: I don't remember how this ended up in /mnt/fresh, but I'm sure I downloaded it for a reason. I can tell I'm completely out of the loop; I don't know almost any films in the past decade or so. This movie was absolute garbage.

; 2019.07.05 - Dear Zachary A Letter
: My brother, [[JRE]], recommends this one to me. Quite an emotional film; it reminds me of television specials I've seen growing up. The end reminds me of a House M.D. moment with the cancer patients. I can see that my brother aims to be useful to the kids who have no one; it is a high calling.

; 2019.06.02 - Ready Player One
: A wonderful children's movie. I can't say I agree with it all the way down, but it's a starting place. I think I would have puked if they added one more reference or nerd virtue signal.

; 2019.05.31 - Attack the Block
: Absolutely retarded. It was better than Supertroopers 2 though. I did not attempt to kill myself during this film. I should learn to put bad movies down.

; 2019.05.31 - Versus
: I see [[The Matrix]] combat and cinematography in here. The plot was pointless. The zombies, guns, swords, damsel, and cliffhanger were so bad it was almost good. I needed to be high or far more sleep-deprived to enjoy watching this.

; 2019.05.31 - Hard to Be a God
: This is the oddest, longest, grossest film I've seen in a long time. It's hard to gross me out, but this one bombards you with it. The premise only kind of makes sense. It's visceral, and I'm sure it breaks a thousand rules for making film. I was perplexed. I still don't know what the hell I just watched. I think this film is above my paygrade or something.

; 2019.05.29 - Equilibrium
: Gorgeous and wildly incoherent. It attempted to force a point, give us Matrix style gun kata combat, and I cannot recommend the film. Still, it was super pretty and dystopic.

; 2019.05.28 - The Zero Theorem
: What a wacky fucking film (an aesthetic I enjoy though), an awful message, and I am that man. GG. I may have to watch it again. 

; 2019.05.26 - Exotica
: Nothing was surprising about the plot, but it was still a surprising film. Coincidental that "imagination run wild" was my assessment of the previous film, and that is a key  (and explicit) move in this film. It was uneasing, and I enjoyed it. Plus, titties.

; 2019.05.26 - Akira
: An incoherent film, but trippy (worth seeing just for the visuals). It's a bunch of things mixed together, and it's ugly beautiful. Feels like someone let their imagination run wild, which I adore. The narrative is absurd though.

; 2019.05.01 - Supertroopers 2
: Atrocious, a money grab, and a waste of my time.

; 2019.04.01 - Sweeney Todd
: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. Musicals always have +2 point floors and -2 ceilings with me. I adore that it's about shaving, a practice I find absurd. Hey, I can't deny it: hairless is hot sometimes. Rickman is my homie.

; 2019.03.28 - Naqoyqatsi
: We played with the title until it became Anarcho-Nazi (my son picks them out well). Haunting and beautiful until you get bored. The graphics aged poorly, the wordless story wasn't strong enough. I have no idea why this was sitting in Fresh, but we watched for funsies^^tm^^.
