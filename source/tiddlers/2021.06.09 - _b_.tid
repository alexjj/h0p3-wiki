Looking for a vehicle, for reasons must be '02 model or older please, any size dual front airbags, interior doesn't need to be spotless (and if it has cigarette burns, I'll pay extra), suitable rear cargo, stickshift is fine, any mileage acceptable, accidents happen, excellent handling, a great cost-to-performance ratio, and must prefer small fuel nozzles. Think you can help me? Aside, I recently totaled my small remote control car (had to throw it in the dumpster), and I miss it, and I've been following you on Facebook since you got yours, and I was hoping you'd sell it to me. It's so beautiful and I've already got a nickname picked out and I've bought things for it and everything. As I would a purse, I'll carry it around like an accessory. Let me know when I can come pick it up, and please venmo me to pay for my gas.

The Libertarian wants you to stop eliminating their political rights to benefit from eliminating others' political rights (and ignoring others' moral rights). Moral rights are the only categorical sort. Note, however, that being upset with someone's liberation in some cases neither implies we benefit from their oppression nor that said liberation was categorically right or generally good. The Incompatibilist Rawlsian has the only shot of answering the cosmopolitan problem of unifying normativity from outside materialism (and, once again: empiricism hardly requires agreeing to anything like eliminative materialism either).

Writing like I speak does not seem to improve my legibility. Can't talk write neither.

Futures markets on predicting political outcomes will still be subject to corruption. Marketing another market to solve the problem of the market doesn't make progress toward resolving the principal-agent problem. Plz work directly toward fixing global material inequality and liquid representation, reactionaries.

Is accusing X of colonialism a form of colonialism? Wish I knew a moral realist who'd define the term.

The wealthy have privileged access to financial and political vehicles that shield their wealth from inflation, and workers do not. Further, given the diminishing utility returns of money, losing buying power costs the worker more, and surely they don't predict their own wages will even be adjusted for the cost of living (let alone having received a living wage in the first place [let alone have fitting safety nets and owning the means of production]). Relatedly, I agree that monetary policy negotiating power non-trivially depends on how close you are to full employment, but that's precisely why those propagandistic doctored numbers do not reflect reality.
