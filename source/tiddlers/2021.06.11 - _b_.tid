Most human cultures have different groups of people who assert justified belief about metaphysics (philosophy^^tm^^, divination, magic, some axioms and inferences of various religions, meditation, psychedelic trances, etc.). At the very least, I am forced to admit that creatively injecting [[/b/]]ish pseudorandom elements in human discourse and decision-making might sometimes enable us to overcome some [[bias]]es we are otherwise liable to fall prey to.

Building predictive models from your [[private]] histories of messaging, browsing, location, transactions, and connection metadata is far more hazardous to your eudaimonia than having standard identity tokens and keys revealed online (non-trivial dangers, obviously). Obviously we should work to protect both, and they are profoundly connected to each other. It's fair to say we can effectively fight these problems as unorganized individuals only so far (what we have aint shabby), and we can only reduce some of the attack surfaces without eliminating our ability to deeply become good persons with each other (too often it only takes one mistake). Raw representation's vulnerability of being read like a book may have to become common place in some [[dok]]; handing the advantages over to capitalists alone may prevent alternatives from arising. To make it asymmetrically disadvantageous to the capitalist, you must decentralize, anonymize, and mask communications against them while building open communities within those shelters that can still be quite public commons. Alongside the standard reasons we can't trust our hardware and software, even the ML surviving the hype poses many threats to our political autonomy in standard warfare against the proletariat. Are ML equivalents of nukes possible (and, I really don't know what it means for there to be coldwar over this)? It doesn't appear cost-effective to model the human mind (though something on the order of the ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî± provides an advantage), but we can't say it's impossible. Face recognition might reliably store your face in roughly a dozen parameters; compressing a model of one's brain might take billions, but a minimally useful MLed approximation might only be in the millions. Can that be generated en masse? Even targeting could be extremely effective. I suggest the proletariat must win before such an event if they are to succeed at all, but I have no timetable for that (and I'm not convinced anyone does). We must treat the mediators of our digital lives as objects, pipelines, and means, and it can only be done morally qua second-personal P2P respect (lest we do use and encourage the use of others as mere means). Spend your secret agency (`/wink`) on that one, G.

Just remember kids: in any cases where you didn't succeed, you just didn't want it bad enough. Just, like, cut negative people out of your life (as far as is convenient), learn to use your magical mind powers of optimism, and then make sure to continually distance yourself from anyone who points out flaws in society and your relation to it. Why, but, of course, live long and prosper by [[stoic]]ly managing what you claim is up to you under entailment.

Why should I think a revolution can address corruption either in a financial system xor a legal system, strictly in virtue of leveraging one to pressure the other? What if they aren't really terribly distinct parts of the same hyperobject? Virtualizing the process might be our only way out.

Hao 2 [[Cult]]ure [[War|Memetic Warfare]]: validate yourself with locally-defined jargon or conventions, speak down to outsiders, belittle them and knee-jerk discount their mental states, call them paranoid and bully them when they don't agree with you, and above all: do not listen to them as far as you can, but instead quietly lie to yourself at the necessary moments to remain largely unaware of and unreflective about strawmanning them through fundamental misattribution without completely undermining your ability to accurately model them for the sake of aggression.

There is a chance that when you read my words, you unconsciously give me a voice of your choosing, perhaps sometimes a voice that you want to hear, and maybe even a representation of me puppeted by you at some level. Here's what I hope you hear me say: I love you, you objectively matter, it's not [[hope]]less, I respect where you've fought hard for what matters, keep doing best to treat everyone as you would yourself in virtue of something greater than all of us.
