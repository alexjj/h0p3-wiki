; 1844-1900: Friedrich Nietzsche

* There is no God and we do not have immortal souls.
* We are driven by our wills in this meaningless world full of suffering
* This world is all there is - we should embrace it.
* Our current ethics is based on old societies and religions; we should find new foundations for ethics.
* Our success as a species was due to the elimination of the weak (stupid, etc) by the strong (clever, etc)
* Moralists like Jesus created slave moralities - mediocracies protecting the weak and oppressing the gifted.
* The gifted should be able to actualize their creative potential ('will to power') us every domain (politics, arts, etc)
* The will to power is the true happiness for superior people, which is also in the interest of mankind.
* We should embrace a new ethics of life-assertion; "good" and "true" are things that are on the side of life.
* We should not fear conflict with other; it makes us develop our abilities
* A life lived to the full doesn't need to derive its meaning from outside itself.
* Institutional religion is primarily reactive: it does not allow active forces to go to the limit but separates them from what they can do.
* Everything that has happened will happen again in cosmic epicycles of time; this can give motivation for life.
