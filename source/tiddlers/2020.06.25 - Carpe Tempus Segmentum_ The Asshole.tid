title: 2020.06.25 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: The Asshole

* Woke at noon
** Dreams seemed positive. Felt happier waking up than usual.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Walk+Talk
* Afternoon walk with wife
** The stories of our lives. 
** Hammered out our schedule.
** Odd to see blatant (and easily verified) lying from a co-worker. That woman is not stable in a bad way.
** I forgot my beads. Felt the difference.
* Read+Write
* Dialecture
* Shopping
** W-Entity first. 
*** Underwear and bras for everyone applicable. 
*** My wife was unhappy that I took such a heavy-handed approach to picking out clothes with my son. He didn't seem to mind, and it agreed that saving money was crucial. He's set now. Could go a couple weeks without laundry. That's the goal, some cheap wiggle room. One set of dressy-casual for him too.
**** My son has precious little practice shopping. We've not had much money to shop with. Lots of thinking through it with him. I hope that it will become something he feels comfortable doing in time. 
*** I picked up 7 pairs of $6 shorts that are comfortable and some underwear.
*** My daughter had a harder time finding stuff.
** Burlington
*** Logistics were all wrong. They didn't get the shipment. Plenty of slashed prices on what little remained. 
*** Picked clean for the cheapest stuff they had. 
* Fireman Time!
* Offspring took far too long trying to make dinner.
** After stepping in and upsetting everyone, I asked my wife to finish the preparing the meal so we could move on.
*** I'm a pain in the ass, but I'm correct. I clarified during [[h0p3ful Review]]. Ownership of timing is half the battle. I'm the one who teaches the hard lessons xor it won't get done.
* [[Family Gathering]]
** [[Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση]] presentations on [[Anaximenes]] and [[Pythagoras]]. 
*** Overall, good. They did not deliver what I asked for, but it was close and there was real work. They wrestled with me. 
*** Spent time thinking about their sources, historical context, and what it means to develop our own interpretations. 
** Pasta, sausage, red sauce, sweet potatoes+squash, and a lemon-ginger tea concoction. 
* Read+Write
* [[h0p3ful Review]]: I am exhausting to speak with. I know.
* Finished off what they had to finish off with me.
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 4
