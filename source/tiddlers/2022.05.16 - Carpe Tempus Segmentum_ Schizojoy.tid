My sympaticon made a chicken parm from thin air. It was dope. 

Woke at 8? Couldn't sleep again, but ruminated, dozed, and meditated. Woke at 11. Fireman Time! 

[[TTTOTW]]

//Inform the Men!// //Raw Skintime//. Shower of the gods!

[[D2]], Baal run. [[TTTOTW]].

[[Family Time]] @ 3ish. Pleasant. Vapelyfe. I paced a lot. Thinking about what kind of bathroom work we'll need to do. Ghosts of a meal past, +2 points. Curating a local gamer group seems like a fine way to acquire meaty friendships. The basement sans [[The Den]] seems particularly well-suited to an underground Commons.

Watched the final episode of //Sherlock//. Some 2nd Foundation [[power]]s up in there, seems to me. Some work on the walking stick.

It's finally hot enough in the house that people are busting out fans and ACs. Apparently, it may hit into the 90s next week. 

//Skintime// with my sympaticon. Quesadillas. Massage. //Children of Dune//. [[MTG]], Gobbos +0, in what is easily our longest and most epic game, with an outright misplay on my part to boot. She eventually overwhelmed me with almost no goblins left in her deck (pulsing). Played some guitar for a few minutes. Missing pieces I have loaned to [[others]]. Meh. It happens.

Saw [[DeathOfRobinhood]]'s message late. Hotdogs. //Children of Dune// + [[TTTOTW]]. Gotta say, after having been through it all again, they did a fine job with what they had.

Sleep by 12:30?

Woke at 8:30? Solid. //Skintime// with my sympaticon, planning, [[Morning Routine]]. [[5c0ut]] seemed wired this morning, and my daughter filled with a joyful sarcasm, plus an "explain to that retard 'tist once again how this whole language thing works for the umpteenth" `/hug`. Surprised to see [[CAldrich|@: CAldrich]] pop out of the woodwork to wave. `/wave`.

My sympaticon and I listened to real guitarists in tears. [[Beautiful]].

[[TTTOTW]]. [[Review]]ing my [[Chatlog]]s is an expensive experience, and I'm glad I do it. Story is different in 20/20ish (probably much blurrier and re-interpreted, and so forth).

Shopping @ Home Depot with my sympaticon. Wandered the plants with her (I rabbitholed, she looked). Picked up paint for a bathroom, another brush set, and a tit lamp.

Pulled everything out of the bathroom, unmounted everything, took out the old titlamp, washed everything down, fan-dried. No time to paint or add the light. Offspring went on a walk per my assignment. 

[[5c0ut]] came down for our bi-monthly 1-on-1. Finishing his spreadsheets to match his bank records. Planning on how to get him high as cheaply as possible. Talked about Dev. He knew everything well in advance. Held his hand, tears, and he's doing a good job.

[[TTTOTW]].

//The Commanding Heights: The Battle for the World Economy//, part 1 finished. Tons of rabbitholing today. Offspring made popcorn, and we also had some cookies. [[5c0ut]] and [[ASK]] joined us as well. My daughter answered almost every question with pure sarcasm, with a lack of precision and [[reconstruction]]. Not sure what to do for her cynicism, but I would feel that way in her shoes, especially at that age. Laundry.

Dadnap. Could not keep my eyes open.

//Skintime// with mi amor. Walked me through her day. 

[[AG]] is graduating, and I wish we could attend. She's no longer on Signal. I congratulate you here then. Congratz, girl. Into the world with you, I wish you [[luck]] beyond what I know how to explain to you. You've a lot to learn, and I'm pretty fucking terrified for you (as I am for my own offspring). Yes, you always have a place with us (though, we only have 1 bathroom, so that might be uncomfortable - but, I think you'd grow to like it here too).

[[Family Gathering]] was delicious. We had salad and the italian sausage bake. Lottery winner episode of //House//.

Called [[DeathOfRobinhood]]. All is clear. Thinking about family and life. Gradual changes in his life (but not small ones). He's feeling old, and he sounds it too in some respects. Always careful with his words. He continues to be the gentle giant, and his feelings are a source of reasons for me. 

[[MTG]]. MWC +0, lackey connect but otherwise unstoppable. `/toast: to intricate plans we forget`.
