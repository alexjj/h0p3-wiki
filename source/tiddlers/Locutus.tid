title: Locutus

!! Hype: 

* If successful, a "Freenet 2.0."
* A distributed decentralized application layer for the Internet, using a distributed key-value database, cryptographically enforced, with observer semantics for realtime p2p communication, built on libp2p, Rust, and WASM. 
* The design uses a small world network to allow nodes to self-organize where each has a location on a 1-d ring, similar to a distributed hashtable (the original Freenet uses the same approach). There is no global consensus as in the case of a cryptographic ledger.

!! Questions:

* Are you going to enable different drop-in replacement reputation or consensus options?
