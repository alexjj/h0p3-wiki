*** The bottom has to be fully democratized. =/. No one is funding a DAO for that. That's the way to go. It simply takes too many rare experts to come together to build the thing we need. That structure does have to be built though. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like a build-it-and-they-will-come thing. That means the framework has to be out-of-the-box useful for lots of communities, built to plug-in. Rust or Ada, right? If you aren't building that generalized, then I think there's something rotten at the core here.
