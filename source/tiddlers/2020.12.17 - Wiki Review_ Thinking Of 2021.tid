title: 2020.12.17 - Wiki Review: Thinking Of 2021

* [[2020.12.16 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Feed The Army Of The Living]]
** [[Family Gathering]]s have been great. Savor it while I can.
* [[2020.12.16 - Prompted Introspection: Intense Physical Pain]]
** I am [[grateful]] for Samwise's questions. It's a slap in the face. Wake the fuck up, [[h0p3]]! Lmao. 
** Also, I've noted several times lately that things get worse with age. 
** Physical pain isn't even close to what is most painful in my life.

** Completed. Hey, it's a chance to rework. [[The Remodeling]] has demonstrated that I have to transplant, which stalled out for us this year. I still don't see the point in going as custom as [[gwern]], especially given my technical requirements. I think finishing off [[Recent Obsessions]] and the [[Audit]]s + [[Link Log]] dumps while working on the house would be great, and then 2021 might be used to rebuild from scratch and graft back in.
