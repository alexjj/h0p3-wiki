title: 2021.08.25 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: I am become feel

[[TTTOTW]]. High-fructose pastry + water. [[TTTOTW]]. Took a shit. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! Attempted sleep by 6.

Woke at noon. I wake up to look at my notifications immediately (well, even before I actually wake-up, I take a sneakpeek, like a true loser). I am missing someone in my life (and that's okay, we have time).<<ref "p">> I really didn't sleep enough. Headache has held the entire time (but, I'm feeling pleased with my work lately, so I'll take the headache...reminds me of grad school sometimes). [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

//The Walk// with my offspring was dope. Vapelyfe. They did some work (enough to wrestle with me), so it was smoother sailing. Some cute females (guessing mother and daughter) stopped right where we were with quite a bit of glancing, etc. (and one can only hope it is the mustached dadbod bearbot with his chillun that made it worthwhile). He got his work done plus some Youtubes in. He's on the Roman Empire (opinionated mfer too, :P, [[good]]!), and she's still crawling through The Odyssey (way more carefully than I did). A discussion of the concept of Sirens, and then it spun off into tropes, SCP, [[???]], and vampiric phoenixes. 

I never received the call from the oil company. They said they would. I'll bug 'em. Absolute worst case scenario is a replacement of the entire system (not cheap), but I'm hoping it will be significantly less.

The offspring came down to the [[The Den]]geon to work on their projects. My daughter has been pricing out options, finding the butter zones, setting up a comparison chart. Now she's going to explore the technical possibilities given our price range and we may revise the draft given new information. My son has the VM set, cracked, sync, Signal, etc. He needs to have her wiki set completely. She needs to be able to walk up to the device and begin using it (we need to outline the rest of what needs to happen).

//Raw Skintime//. Her shower argument isn't merely irrational, it's mean and wrong (wrong, I tell you, wrong). Ate up spooning with a spoon. My stubble is sand-paper to her, and more than usual. She's been extra sensitive lately (already an extremist on this matter as a schizoautist). Her olfactory has been astounding, like she's hunting in the woods (which, you'd basically never catch my ADHD-bunny doing, not even to save her own life). Period, then storm, and I've not seen her sensitivity calm back down. Thought about the fact that we both were told we were "too sensitive" and failed to "respect authority" more often than most growing up. God damn autists. Oh, her partner at work (technically subordinate, but whatever) and they have bought pronoun pins, ace/pan trinkets, and she's encouraging her friend (pagan of some kind) to bring her Min sculpture (now sitting on top of her copy of //After The Orgy// in the office) to maximize their welcoming to the many religious people who show up (wide variety). I wager the golden cock would be 18" if it were scaled up (rail her, please).<<ref "S">>

She showed me her book, and it's basically all Greek to me. Begging for her to explore spaced repetition options. There's no reason not to hammer it price-efficiently (traditionally, the woman doesn't have to study very much [or at all], not even foreign languages like Hebrew, Japanese, and Spanish, but there's way more pressure and less time here). I'm sad that I probably won't see as much of her in the coming 6 years as I have in the past 6 (KMNplz). Nothing is set in stone yet, but if the class has room, I seriously doubt she won't be accepted (they'd be out of their minds).

[[Family Gathering]] was simple. We had a salad, many tomatoes sliced with tons of salt and pepper, and chicken pot pies. We watched two episodes of //House//, lawd. I got //Skintime// for the second episode. The Baby epidemic episode makes me cry every time.<<ref "i">> My offspring aren't as moved by many parts of the show, they they make jokes about it. I'm glad they are enjoying it. My son has been making jokes that I've missed, and good ones.<<ref "h">> His sister has to take him aside and say, "he didn't understand," XD. Son, your dad is retarded. You know it.

[[TTTOTW]]. Talked with [[AA]]. Her health is improving, her spirits high despite being quite tired (that whole family has so much on their plate). Summer was difficult for her; she thrives best with her classroom schedule (despite the insanity of the past 18 months). [[AG]] is on track with a reasonable robotics kit to my eyes; I hope she dives in and finds her people. [[TTTOTW]].

<<footnotes "S" "Didn't catch S offguard, but apparently it caught her friends offguard. Cool boss is cool boss.">>

<<footnotes "i" "I have to look away for a couple seconds in this one. It isn't my nightmare episode though. I can watch adults die all day, but I can't fucking handle watching children suffering and dying (once you're dad, you're always a dad). It's the over the top. I know it's my duty.">>

<<footnotes "h" "I have no idea how to define it, but his performance (not performativity, but an autonomous and sincere recognition of [[the other]]) has been perfectly awkward (as it must for a 13yo autistic manboy) and a special delight, as I get to see my son unfold and come alive in a way that I have long worried he might never be able choose or experience. Also, he's been cussing a lot. A lot a lot. He always has, but it's surged again to the point that we have to say, 'ya gotta try to cuss good if you're gonna cuss at all.'">>
