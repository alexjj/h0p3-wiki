!! Audit:

* Yes, I must reiterate: it's a {[[Vault]]} machine!
* I feel like I've completed a circuit here. 
** Standing back, the difference between that and my current culling (with explanations) feels huge. 
** Standing back, it also feels different from the previous year because it had so much feedback.
* Of the [[CDR]]s, this one gets the footnotes the most. It's also the only remaining paragraph form that I use.
* I've grown more used to my [[hlexicon]], and I'm less worried about the philosophical problematics. I like that shift!
* The interlocutors have almost disappeared. They are still there, but they are less necessary. 
** I have more of a say in the questions though, so I don't need to feel like someone else has asked it so much.
* Each [[CDR]] has its own pain points and overbearing heft, and this one seems to slip through the cracks more (in part because it can). 
** It becomes significantly more expensive to answer older questions. Thinking about those stories eventually deadends in many cases.
* Like most of the wiki, there is a plainness here (even a plain stupidity too). 
* Extremely high re-readability for me.
* I like the kind of pro-active mapping and searching it makes me do. I need more processes like that.
* I do not hold back even with family here. Lawd.
* 2019 was rougher than 2020 for me. That's absurd. I feel like I'm drowning in 2020, but maybe in an oxygen slurry? 
** The move to Yale has changed everything. It is profound luck.
* I have worked to not ruminate.
* Reminds me of Plebbit.
* I'm glad to have some that are just funny, stupid, silly, etc. I need that.
** I like the "shootin' the shit" approach too. I want to move toward that if I can. I [[hope]] to mitigate and reshape the self-righteousness in here.
* I think it's taken time for family members, including my wife, to appreciate that this is my primary medium and that there's good reasons for us to use it as a family to some [[dok]].
* [[Antipleonasm Analysis]] was too expensive to keep and do in a way that I liked. The bar is so much lower here. I'm really glad I kept it.
* Yeah, I miss [[chameleon]]'s. She gotsda do what she gotsda do tho. I get it.
** This year has been fucking crazy for her. 
** Would be dope if she got to be a consultant. She has a fearless openness to just diving in. Would be hard to find projects that she would really love working on though, understandably.
* I've actually had nostalgia in here. I normally think that is a huge redflag with most people. I feel [[grateful]] to experience it though. 
* This log has been like a heartbeat for me. Yeah, //calm lightning// is a great phrase. Calmly braided lightning.
** And, I [[hope]] that my dialectical ball of lightning as a whole can move that direction fittingly too.
* I am glad that I'm feeling more comfortable with emoting. [[Sphygmus]] is an inspiration here too.
* This one has done SO much work in [[Family Time]]. It's ramped up slowly.
* `/salute`. Congratz, sir. 2019 was a success on this front. I am so glad you worked on this project.
