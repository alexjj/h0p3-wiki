; 1937: Nagel

* We cannot altogether abandon our subjectivity and fully objectify our knowledge (from a 'view from nowhere')
* Objective knowledge about an organism's behavior and physiology doesn't allow us to form a conception of its subjective experience.
* Materialism is incomplete even as a theory of the physical world includes conscious organisms.
* Any evolutionary account of the place of reason presupposes reason's validity and cannot confirm it without circularity.
* Consciousness, reason, and value cannot be products of evolution; they might be among the basic aspects of universe, guiding evolution.
* Ethics is a branch of psychology.
* There are prudential, rational, timeless, internal reasons for action, independent of our current concerns.
* Reasons for action are impersonal; if I act in some way on my own behalf of others similarly.
* Only beings capable of practical reason can recognize value but once they recognize it, they find it in the lives of creatures without reason or consciousness.
* There is no crucial experiment to establish/refute moral realism; its validity is a comparative matter, sit is in other domains. (science, history, etc.)
* Given a knockdown argument for an intuitively unacceptable conclusion, one should assume there is probably something wrong with the argument.
