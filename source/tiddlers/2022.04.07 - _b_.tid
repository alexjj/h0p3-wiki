I have worked hard to reserve my cynicism for used car salesmen and politicians, but given the number of political animals trying to sell me their self-serving stories in the hyperindividualistic deserts I wander, my minimum level of cynicism seems to rise only higher (as a control-mage, I'm fine turtling; it's one of my classic stances). I am so [[grateful]] for the exceptions. Thank you.

Surely the ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî± is an area known to the few who have wandered it as a ~~trainwreck~~ hotspot for spiritual possession. Symptoms include confusion, dementia, alien thoughts, speaking in unknown gibberish languages, false memories, and waking trances.

As an Elder^^tm^^ of the First Self-Righteous Church, I only pick up my belief systems because I [[like]] their style, I want to like myself, and I'm convinced my particular consumption of this buffet will finally make me happy (which is all I really care about). I relate to other people on the interwebs who have also had psychosis, because, like, you know, i was god once too, and if no one knows what you are doing, then surely you are doing it wrong.

Insofar as Saint^^tm^^ Heidegger describes the danger of technology as not merely a set of means to ends, but as a mode of being in the world where everything, including ourselves, is perceived as an instrumental resource for exploitation, he'd have (accidentally, perhaps) picked out the underlying problems in the Will to [[Power]] from a Marxian perspective. Of course, this does not escape fundamental teleology, nor does he sufficiently address egoism from his anti-realist position (I doubt a Nazi would*). Safeguarding the poetic mode of being in the world does not solve the problem, though I'll agree it is necessary. [[Faith]] in a divinity not of our own creation or choice is not easy for many to accept. Here, Buber's "I and Thou" (a clear application of Saint Kant) picks out the issue well enough: we ought not treat our interactions with other people as mere means to ends (nor they themselves as mere means, and, ofc, this is a higher calling than most are willing to even conceive), as all true relationships are something like proxies for the fundamental relationship between each of us and the divine. As I have said many times, we must contend with the ancient Aristotelian contradiction of speaking of the unity of [[The Good]] here, as it is difficult to interpret what it means to say that our lives are means to ends greater than ourselves and yet that, to some [[dok]], we are ends in ourselves as well. There's no wisdom to see things without seeing through other things. May process theology save us all. Though there is much suffering, there is an observable magic to our lives, and perhaps there's an inexhaustable philosophical whitehole of metafictional creative absurdity to peek into as well.

Thinking there's nothing more than an [[infinigress]] of masks to the self is parallel to the problem of the representation of the thing-in-itself. As //Mu//ing cows, many postmoderns ultimately deny a self they require for solipsism, which almost appears the cogent and justified move until bracketing freezes the entire process of flattening. Oh, yes, my method points out that there was no real point to any methods, `/sniff`. We get to see what people are made of when they hit the contradictions. It's not just that anything beyond our own experience requires a leap of [[faith]], our own experience requires it as well, all the way down. No, no, "nothing" makes sense, right?
