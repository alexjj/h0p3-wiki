title: 2020.12.29 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Chill

* Bought Sexual Wellness Products.<<ref "i">> 
** I shall spare everyone the details. I wish people luck. `/salute` 
** Note that the price of me not being convinced that you will research and understand each object will be a walkthrough of each item. Not a problem for me, but you can avoid it if you want. Ask yourself if you know how the object is used safely and how to maintain it well.
* Try To Take Over The World
* Fireman Time!
* //House of Cards// 
* Sleep by 8
* Woke at 11:30
** Offspring were working, so I cannot complain about the noise.
** Basement is saner, but we still have a huge trash/recycling problem. 
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Chats
* Oil Rep Failed To Show Again. Not A Good Sign.
** Here's a good one though: electric bill was $90!! WHOA.
* ⁸Δ⁸
** She had a chill day. Both did. 
* Clean & Organize
* [[MTG]]
** Son's MUC vs Shitfinity +3, +3: colorscrewed both times, burnout on first before stabilization, but shackles hit the second and it was over. Time Walk is a good card. Who knew?
** Son's MUC vs Affinity +1, +1: Clampcycling the deck both games, dangerous 1-landers with plenty of glue and gas. Fun talking permission.
* //The Walk//
** We have a path on the street.
** Looking at maps, don't see a way not to use private property just yet. Long-term, it is lookin' like a decent possibility though. 
** Interesting looking at other houses for the first time in {[[Dream]]}ing about our own. 
* Try To Take Over The World
* [[Family Gathering]]
** My daughter made roasted potatoes. That //was// the meal. Amazing. I'm going to bet she didn't keep her recipe. `/breath`. That was a keeper. She's worried it's way too unhealthy. But...it was delicious. Make drugs, kids. 
* Dialecture
** They didn't seem to mind their presents. Made sense to them. Good.
* Putting together my wife's room
** Offspring assisted for a bit. My daughter immediately knows it is a lesson. XD. Well, pay attention then, show me where it's wrong.
* Inform the Men!
* Meditation
* Worked on offspring's computers. 
* Putting together my wife's room
** Desk is operational. Glad she picked up another charger. 
*** Gonna find a happy medium for her computing.
