title: 2021.08.04 - Prompted Introspection: Refuse To Answer

!! Given the guarantee that nobody will ask you the question: what is a question you would refuse to answer?

That's an odd question, Samwise. I don't understand how the former affects the latter, except that you prevent me from being cheeky by claiming your question to be what I'd paradoxically refuse to answer.

I refuse to thoroughly answer questions of how to build powerful authoritarian surveillance systems, more brutal governance, and far more efficient slavery.<<ref "t">> We've only touched the tips of these icebergs; we could melt them all. I'm glad that people are bad at being inhumane, that they don't take it to the level of insanity I could. If the goal was to centralize [[power]], I could manufacture it like only an autist playing a [[vidya]] [[game]] could. If I hated our species, how would I work to make life hell for everyone? You don't want a Bean or a Rainman helping the captain of such a ship. I joke about [[TTTOTW]], but if I meant to be evil, I'd be a dangerous human being (and I try to fight what may be akin to evil clones of me in the world from this here ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱). I don't climb, and I can't if I'm going to be moral. It is better that I am here answering your hilarious question, Samwise. I'm going to be completely ineffective, but I'm going down with the ship fighting.
