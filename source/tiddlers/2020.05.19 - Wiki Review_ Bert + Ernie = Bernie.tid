title: 2020.05.19 - Wiki Review: Bert + Ernie = Bernie

* [[2020.05.18 - Prompted Introspection: All About Me]]
** I'm cutting through a ton of [[prompt]]s. It's refreshing. 
*** I'm hoping that between [[Sphygmus]] and [[j3d1h]]'s approaches, I'll find a method for narrowing it down into strong sections of evolving and highly fit [[prompt]]s.
* [[2020.05.18 - TDL: Drown]]
** Hey, it's fine. You get what you get done. Your art is cool AF, dude. The drowning in the rabbithole is part of it.
* [[2020.05.18 - Wiki Review: Weâ€™ve got holy scripture here that proves us to be right, for believing out loud what we wish to be true]]
** Better late than never though, right? =)
*** Your goal is to do a decent job at the impossible.
* [[2020.05.18 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: On The Horse]]
** I think she's going to be unhappy with it. =/. I assume it would be good for my sleep though.
*** Part of the problem is that I still have to get out of bed sometimes to write. I can't fall asleep because "oh wait!" moments.
* [[2020.05.18 - Wiki Audit: Slow as the DMV]]
** I'd like to know how we can change TW core in a minimal way, in an easy to upgrade manner. This full transplant shit is a terrible option.
*** Although, it gives us a chance to try new tech out entirely. We've done this before. Part of the problem is that I will have to give up my beloved font inside the editor to handle this. 
**** Jermolene has asked a couple times if this needs to be changed. I feel unhappy asking him to make this change to the whole of TW just for mine. 
***** If I'm going to ask for a change, I want it to be something critical to everyone's wikis.
* [[2020.05.18 - BL: Catching Up]]
** As usual, I'm taking forever. I am not sure what all I need to say either.
* [[Metaphilosophy]]
** I should collect more [[Neat]] things. 
** I need to walk through these. A [[good]] philosopher should continue to climb this mountain.
* [[2020.05.18 - BDS97: Stories]]
** Hrm. I am saddened to see The Slip here. =/. People change. I am an unfun friend in that space.
* [[Gratitude]]
** I'm grateful that someone chose this. I really like when we pick up crucial normative concepts for analysis. They might not be terribly deep and difficult, but that's okay.
*** Now that we are 2 at week, it's clear that we can't cover the entire encyclopedia before they turn 18. Even a few hundred topics would still be hella good (even most academic philosophers I know don't attempt this silly thing). 
* [[2020.05.18 - h0p3ful Review: Proof]]
** The boy might enjoy calculus. Cantor would be fun for him too. I can't push in every direction. I can suggest. I will push for him to have good testing scores at this point, and we will watch [[vidyas]] and engage in discussions for curiosity, but the rest has to be up to him on this front.
*** I spend my push-currency on particular pragmatics, hacking, and philosophy now. It's my bet against the world as their father.
* [[2020.05.18 - h0p3ful Review: Kant Stahp, Won't Stop]]
** I am feeling better about her work. There's a real chance that by the end of the summer, she'll have her machines singing.
*** The oldest is the guinea pig. It's a good thing they tend to have the highest IQs to handle their parent's stupidity (and malice).
