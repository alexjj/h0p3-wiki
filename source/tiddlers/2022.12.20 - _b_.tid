the atomization of society: leaving the identity you were born into became the norm, surround yourself with people who don't give a fuck about where you came from (or who you are at all, perhaps), rummage through a sea of strangers for chosen family and your apparently self-constructed identity, a stranger to everyone, including yourself, make up fictions about who you are that no one will hold you accountable to (or if they did, you just move on to the next), and narcissism becomes the dominant strategy

Surely, Saint Kant read some Hindu texts; and it would be sad if he didn't read the Bhagavad Gita. The prescription of acting from duty is uncanny.

Anyone who tells you to be concerned about AI-alignment without having picked out how the most [[power]]ful people on the planet are likely to wield AIs to centralize power are avoiding signaling their selfishness.

In the hard places, you must work to set aside your wounds and the aspects of injustices committed against you alone, stop caring about your happiness in those respects, and simply focus on how you serve others [[irwartfrr]]. Live your life in such a way that it isn't about yourself. Of course, there may be no one you should trust all the way down or who really deserves happiness, but that's not your fault. The only reward is the knowledge that you did the right thing for the right reasons, but that provides justification for other kinds of happiness. Ironically, the only way to deserve happiness is to be virtuous enough not to pursue it at the expense of the needs of others. Enjoy the accidental happiness that does arise, and know you deserve it.

My mother, [[R]], has argued that [[faith]] is ultimately personal rather than communal. It is here that I think she is closest to being correct: it is true that every creature on Earth dies alone, and it is also true in some spaces of the desert that each creature must travel alone, no matter how many other creatures seem to surround them. Who will you be for and with these creatures? When what you have to [[share]] is [[good]]will that won't even be understood as such, when you will be persecuted and misunderstood, maligned and rejected, when it costs you your own dignity to pursue [[justice]], when you let go of everything else but [[love]] for [[The Other]] while you are alone: [[faith]] is as personal as it gets. And, yet, there is no me without we, without community. Self self-described entangled with [[other]] is our plight.
