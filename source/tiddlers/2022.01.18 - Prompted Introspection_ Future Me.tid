Dear Future [[h0p3]],

I expect that you will continue to make your classic distinction between "expectations" and "predictions." I expect that you do your best. I expect you to [[masturbate]] where fitting. I don't even know if you'll be alive, but I expect you to work hard given your {[[Axioms]]}. 

And, I'm {[[Dream]]}ing my ninja penguins, like, please take the time to write a worthy [[review]] of the me that was. Take a second to remember how I feel right now and read my {[[Vault]]}, [[audit]] some, do what you can, and I'll be doing the same for you. I think you should do it in three years. Fuck yeah, I [[like]] the drama of closing me out with the new year. Truly put my turmoil to rest for me. You know how much I love the symbolic turning of potential. Take a moment for that treasured deep sigh of satisfaction. Wherever you are; you made it. Let's be [[good]] people together, serve each [[other]] and all [[others]] togheter [[irwartfrr]],<<ref "TOP">> and I love you. `/hug`.

[[Love]],

[[h0p3]]

~~p.s. Sorry, I'm mailin' this one in, broski. You know [[hao]] [[itdo]]. {[[Dream]]} hard. [[Good]] [[luck]], sir. `/salute`.~~
