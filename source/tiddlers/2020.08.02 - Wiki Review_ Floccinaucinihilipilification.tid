title: 2020.08.02 - Wiki Review: Floccinaucinihilipilification

* [[2020.07 - Wiki Review]]
** This isn't rational, but I'm blindly wondering if and what it means to apply linear logic's restrictions on copying or deleting premises to the metawork that goes on in the [[review]]. Perhaps it doesn't apply at all. 
* [[2020.07 - TDL]]
** Yeah, it's still the weakest thing I build each day. I don't feel as bad about it. Now that [[TTP]]s have settled significantly, this one shows up more brightly for me.
* [[2020.07 - Prompted Introspection]]
** I'm increasingly curious about how I might grow this thing. It seems like I could use 500-1000 new ones. I really want to maintain some objectivity too. 
* [[2020.07 - Link Log]]
** The flood is overwhelming. There's always too much to read in the world, but this year has drowned me. I'm glad that I've gone from nothing to saying something.
** I can't wait until my offspring decide this is something they want to engage in again and more seriously.
* [[2020.07 - Family Log]]
** I'm [[grateful]] that my wife understands TW enough to make inferences about my offspring's choice not to work in many cases. 
** I have had many [[Family Log]]s in weeks in which my offspring failed to write almost anything. I'm not looking forward to that occurring again. It will though.
** It gives us the opportunity to question our narratives together too. My daughter is most likely to hang with the critical/SJW/self-proclaimed-libleft crowd, and I can imagine this will be a fascinating practice for her to consider with them.
* [[2020.07 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum]]
** Since the addition of the primary question of [[Family Log]], [[CTS]] has become something I want to flesh out even further.
** My school with my offspring has gone off the rails. However, I've had a great summer otherwise. 
** Welp, the hematite is no go for their cicada beads. We don't have a heavy bead that makes sense.
* [[2020.08.01 - TDL: Family]]
** Still a terrible feeling. I'm so tired of calling them out here.
* [[2020.08.01 - Wiki Review: Le Bots]]
** Alright, presumably, remote randoms will be treated with even less respect. It will be harder for outsiders to find their way in.
* [[2020.08.01 - Prompted Introspection: Get Boring]]
** Edited. Rethinking about it is ends up being more than a reminder. I do feel it narrowing.
* [[2020.08.01 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Hammertime]]
** Completed. Everyone to their own rooms for the evening worked fine.
** In JC, we couldn't afford to not shop this long (we simply didn't have space). The pantry we filled out in January has been a source of flexibility.

** I have no idea if I will go again for it. It's an interesting experience. At the very least, it sharpens some of my tools.
*** Practice is practice. The fact is that I need more practice with randos. I'm not here to speak with a room of high status people.
*** It's a reasonable place for charity too. It is unlikely they'll have a chance to wrestle with someone like me.
** ML looks like it is going to become a dangerous weapon eventually. We've not seen a botnet wield it significantly yet.
