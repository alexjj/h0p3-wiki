title: 2020.06.02 - Prompted Introspection: Methodism

!! What organizations have you belonged or do belong to?

You son of a bitch, [[2019.02.05 - Prompted Introspection: I'm in.]]<<ref "i">> Time to roll out my leet street cred, of course. I've been watching Rick & Morty since before it was cool. I'm, like, a real, true, hardcore fan; this show defines me all the way down. Basically, it's like a religion for me. I hang out with losers like my brothers, so that's how I find the underground stuff on mainstream television. Eventually people stopped looking at me funny for a while when I raved about this show. Now they look at me funny again.<<ref "4">> Will Dan Harmon screw the pooch? Maybe I need to write him. Happy to donate my time for that shit.

I used to be a United Methodist. Represented at conference. It was rare that I met a pastor who knew more than I did about their own theology. These years later I see that it was a mere simulation; I aim to help those stuck in that tar pit when I can. I'm glad to see they's slowly breakin' up and losing membership. `/tears-of-joy`. I can't wait until the Boomer generation dies off. I'll destroy the syncretists too. Yet, the [[Straussian]] account of Saint Jesus is the real deal; that fiction I still respect.
