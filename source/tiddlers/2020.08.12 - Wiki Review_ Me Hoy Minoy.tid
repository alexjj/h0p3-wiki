title: 2020.08.12 - Wiki Review: Me Hoy Minoy

* [[2020.08.11 - Link Log: lmao]]
** Apparently, I owe my daughter an essay on Broski. I've chosen [[this one|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZIJ16mQqn0]]. I see now how this artist just is my bruvnah and broski: he spits to piano. It's mesmerizing and maybe somewhat benignly pointless (unlike this fine essay). I think it's their voices that take us there. Furthermore, now that you have used this word, [[j3d1h]], I'm not going to be able to stop talking about it. No, your mother can't help you here; you will only empower the troll. Thus, I conclude, this is a song about what this essay was supposed to be about.

** It's a weird discovery about myself. I'm not a dog person, but I am kinda a dog-person. Plus, I like Dogbert.

** I think if people saw what I did, they would panic a lot more.

** You did fine. Parts of the equation just aren't up to you.

** I thought I was gonna try to grow it out (eventually, stop having to cut it at all would be neat), but it's so hot. 
** Everyone stamped "yes" up the foodchain on it. Maybe it's more useful than it looks. I doubt it.
*** I don't like how S so brazenly lies in such a way that he puts everyone else's social capital on the line. It's obvious he acts as though he speaks on behalf of my wife (and anyone else he wishes). He gets caught often too (and, the turmoil makes more and more sense). I'm thankful to see only one overt wolf so far; I'm sure I'll find more.
