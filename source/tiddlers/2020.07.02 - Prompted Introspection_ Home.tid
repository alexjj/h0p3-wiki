!! What is a place that inspires you?

I remember the conversations we were having regarding [[2019.06.22 - Prompted Introspection: Natural Drugs]]. I've spent an awful lot of time teaching my offspring to have rich spaces in which to bracket and doubt themselves and what they see, [[WINTCIS]].<<ref "p">> It's expensive to reason about uncertainty wisely. To whatever extent it can be had, if we are going to have integrity in the process, we have to work toward knowing how much we don't know. If they even attempt to explicitly do so (which is sadly too rare in itself), I usually see people engage in buffet-style belief acquisition and discharge (whatever floats their boat and maintains their unjustifiably biased narrative); it's particularly egregious when people have no interest in coherence or justification but masquerade as though they do. There is a [[Straussian]] component to attempting a blanket lack of charity across the board too. It washes away some kinds of delusions.

My home inspires me. I don't mean the building, obviously. I'm not saying we're terribly inspirational either. We give me something to fight for though. Sure, we drive each other insane often enough. There's gonna be ups and down. I want a better world-at-all when I live in this small one.

That's just a {[[dream]]}, but maybe it could be happily realized. Up to them. I don't have a right to pick anything out here in the principal-agent problem.">>
