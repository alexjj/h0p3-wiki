Can't quite put 2 and ~2 together, you know what I mean? Maybe we are worried about a bridge from perfect continuity to perfect discreteness (both in math and physics from what I can see) and a problem of two kinds of infinity that can't be solved in mathematics unless we take up The Dialetheia (apparently essential to [[It]]).

Unfortunately, the word "wholesome" is usually a redflag. I see addiction pretty often in that sphere.

Hao 2 Narcissist (a shout-out to people with sepsis): I convince you that I'm inevitably right while claiming any doubts of your own beliefs or experiences are always signs of your dysfunction. Please, babysit my fragile ego while thrust into a sea of self-[[doubt|Question Everything]]. My identity vascillates without integrity, denying all intersubjectivities, labels, and selfhoods. I spew skeptically circuitous word salad and ad hominem to disorient your stance and disrupt your ability to challenge me because I was never arguing with you in the first place: I was arguing with only myself in long, draining monologues `/wink`. My expression of my feelings always invalidates yours in competition, and each counterpoint only feeds me a supply to continue the drama. I presume to know what you're thinking and feeling, chronically jump to conclusions with insufficient evidence, constantly ignore nuance, put words into your mouth, preemptively accuse you of being toxic before you can accuse me, argue to persuade rather than find the truth, strawman + nitpick to move goalposts and burdens of proof at every turn, and derail any attempts to hold me responsible for my errors. If I were to apologize, it is only to reset the battlefield for a more ferocious attack. I do not compromise: you are never enough unless you continue to vie for my approval and validation. I deserve to be the center of your universe, and I'll isolate you, humiliate you, and train you to fear what makes you feel happy because your happiness represents what I know I will never have but feel like I deserve more than you (and if I can't have it, you can't either). I test your boundaries to know which ones I can trespass at which prices, and I always push the envelope. I will condescendingly, sarcastically, and patronizingly castigate you for having no sense of humor, being too sensitive, and playing useless word games when you genuinely argue about what is clearly just a joke, dude: you were only ever a joke to me, and so is my interaction with you at every level. I don't believe any of this really matters deep down, and I'm existentially bored, my masturbatory-mirror-tool-toy. I play with my food like a cruel predator. I will manufacture conflict, smear, harrass, and bait you like a guerrilla, exposing you in terms of my projection. I gossip constantly and report back fictions of what others say about you. I play with your insecurities, interrupt your confidence with unsettling catchphrases, and reenact disturbing experiences to open wounds ([[ITS]], ofc). I micromanage your every move, and I condition you to hypervigilantly self-censor so that it's cheaper to silence you.

Write your own stories, document the threats you face, reiterate your experiences across varied networks to generate diverse defensive triangles, greyrock stonewall against unjustified escalation in [[Gradual]]ized [[T42T]], and spend that energy on that which has merit instead. Be critical (though not anti-realist) in your pursuit of generalizations, absolutist language, and labels, particularly when there are principal-agent skin in the game imbalances. Know what you said, state "I did not say that" when it's true, and broken record repeat what (and eventually merely point to where) you did say and what you said you said (ad infinitum) instead. Slow saccharine things down, and strike balance in learning what it means to stand in conflict with a person. Reinforce boundaries that were proven justified in your Bayesian update.

It is often possible to choose not to live in someone else's cesspool of dysfunction, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't. With humility, one must engage in justified ad hominem of oneself and others. Yes, we are in the business of clarifying, culling, and justifying our feelings, just as we are directly or indirectly regarding our judgments, memories, stories, and cognitions. Cold calculations are not necessarily callous, contemptuous, or unkind. Justified motivation seeks something external because conceptionally only the external can be self-justified all the way down, but you must guard these {[[axioms]]} carefully against parasites.

It's [[common sense]] to trust someone's actions more than their words. The problem we face in a ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 is that most of the actions just are words and stories. That's part of why I require some [[CTS]] elements to tie one's life back to a set of actions that can be verified. We are not always justified in taking more time to respond, but we should be paranoid about those who regularly punish us for taking the time and space to reevaluate. Unfortunately, we cannot avoid revealing our vulnerabilities in all cases, especially in a ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱, but we can seek evidence of someone's character before we let our guard down.
