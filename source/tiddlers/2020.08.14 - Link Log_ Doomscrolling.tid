*** This borderline religious (at the very least, we have to say it's cool AF) perspective shows up inside several kinds of nested formal logics too.
*** I hope my offspring dive deep here. They've had a headstart like so few people their age here.

* Think About It

*** I don't know how to make a protocol simple enough with easy to walkthrough justifications. At best one makes a ladder of spheres or emerging webs. There's a sense in which democracy isn't democracy without everyone actively sharing in the computation of the democracy and the meta components for whatever is simulated. Computational infrastructure is a radically different set of nested universes compared to any other transportation system.

*** I have no idea what the impact would be. In your face cold fucking war. USD, realty, and stock market (which isn't tracking the economy) seem to be the safest bets for capital gains, but they aren't trustworthy (though fiat backed by the most effective imperialist in history [working hard to inject even its own legal systems everywhere] and a system that encourages foreign ownership). I see no reason to think China would open up. Capital flight appears to be not just a problem for China but the US as well (less immediately though); I simply don't know what would replace the USD as reserve currency nor where to put that much money. I hate so fucking much that arms and gold continue to look riper for the picking.

*** Google knows how to fight anti-trust on the cheap. FF is leashed, and I don't see how to unleash it without the unbifurcated Rule of Law necessary to tax the wealthy and funnel it correctly.
*** Simplify for forking. That is what they have to do. Anything that isn't fork-centric is a failure here. Google is going to continue to arms-race them off this extension/extinguish cliff. 
*** I still don't understand the implications of killing off Servo (in a way, it does simplify).

*** `/sigh`. Purposely missing the point.
