title: 2021.10.15 - Prompted Introspection: To Be Raped Or Falsely Accused Of Rape, That Is The Question

!! Would you rather be raped or falsely (but convincingly) accused of rape?

There are many ways to be raped ([[ridtyawtr]]), and you may find that in the ultimate moral analysis, those two options are more similar than they initially appear. Though I think consent is a quagmire of a topic, I think rape comes in more [[dok]] than many people recognize (just as I do for slavery, of which rape is itself a kind or cluster of kinds), and I think it's far more common than most people want to recognize (yet, by that token, I also think many instances of rape are less damaging than most people are willing to recognize as well). Do you mean to select at random or from average cases of rape according to my broad definition, or do you have something more specific in mind? I can pick out examples of being raped that are so horrific that I'd rather not live at all, and, therefore, it's easy to pick out instances of rape in which I'd rather commit suicide, and therefore, at least in some cases, I would also prefer a false accusation in which I were granted to the opportunity to commit suicide (or achieve something better).

Though I have many privileges, and even in a possible context in which a false rape accusation would tend not to have major negative outcomes for me or anyone around me (which I find highly unlikely), just the 2% risk would alter my Bayesian regret calculus dramatically. I can't give a solid answer without you making more explicit the definition or parameters of the "being raped" choice alongside the particular predictions of being convincingly false accused of rape. If we go by a broad definition and my estimated averages: I'd choose to be raped. I consider that the lower risk. I'm not confident about that choice though.
