title: 2020.10.26 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Armpit Licking

Need to get the SUV set. I'd much rather she drive in the snow with it. My schedule eases burdens, but it also is so tempting too. 

* Woke at 3am
* Read+LoL
* AFireman Time!
* Attempted sleep by 6
* Kiss, then sleep by 7?
* Woke at 1pm
* [[Morning Routine]]
** Wrists are hurting.
* Strawberries, apple, bagel+millennial-fruit, nuts + LoL
* Walk With Offspring
** Pure hell for 60% of it. Nobody wanted to be there. We walked through the long-term consequences of these behaviors. Informed consent will continue to get more informier and more consentier. 
** Thankfully, everyone was willing to change topics and cheer up with fun discussions. I want to work on that. I'd like to make it so that the last half is as fun as I can get it.
** Saw Howard and Ellen. He had a dashing hat (not sure what kind, but like...oversized beret). We gently passed each other.
* We were going to head out to pick up the battery...but it didn't happen, again.
* Thought about her day with her. She's doing a great job navigating the bullshit.
* Meow continues to lick my armpit in a show of solidarity. It's an every other day kind of thing, and I don't understand. There are many armpits I would worshippingly lick, but I wouldn't lick my armpits. 
* //Skintime// Conversion: Inform the Men!
** Fuck responsibility. Just fuck.
* Meditation
* Shower of the gods!
* Offspring and I cooked dinner
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Beef, sprouts, melon, kiwi. 
** //ATLA//
*** No, they didn't do their schoolwork. I'm tired of trying. It was enjoyable.
* Nap in lap with a weighted blanket. 
* Woke at 11:45
* Read

Sleep is all over, but it's good. If I'm tired, I take it. That blanket is making it easier to fall asleep; I feel more likely to be able to let go with it.. Fucking autist. =). Slowly catching up on LoL too.
