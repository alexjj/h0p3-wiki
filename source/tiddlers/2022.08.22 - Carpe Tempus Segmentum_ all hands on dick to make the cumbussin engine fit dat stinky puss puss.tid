Woke at 3:30. Real sleep. //Skintime// with my sympaticon. Brix, like a savage, with no device. [[TTTOTW]]. Snacks + //ATLA//. [[TTTOTW]]. Sleep again by unknown time.

Woke at 11:30? Good. [[TTTOTW]].

Mi amor woke. Exhausted. I'm glad she is hoarding that anti-histamine for anxiety. We have something we know works. 

My sympaticon made cheesy grits with tomatoes for us. A LolVod.

[[Family Time]] @3? Brief. It's really different without my offspring having wikis they've woven into their lives. //Stranger Things//. Whoever packed what we had was off by two episodes. That is quite rare.

[[TTTOTW]].

My sympaticon made chicken parm for us. Plans for shopping. //ATLA//.

Sleep by 9? Zonked.

Woke at 12:45. Dreaming of [[Monsternix]]: a good sign. Blazing hot. All the ice cubes in the house have been consumed, but at least the trays are filled. Got me some water, had me some danish (delicious, and thank you). [[TTTOTW]].

//Skintime// with my sympaticon. //ATLA//. [[TTTOTW]]. Saw mi amor off. She's in a good mood! [[TTTOTW]]. Sleep again by 8?

A wild [[digidocTN]] appears...A wild Bootjuice48 appears...

Woke at 11:45. Meditation. [[TTTOTW]]. Got ready to go shopping. The Beast isn't here. Hrm. Alrighty then. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

Offspring came down to grind. They are bored of calculus, and I think unhappy with not having a clear way to solve problems. Resorting to algebraic tricks and guessing does feel like wasted work. It's not playful enough. Alright, fuck it. Programming it is. Progress today too. 

Talking to solar folks again. This is getting absurd. They did check-in with our power company again recently. Still annoyed. Not feeling happy today, and trying not to let that get in the way of being useful to what matters. I have no reasonable room to complain either. I've gotten to spend time with so many folks I love today. It's a gift.

[[D2]] + //Dresden Files// @01:04:04:07:03. We found two guardian angels and a summoner skiller. 

[[5c0ut]] came down. Been a day for him. Lots went wrong. Seems recovered. Did some paperwork at home before checking in at work again. ⁸Δ⁸.

Shopping @ Aldi with my sympaticon. We were like ninjas, despite how busy the place was. Bare minimum. 

Shopping @ W-Entity with my sympaticon. Dranks. Milk. They had zero cheese. Got lemons for cake. 

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. M is on leave (still not axed), and that throws a bunch of odds questions to several departments given union rules. One more day of work, then 3 days of orientation. Exciting. I only have to make one appearance, at the BBQ. I will do my best not to annoy anyone. //Inform the Men!//

[[TTTOTW]]. Met a granny (among a surprisingly wide variety of geriatrics) on Gigatribe (they do a much better job in the F2F model of finding people) who has an intel burntest exe in her shared shortlist of software. XD. Jesus. We are old. 

[[Family Gathering]] was delicious. We had asian pulled pork on either bread or rice, with some veggies and sauce. Water. Offspring had many sweets to makeup for the pain of watching //House of Cards//. I am [[grateful]] for their patience.

[[TTTOTW]]. Chatting with Sir [[Troglodyte]]. 

My sympaticon lowered my ears. I even have a dash in my eyebrow with the crazy long hairs. I look within 10 years of my age now. Goldilock's Bear. Shower. 

Ice cream + [[D2]] + //Dresden Files// @01:05:02:07:03. [[TTTOTW]]. Tomatoes co-worker gave. Got an heirloom look to them, and they taste real (on the autistic edge, imho). Delicious.
