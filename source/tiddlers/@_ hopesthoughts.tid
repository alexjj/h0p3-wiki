Yes, ma'am. You let me know if I can be of any use to you, please.

I'm definitely thinking about deleting all acounts and starting from scratch at this point.

`/salute`. Probably a scraper. In case you've not detected it from the person page or tag, I'm currently drafting here: [[2021.11.17 - hopesthoughts: Redaction]].

Sure I'll bookmark that page, however I use the email notifications feature. This way I know when I have a message, so I can respond.

I do the same with HN, I use HN replies. http://hnreplies.com/

I'm going to ask that you take down anything that reveals my full complete legal name and location. Simply because if my family were to find it at some point, they'd be freaking out. My parents do not like the fact that I post online. They think it compromises their privacy somehow, and it probably does. I'm sure that you went on to find my address and all my personal information. Since my parents are afraid of having their privacy compromised by my internet antics, I try to post without using my legal name, last name, and location in most cases. I agreed to do the interview back in 2009, because I thought it would help the place I was interning with at the time. I had no other reason for doing that. I've been in the paper and on TV multiple times before that. Every time I received a piece of equipment when I was a kid, my teacher called the local press. As you saw I didn't publish that because it was going to deanonymize me, and then you went ahead and did it anyway without asking me. I'm also going to ask that you keep private messages and emails private. If you can't do this then we can't have further exchange. If you want to draft your responses to me in public that's fine, however I ask that you keep my side of the conversation just between you and I.+

Also this isn't mine. https://www.splintertalk.io/@hopeslife/comments I do not nor have I ever had a Hive account. I used to use Steemit at one point, but nothing like that. If I did it would be inside my password manager, and it's nowhere to be found.

Often, my messaging just comes from here (you can bookmark this page). I much prefer this to plebbit. What do think you? Note that this page is tagged with [[hopesthoughts]] (is that link clearly accessible to you?). I try to stay relatively organized, though, obviously, this is a crazy mess.

That makes sense.

Normally, I speak entirely from my hypertext. Btw, here's where I usually message from: https://philosopher.life/#%40%3A%20hopesthoughts

Like this. I've never gotten the chat to work that well. I do use the older version of Reddit, however, I have a browser that uses the new one, and the chat doesn't work at all with that.

We're going to have to take this to regular private messages.

Still writing the follow-up letter. I draft in the open.
