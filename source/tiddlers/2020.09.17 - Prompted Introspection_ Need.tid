!! What do you need right now?

An answer. Probably the right question too. What do I want to do right now? Selfishly curl-up into a ball, live the faux Libertarian cowboy dream-life, and sleep in a gussied up basement like Dale Gribble (I will breed rats for sustenance). 

I don't know what I need. That's a shitty answer. I need to know what I need.
