title: Question Everything

//[[ITS]], De omnibus dubitandum//

<<<
I was never aware of any other option but to question everything.

-- Noam Chomsky.

We manage through a model that we hold in our heads about how things work ‘out there’. If our model does not have Requisite Variety, then we ought to incorporate learning circuits that will enrich it. But if we are ideologically attached to our model, so that it is not negotiable, then it becomes a dysfunctional paradigm.

-- Stafford Beer

Habitually and radically question the nature of your reality. Be in control of the inputs to your mind to help maximize your autonomy (whatever kinds and versions you do possess). Truly engage in critical reasoning. Hyperread reality for relevance. Become an expert at refactoring your perceptions of the world. 

Ultimately, [[h0p3]], as the zeroth axiom, must still be subject to audits, revision, engineering, restructuring, and programmatic change. Of course, I realize the Paradox of Tolerance must somehow be reconsidered carefully in the Question Everything approach. It is a dangerous axiom to hold; not everyone can live that way (although, the world would be a better place for it).
