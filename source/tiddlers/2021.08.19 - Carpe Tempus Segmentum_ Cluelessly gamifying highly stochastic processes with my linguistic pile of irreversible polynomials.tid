title: 2021.08.19 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Cluelessly gamifying highly stochastic processes with my linguistic pile of irreversible polynomials

Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Fruit. Syu reboot (took me a while to figure out that it was a blanket touching the wireless keyboard that was interfering with The Das (retard as usual).<<ref "f">> [[TTTOTW]]. Took a shit. [[TTTOTW]]. Indian food leftovers. Sleep by 5?

Woke at 11:30. Lucid dreaming! Neat. Mine are not rich like what I experience in waking life, not even my internal dialogues are as vivid. I'm a wild animal, maybe sanic. Meditation. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]] Fireman Time! Cleaning.

//The Walk// with my offspring was harsher than usual. Basically, no schoolwork done. I was handed my get-out-jail-free cards (tyvm), vapelyfe, and we examined why we must learn and what it means to spend our leisure time well (the [[gfwiwcgws]]) yet again. Deep, tightly knit rabbitholes recurring. We met neighborhood Joe again. He was recently laid off, still grinding oddjobs. Lost his new phone, feels like he's responsible for fixing mistakes of others too often. My daughter spent a lot of time trying to derail, and she failed. Not today, love. Also, suggested New Interpreter's walkthrough. 

Down to the [[The Den]] to work. He's on the VM. //Foundation and Empire// @ 02:43:28. I was pulled over many times for A/B testing and seeking direction (good). It's as busy as can be, but it works.  

She came down to read. I continued to argue with my daughter that she should have at least two teachers, probably one in digital art, and one in either philosophy, math, or computing, that could eventually write her a letter of recommendation for school. Obviously, I know where I think she is most skilled, where it would be easiest to accrue said letters. This cannot be my choice though, and she must want it. [[TTTOTW]].

//Skintime//. Minimal talking. She's exhausted. Stop talking, just hold. Applied pressure on her head for the migraine until she fell asleep. It's been raining too. Also, she may be a lay leader soon enough, and that makes sense.

[[Family Gathering]]. Leftovers (the Indian feast will not last long), fizzy water, and dark chocolates. The final episode of //Arrested Development//. She stayed down with me, some exercise with //The Office//, then //Skintime//. She's so drowsy. This sucks (well, holding her was the best part of the day*...that didn't suck, but she's not doing well enough).

Sleep by 9?
