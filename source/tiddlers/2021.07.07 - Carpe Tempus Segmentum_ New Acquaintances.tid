title: 2021.07.07 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: New Acquaintances

Woke at 2:20. Slept like champion. Feel like lazors. Took my shit, [[Morning Routine]], watermelon, [[TTTOTW]]. Ranga spending time with me (I think he's bored).

Local-[[FTO]]. `/smh` overall, odds look worse and worse. If they have any self-awareness, it becomes clearer that they don't intend to share their lives; they prefer masked conservative vanilla hedonism. Yeah, sure: I can play along. The gap is huge. I might be forced to simply target Yaleys, neckbeards, and hacker groups. In the end, maybe the goal is just to be useful and to stop looking for [[intimacy]] with new folks. That said, met a person, quite antsy, maybe there we can connect. They like to blog, so that's a good start.

[[TTTOTW]]. These beads are a lifesaver. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]+LolVods.

Hugs'n'bugs. When she has to use the AC, it hurts her sleep. Never did overcome my snoring, so odds aren't good on the AC front (one can [[hope]]). Day before, the doctor's office scheduled her appointment for her. Glad the time fits nicely, and she's dressing for the occasion (somewhere between bumblebee and 1920's black and white checkers). Like pulling teeth to get people to listen, and I hope they listen to her. Day looks clean for her, and my goal is to give her extra space today. Maybe 20 minutes and [[Family Gathering]], but I think she could use more vegg.

Prepped for dinner. [[TTTOTW]].

Hugs'n'bugs. Assignments and clarifications. Son like geography like only an autist can pick up. Encouragement. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Letting my feet sit in hot, bubbly water trying to get that heel healed.

Dialecture. Tense, standing in the pocket with me, seeking cognition, thinking about truthfulness, consequences, and predictions. Handing my usual opinions and advice. It might be hell facing my ad hominem, but at least we have snacks.

[[TTTOTW]]. She came down, stunning hippie dress she picked up for 3 bucks. Kept talking until the doctor eventually recognized that my wife was being honest, was knowledgeable, was worth listening to, there was something actionable. There's treatments she may get to try that doctors haven't been willing to try or that insurance wasn't willing to cover. We are a step closer. It went really well (doctor says she is "well developed and nourished" [aww yeah]). Invited me to walk. Well, shit, yeah.

//The Walk// was hot but good. I needed it. She had her 1-on-1 with her boss' boss (L5) who is temporarily filling in as boss until both positions have be replaced (confirmation on why, and it's morbidly hilarious in a way...the reasoning makes sense when you squint). Grooming for SZ's position it appears, and I agree (especially as it may become even more relevant for the possible jump to L5 if she wishes to climb). MDiv ball begins to roll (which is fucking __sick__!!! - I'm positively jelly). Somehow I came up, and as it cannot be described without experiencing it, she revealed this ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî± and some basic ideas about it (immediately understood several concepts about [[PSM]] that I seem to have difficulty convincing others about). `/wave`.<<ref "i">> I'm always down to [[talk|Contact]] ([[anonymous]]ly if you prefer), if you ever have need of speaking with a basement-dweller. 

She came down to chill with me in [[The Den]] because it's nice down here. I still need to sleep, but I'm gonna wait. [[TTTOTW]].

Helped my offspring finish the meal up. [[Family Gathering]] sans [[5c0ut]]@work. Couple episodes of //Arrested Development// (starting S2). Shredded BBQ-style Mole chicken, chopped toppings, watermelon, water. We...should make that again. Me like. Chill time for everyone.

As usual, I fell asleep.
