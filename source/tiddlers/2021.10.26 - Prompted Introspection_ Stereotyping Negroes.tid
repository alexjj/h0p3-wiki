title: 2021.10.26 - Prompted Introspection: Stereotyping Negroes

//I assure you that my Nth black friend, Jihad, gave me the N-word pass here.//

!! Which stereotype is actually pretty accurate?

`/squint`.<<ref "m">>

Compared to lighter-skinned humans, darker-skinned humans have more melanin in their skin, tend to absorb light more effectively, have greater protection against sunburns, may suffer from fewer melanomas but higher heat loads in warm climates (with hindered Vitamin D synthesis to boot), have a skintone closer to the initial evolutionary loss of body hair in our species, and they look significantly better in very bright and light clothing (that contrast is hawt). Stereotypes are models, right?<<ref "r">> There are a number of accurate predictions we can make in various contexts. Reasoning carefully about probability, at least in some respects, is not our forte as a species. Even the ability to make accurate predictions is not an indication of causal analysis either, and I think understanding //why// is what we're really after here.

Do you mean to ask which kinds of models are considered unfair to believe or wrong to promote, despite their accuracy? Or, even, that they are fair because they are accurate, even if it is a faux pas to express them? Are you asking about places where I think the crowd is wrong? What I've said so far isn't a highly disputed set of facts in some circles, but I bet if you polled every person on the planet, you might find at least one of these claims to be unknown or controversial. At the very least, I've provided a classic stage in which stereotyping can be deeply problematic, even if the underlying empirical mechanism can have merit.

Not good enough? Aight. Most black people I've known (not just African Americans) like fried chicken and watermelon (quite understandably: [[h0p3: Top 10's]]<<ref "i">>). Coming from a heavy potluck background, I can relate. In fact, as a PK, it's exceptionally [[salient]]. Most of us grew up in poverty, and that's some magic food to me. While I'm generalizing: most black people sitting down to have a conversation with me wouldn't have a problem with me saying these things to, in front of, or about them. We have bigger worries than this shit.

Next up, I'll marshal an argument about Dangerous Female Asian 1st and 2nd Generation Drivers and the cultures that enable them (and, I've way more experience than most any of you with this). Blah blah blah.
