title: 2020.11.13 - Prompted Introspection: Head Cold

!! Describe (in a creative way) how you feel when you have a head cold.

I hope I'm asleep when I have a cold. I have a hard time sleeping as it is, but a cold makes it even harder for me. My respiratory system has never functioned well enough, and I'm extra sensitive. My goal is to ignore everything except my screen when I have a cold. I don't want milk when I have a cold because it mixes with my snot and crawls through my face. This triggers memories of spoiled milk, and I feel the need to vomit. That hurts my head.
