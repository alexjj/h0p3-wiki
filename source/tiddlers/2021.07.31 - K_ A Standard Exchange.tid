Hope you’re having a lovely [[REDACTED]] so far! ^_^
Thank you. =)
It's been a good one.
How have you been?
Tired. Fall is starting to take shape and I’m ready in some ways and vastly underprepared in others lol.
Yes, sir.
Which parts do you feel ready for?
I’m ready for the idea of being in the classroom. I’m unprepared for all the paperwork I’m gonna have to do to graduate. Also-getting up early sucks.
How much paperwork is there? I'm surprised to hear that.
I assume with the state of KY.
There are several things I need to apply for, and two more PRAXIS tests I was unaware of until yesterday. So that’s fun haha
=/. That sucks.
Doable though.
How early will you need to get up?
Will you and [[L]] be able to match your schedules nicely?
I’m gonna have to get up at six and leave by 6:30-6:45 at the latest I think. And probably! [[L]] gets up early well so she’s going to help me as best she can. I get off school at 2:30 and will be working at the library MWTHF from 3-5 to coincide with her work schedule.
Noice.
I must be confused about the library position.
Still, very cool.
You're almost done with the process.
I’m just gonna go in for a couple hours after student teaching to stay busy and have a little money haha.
Yes, sir. That makes good sense.
How's your computing going?
Going well! It’s been an invaluable tool. Still hoping we can get the card upgraded eventually, but all in due time. :) what have you all been up to?
True. All in due time. It's like a Ship of Theseus, few planks here and there.
I'm doing my usual. Reading and writing. Today I'm going through music.
It's been a long time since I went through it carefully.
Are you cutting a lot of it or just making room for some new treasures?
I do not know yet. I'm working top to bottom. There is a chance that it will be an even split. Last time, I lost size (which is unfortunate, I'm trying to get to 10GB of music).
