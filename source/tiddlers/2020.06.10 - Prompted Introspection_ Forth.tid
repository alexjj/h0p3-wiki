title: 2020.06.10 - Prompted Introspection: Forth

!! What artistic tools, musical instruments, or devices do you wish you could use or play?

The slope from [[2018.01.20 - Prompted Introspection Log: Musical Instruments]] to [[2019.03.24 - Prompted Introspection: Bone Flute]] is so steep there's too little to say. The question should be salvaged. Unfortunately, I cannot define [[Art]], [[Aesthetic]], or [[The Beautiful]] well enough, and that makes my own question difficult to answer. 

I see [[Beauty]] in many things. Being an excellent and elegantly efficient budgeter who can squeeze maximum justified pleasure from the window of resources available is surely both an art and a science. Lifehacking surely is a composition of many tools. It's not about being a virtuoso of a single one in many cases. The low-hanging fruit butterzone is where I aim for even with my tools usually. 

[[chameleon]]'s exploration of Forth is a great example of an art I wish I could do. It feels like a philosophical computing language. I can imagine that such a thing would be incredibly useful in some cases too. In a high-level language like Python (still my favorite, ofc), I don't have to understand almost anything, lol. Forth seems especially gorgeous in its demands. Forth encourages you to understand the entire run-time. I also like procedural languages, the emphasis on extending the language (really writing your own language and program), having that bootstrappy dynamic incremental interpreter+compiler shell, the celebration of self-hosting and touching the bare-metal, urging a simplicity (bordering on optimization, that tight code pussy) on the stack (maybe Forth is like sculpting; I'm simply too ignorant to know), thinking in phrases of words, and it seems (when you squint your eyes) to have plenty in common with the wiki (as though we each are building and factoring our own dialect, struggling to pick out the right names for our words). 

One of the greatest virtues of empirical intelligence is the compression and [[antipleonasm]]ification of larger models into smaller abstractions. Forth might be esoteric in some contexts, but because it does not waste, it fits in the tiniest of places. There is always room for such an elegantly exotic thing. It seems impossible to master and a hacker's language if I ever saw one. In a world where we just throw more hardware at the problem, Forth sexily pushes in the harder direction by demanding such complete understanding that it grants complete control as a by-product. Part of me thinks that a lifelong personal dialect of Forth could grow into something outrageous, perfectly customized, and radically portable.
