Just as I'm looking at how you aim to reason about [[justice]] for your enemies: I'm looking to see if you surround yourself with people who agree with you, and why. I'm hunting for covert dark-triadicism in your tribal motivations.

Sir [[DeathOfRobinhood]] leads me to 3%, and Sir [[JRE]] to .003%. Maybe bimodal, maybe [[Saint Plato]] is correct about an inescapable political structure, even into ideality.

One of my problems with those who claim to be opposed to essentialism is often in virtue of how they choose to be dishonest in their storytelling.

I wish I knew more people who journaled. I'd like to know how many of them get lost in the words, reliving it, asking themselves if they've captured the essence well enough. Might just be an autistic thing at some level.

I do have a prima facie [[FO]] obligation to try to be heard, but at some point, it is no longer my obligation to complete the process of [[sharing]], including the appearance of defection. I [[hope]] to be robustly, hedged-conservatively fair about it. //That// patience is part of the classic definition of [[Love]].
