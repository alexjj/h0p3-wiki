title: 2022.02.15 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Muh peeps

Woke at 6. Meditation. //Skintime// with my sympaticon. 

She's up! Chilled with mi amor for a while. Making more progress toward letting my daughter go as an adult now. Reading week seems like a reasonable break. I think she's going to miss having class no matter what. She lights up talking about it. Probably the best part of her day, imho.

//Skintime// with my sympaticon. She's sleepy. Doesn't sound like she got much at all last night. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]... 

My sympaticon made breakfast, including for us. //Skintime// + eggs + toast + mandarins + tea + //ATLA//. Eventually, I could not keep my eyes open.

Hard dadnap.

Woke at 1:30. Meditation. Hugs'n'bugs. [[ASK]] is working on cookies. [[1uxb0x]] came down to grind. [[TTTOTW]], cleaning, and organizing. 

[[JRE]] called. Thinking about #adulting for [[j3d1h]]. I think he's in agreement, and few know our story as well as he does. [[Rb]] is considering work again, and he knows I'm in agreement with him. I will continue to argue that he must protect the precious few hours he'll have with her each day, but I say nothing new to my brother (probably basically ever at this point*). Regardless, she enjoys working in databases a lot, and so we thought about positions she might enjoy.

Massage for mi amor. This table might be beat up, but it works. I got the room as toasty as it would be with two small electric heaters (and the oil too). Did what I could for her. She needs muscle relaxers, and she needs to know what's safe even without prescription. I've noticed that I've been falling asleep without sound or [[vidya]] on the screen, and quickly at that. My life is changing here. I am looking for a way to accomplish the same for her. 

[[JRE]] called again. His phone died in a hilarious spot. We had been in a deep dive into philosophy (it's graduate level analytic epistemology and metaethics the entire time with him at this point, though more intuitive and personal...which, he can do with informal training because he's officially got that 135+ IQ [whatever that means], etc.). Same problem, different day. =D. Talked about [[friendship]], people we've known for decades, loneliness, and aging. He's noted how I've changed here. `/nod`. He thanked me for comfortably standing with him during our [[silence]]s. As always, I will continue to argue for the existence of divinity [[itself]], whatever it means.

Finished the massage (was talking to my bro while dropping the bow into muh hoe). //Skintime//. She's exhausted, but better.

Sous chef to my sympaticon. I was less useful today, and she had much of it already well underway. [[Shared]] our dranks, hugs'n'bugs, and planned.

My son has been wearing my clothes, my shirts in particular. I guess they are ours or his now, as, no doubt, they look much better on him. We have matching shoes now too. That poor human. Thank goddess he's wildly sweeter than I am.

//Skintime// with mi amor. Downstairs, [[TTTOTW]] with her reading, stacked in blankets. It's cold AF down here, yet again. We need to find something she'll feel comfortable taking scalding hot baths in (too many terrors from childhood, unfortunately) for her back and neck (as her doctors have prescribed for who knows how long, woman???? :P). Oh, she denies it is the best part of her day. 

[[Family Gathering]]. Kielbasa, roasted potatoes, cabbage, carrots, and onions. The tits. We watched 13 starts treatment.episode of //House//. Chill AF.

Put folks to bed. [[TTTOTW]]. 

Massage for my sympaticon. My hands are worn out now. May she sleep.

I was toast by 10.
