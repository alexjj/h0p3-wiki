title: 2021.08.17 - Prompted Introspection: Pick A Number

!! You must pick a number right now and live that many years total, in good physical health. You can't die before, and you can't extend after. How many years do you choose to live?

There's too much embedded in this gift Lady Melisandre. Obviously, I could be chained up in the desert, miserable, going insaner, etc. Not all lives are worth living, for a number of reasons. There appear to be some very interesting hacks in here. You're telling me I cannot be in bad "physical" health, right? You're telling me I can't drown, right? I become pseudo-invincible in some cases. As long as that power is secret, it might allow me to turn the tide as a 1-man army. I do not know the answer, m'theydy.

Part of me wants to go full Saint Daneel (or beyond), but I don't want to live longer than my wife (and the moment my son is 25 [barring other side constraints, yadda yadda, etc. etc., sniffle sniffle, and so forth and so on] I refuse to live longer than she does). Still bettin' on 14 years left for myself (though less confident). My wife predicts she has 45 years left given the longevity in her family tree (that's a non-trivial argument), but I think her health is consistently worse than said family members (though she has way more resources than all but the psychopathic Romani line, her Goebbels line [yes, that one] more Mountain mystic white witches, retard-savants, and drunks than anything else). I'm less optimistic (you are surprised), and I would bet 30-35 is closer to the mark. I'll take 30 years, please (sorry [[kicks]]).
