title: 2020.07.09 - Prompted Introspection: A Year Later

!! How is your life different now from just a year ago?

Despite my poor answers in [[2017.11.20 - Prompted Introspection Log: A Year Ago]] and [[2018.02.12 - Prompted Introspection Log: Year Ago Differences]], this question stands out to me. I wish I had answered it in 2019, and that makes me think it should be worked into [[yearly.tmpl]]. 

The [[Yearly Cross-section]] can be more than a tool for appreciating The Worm in segments, aiding [[The Remodeling]] habit, and providing a simple catch-up mechanic for someone interested in trawling through this hypertext in a year. There are other [[CDR]]s that can emerge. This [[prompt]] is something I could attempt to chain together. I'm slow to add more to my plate though. There are a billion directions to run full speed.

I'm not going to be able to squeeze down all the differences. I barely even captured a semblance of the differences on a day-to-day basis in this wiki.

It's fair to say I had a busy day last year. //Stranger Things//, [[AIoutopIA]] exploration, philosophy, maintaining a functional home, tending to my wife who has been feeling bad, proto-[[TW Canvassing]], Bob fucking me with NaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaNNaN, thinking about TW mechanics with [[bimlas]], and my offspring were visiting their uncle. Little did we know what the future held in store for us. I still feel like we are flying by the seat of our pants. 

By comparison, I had the luxury of taking it easy today. My projects are different. [[urban-survival.tdl]] and [[Homeschooling.tmpl]] are different. Slowly, my offspring develop more habits and independence, but it feels like a leap this year. 

The move to CT, my wife enjoys her job, I'm not working on something that makes any money and my vocation has become clearer (though I'm increasingly likely to fail), we eat better, CV19 and the crisis of capitalism is upon us, my brother [[AIR]] is with us again, I feel more at ease with my homies online, [[Family Time]] has blossomed further (I'm so grateful it's not pure hell every single Sunday with me), my offspring both grew taller than my wife (and they are going to be taller than me too), we feel less trapped despite being in the middle of a quarantine, my wife enjoys walking more, [[m16]] is my <3, I'm back to exercising far less, and a different kind of nightmare overtakes me (even in the middle of otherwise material bliss).
