title: 2020.11.15 - Wiki Review: Living Fart

* [[2020.11.14 - hyper/space: holding conversations without notifications]]
** I held my tongue in the meeting. Maybe they'll take a much closer look, perhaps even try practicing it to reach a conclusion (I doubt they will, but it would be nice). 
* [[2020.11.14 - Wiki Review: Moar Baka Brainworms]]
** My daughter has been reassuring me that she enjoys spending time with me.
* [[2020.11.14 - Prompted Introspection: No]]
** I am a living fart.
* [[2020.11.14 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: autismactivate.exe]]
** I feel like people so conveniently conflate incapacity with unwillingness. I know what that really means, folks. `/sigh`

** I think it could have been very useful for me to be able to speak at length. But, I also think that anyone interested in what I have to say can reach out to me personally whenever they want (and the wiki does a fuckton of work here too). I'm still not convinced that it's worth my time to do this. I'm often wrong though. I'll keep thinking about it. 
*** I have so many failures connecting with people that leaving the wiki to speak with almost anyone (excluding my [[Root Users]], obviously) seems unreasonable. This is schizo coping.
*** I could lead a session. I don't think the vast majority of people really care what I think in the [[end]] though. Most who like it seem to like the surface (I like the surface too), but the content is the real kicker.
