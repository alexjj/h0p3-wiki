How is your weeking going sir?
Jun 10 6:42pm
Sleeping very poorly so far, but it's been good.
Jun 10 6:42pm
How about you?
Jun 10 6:43pm
Sorry to hear about poor sleep. I had a bad stint of it when I first stopped taking kratom. But melatonin helped. As did Valium.
Jun 10 6:46pm
I'm OK. Always thinking of my next move. What comes next for [[T-Money]]. Status quo won't last more than a year I don't project.
Jun 10 6:48pm
You hustle in a way that only a truly poor boy knows how. I admire your tenacity (even if I despise that you've been put in that position).
Jun 10 6:49pm
It's good to have things to look forward too.
Jun 10 6:49pm
You able to make any progress on that boat?
Jun 10 6:49pm
Fixed the leak. But have had some emotional weekends. Not been productive so I haven't got it back together.
Jun 10 6:50pm
Better than I could do, lol.
Jun 10 6:50pm
Reading inspiration quotes at night to remind myself I'm not alone.
Jun 10 6:50pm
No sir, you aren't. And, you should not hesitate to call me.
Jun 10 6:51pm
You know all to well what depression can do. I'm to rational for bad decisions. But I suspect our mental health suffers.
Jun 10 6:52pm
Yup. Some days, we're doing good just to get out of bed.
Jun 10 6:54pm
Also, I was just reading some of our messages over the years. Popped up in my searches while finishing a letter to my old roommate at Berea.
Jun 10 6:55pm
I hate for my kid to see it. I hate for my wife to endure it. I hate that feeling. And seems like only substances can help me escape.
Jun 10 6:56pm
I hear that. Several times my offspring have found me just sitting on the floor sobbing.
Jun 10 6:58pm
I have sat on the couch or in bed all weekend or day and just watched mind numbing TV. I cry. But I've been conditioned not to.
Jun 10 6:59pm
Dad's aren't suppose to feel. That's why every grown man is so damn angry.
Jun 10 7:00pm
yeah, especially in the South
Jun 10 7:00pm
I often wonder if the military would have helped condition me to learn to be less. Anxious and more callous.
Jun 10 7:05pm
Maybe. You also have a conscience. Plenty of vets are fucked up afterward, especially with a conscience.
Jun 10 7:06pm
Yeah. Most days I want to kill my Conscience.
Jun 10 7:08pm
Yup. That's what it's like having one pretty often. Lol.
Jun 10 7:08pm
It's a like a woman on a constant period. Just bleeds! Hahah
Jun 10 7:08pm
What's up with your sleeping issues man? Any ideas? Anxiety?
Jun 10 7:09pm
No idea. 3 hours two days in a row.
Jun 10 7:09pm
Not feeling more anxious than usual, but it's common for me to have terrible sleep.
Jun 10 7:10pm
I did for years. All thru Berea and after. Even had nightmares about waking up late for a class or to finish a paper.
Jun 10 7:17pm
I eventually found something that helps/works for me. And it has been pretty consistent.
Jun 10 7:17pm
It's a combo. But the point of lights off no input is to try to solve mechanical, wood working, and project I have going on. Try to think of a new way to solve it. Even far off projects I haven't started. I just go thru the motions and processes. Tools, measurements. All the boring. Stuff.
Jun 10 7:20pm
I lose interest and pass out.
Jun 10 7:21pm
Sounds like a form of meditation
Jun 10 7:21pm
I actually picked it up from an old. Man. He said he did that. Picked one thing and thought about it from all directions when he drove long distances to figure out solutions.
Jun 10 7:21pm
I tried it driving and it made me wanna fall asleep.
Jun 10 7:22pm
Lol. So I switched it up.
Jun 10 7:22pm
Do you have the most trouble falling asleep. Or staying asleep?
Jun 10 7:33pm
I have sleep apnea because I'm fat. I wake up often, but I get back to sleep just fine usually. Not the past two days though. Getting to sleep is always hard though. My mind races. That's what it do.
Jun 10 7:34pm
I feel you on the mind racing. I had to develop a "dumb the pain process" I usually  lie I bed for a hour and watch a nature documentary. Then turn off TV and watch mindless videos with no audio on my phone. Then I can usually fall asleep.
Jun 10 7:36pm
Rick & Morty does it for me.
Jun 10 7:36pm
My lovely wife is asleep in 5 min after I start the nature documentary!
Jun 10 7:36pm
I'm jelly
Jun 10 7:36pm
Sometimes I'll. Let her fall asleep. And wake her up just cause I'm jealous. Lol. Not like scare here. Just push her and tell her she's evil. Haha
Jun 10 7:37pm
lol
Jun 10 7:40pm
At this point, my snoring is so loud that I purposely don't sleep in the same room with my wife when I can help it. She doesn't get to sleep too easily, and fights to get 6 hours even. My snoring is hell on her.
Jun 10 7:41pm
Plus, I work until 3-4 usually
Jun 10 7:41pm
Go get a cpap bro. I know we talked about this.
Jun 10 7:46pm
Aye. I could afford that now.
Jun 10 7:47pm
Next time I hit the doctor's office, I'll ask.
Jun 10 7:47pm
You just wanna pass away in your sleep
 Lol
Jun 10 7:47pm
Fuck yeah. Painless, hopefully.
Jun 10 7:47pm
Truth.  I'm not ready yet.
Jun 10 7:47pm
When I drink. I get a but of a risky death wish.
Jun 10 7:48pm
Lol
