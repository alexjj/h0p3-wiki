title: 2021.09.15 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Void Lurker

Woke at 1. Meditation. Chat with [[ASK]]. Their future is still uncertain and unstable, and understandably so. Attempting to befriend someone they hold dear, but it is up to their friend. `/wave`. If you're listening: I get why you jokingly say that avoiding speaking with people is your vocation. Good god, do I understand. Perhaps one day we will get to know each [[other]]. 

Lightning Struck.

She's up. Stole as many XOXOs as I was allowed. I'm no better than a puppy. =). She didn't get enough sleep, I can tell. Coffee will hit though, and she's back to afternoon tea. Class and PT (gonna have to cancel the last since the donors show up in our vicinity on Friday<<ref "i">>) to top it off. Time with her is gettin' squeezed hard.

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! Cleaning. Sleep by 9?

Woke at 3? [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

//The Walk// with my offspring was excellent. Daughter didn't do her work at all, but she did draw. She won't [[share]]. =(. [[Reggie]] guided us around, offered us more from his garden, showed us his work around the house (he's got a lot of leftovers from jobs over the decades), walked us through his conspiracy theories, talked about how he's been happy to get back into the band but no one else seems to be. My son continues to pull his double duty. I wish they would both go verbose. Welp, up to them. At least they had plenty to talk about. I'm the geezer who facilitates.

Came home to my wife studying Greek. She had prepared the blackboard for me, [[5c0ut]] and [[j3d1h]] attended class as well. I got to be her student as she taught. I am her retard. She's doing an excellent job. I'm throwing my questions and maymays at her (and she thankfully has some to throw at me ;P), not letting the tail go on some of them.<<ref "t">> She obviously had already asked some of these, hehe. So much to memorize, not enough general ruling rails to hold onto, and there's too many exceptions.<<ref "a">> Jesus. She has to digitize the spaced repetition process if she's going to casually maintain this at her desk for the decade(s) to come. Her department is excited that she's going the Greek route because they lack an expert in the resources of the time period and material. It would be a specialty that opens doors, if she wished; now I think the PhD might be more worthy (see how this goes, ofc; who knows what will happen?). 

Down to [[The Den]] with my offspring. They are grinding away. Laundry. [[TTTOTW]]. She's ready to order, and he claims to be done (I want to see the proof).

[[Family Gathering]] was excellent. //House// continues to make it rain. My son calls Wilson "Watson." [[5c0ut]] prepared massaman curry (been a long time; he didn't like it as much as I did), rice, and watermelon. It was dope. //Skintime//. I have somehow pulled a groin muscle, slightly. Discomfort is a fair word. People left, and she stayed to finish the //Project Runway// episode. I should have demanded //Raw Skintime//, but we were pretty fucking tired.

Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. 

[[Wrestling]] with [[ASK]] (so fearless in tackling their fears); they are climbing. They are telegraphing and scheduling future conversations for us. I feel like few people would appreciate their fragmented story of nested metaphors and suffering (to the point they have learned they cannot tell their story systematically to anyone because it generates unfitting reactions), but they possess a clarity in hard places.<<ref "r">> They have had to fight against everything with almost no support. We'll keep working at it. A Mormon-[[cult]] survivor who was never really alive until 37, where they finally found a person who listened without running away (not me [though I do], their friend*). It's clear they are re-reading what we've said, circumlocutory in a good way. I am their "void lurker," sounding-board, and backup conscience. They are my age, and even the old memes check out. It's a privilege to say "I love you" to each other. It's rare that to find [[gem]]s like these in the desert.

Sleep at midnight.

<<footnotes "i" "If you are reading this, [[SLT]], if either of you would, I assume it's you: the door is open. You can still walk through it. It's up to you if you want to participate in our lives like this. With [[gratitude]], I've since found other reasons to write, but I'm glad we still have this opportunity. It will always be proof in either direction. Every time you ask [[k0sh3k]], she's just gonna point you here. Come and [[wrestle]]. Come on, step right up: let's talk about Jesus Christ. I'll take you straight to him in [[The Great Human Conversation]]. You may even have Sir Brother [[DeathOfRobinhood]] as our mediator. I'm not even requiring you to make yours public (among your collection of documents, you've been using Evernote since it came out), and, any reader of this ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 knows that's a rare gift to you, and, further, you have the chance to speak [[anonymous]]ly with me (including a mixnet and my public accountability). You have every advantage, and more than you deserve. I'll walk the extra mile with you. I bet you can guess what my prediction is and why, of course.">>

<<footnotes "t" "Though she did her damnedest to ignore, overrule, and continue talking about other stories about the language. Magnificent.">>

<<footnotes "a" "And, I suppose I should apologize to anyone reading my gibberish. Lawd.">>

<<footnotes "r" "They utter the words that they are a hedonist, but I don't think they are. It's a defense against the crimes against their [[Humanity]]. We'll continue to peel the problem apart, as they obviously are strictly opposed to dark-triadicism. It's hard to appreciate the consequences of their claims.">>
