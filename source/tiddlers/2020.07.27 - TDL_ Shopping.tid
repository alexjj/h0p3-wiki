title: 2020.07.27 - TDL: Shopping

* We could do a big shopping or a small.
** You need fruits and veggies
* Brainstorm [[Whitelist Machines]]
** I am surprised to find what may be reason 2-in-1s. Unfortunately, only APU available. 
* Possibly bang.
* You may have a boatload of [[Antipleonasm]]s through which to sort. 
** I'm not convinced it's worth atomizing into 10 billion tiddlers. 
** Tables sound much better.
