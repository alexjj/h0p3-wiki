title: 2020.05.10 - Prompted Introspection: Simple Snakes

!! What is the best gift you've ever given someone? Why?

I'm enjoying the chains of introspection just as much as I did before in: [[2018.09.12 - Prompted Introspection: Gift and City Double Question]]. Perhaps if and when I have time, I'll be able to reference and tie more together. For now, I make simple snakes. You just roll them together with your hands - they're a cinch!

Speaking of simple Slytherin snakes, obviously, one of the greatest gifts that my wife has ever received was [[coming upon my worm, all pink, lank and warm|Poem: In Winter in my Room]]. Why? [[ITS]], I've taught her the true meaning of disgust and regret. [[As the head of the household|k0sh3k: Bible Verses 4U]], I've helped her realize the force of disutility my tiny, grotesque knob can generate. It's pretty amazing. I have no idea why she still touches it. I think it must be a ritual to remind her to laugh at evil. 

What gift would I like? I keep asking her to try many other snakes, but she's not into that. For the love of all that is holy, why can't I get cucked? I just want to watch from the closet in my spiderman costume. A man can {[[dream]]}, right? She's just so hawt, I want to see her fuck everything.
