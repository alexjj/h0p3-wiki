title: 2021.02.16 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Yup

Bro helped me with my wantons. Water method makes them too gooey for me, and I have a tendency to burn em. 

Late morning, [[TTTOTW]], LoL, Fireman Time! Slept hardcore in two sessions with [[TTTOTW]] in between.

Bugged offspring. Chilled some with my bro. His dress suits him. 

[[MTG]] with my son and daughter while we ate hummus, olives, and tomatoes. Son's Dredge vs MWC +4, open with Humility, tons of errors from him (not so easy when you are piloting), but that singleton enchantment is just broken. He's gonna get there. Daughter's Affinity +1 vs MWC, pukes her entire hand, I PtE in response to a clamp, and she plates and drops Ravager combo before I can stabilize. That +1 turn hurt. Son saw her mistakes; he's skilled on the outside.

A few games of pingpong with my bro. Thinking about the attic, the basement, and the kitchen with him. Also, that Δ⁸ company wants to send a carepackage. Cool. 

[[Fitness Routine]] with my offspring. They are making progress on their push-ups. I'm laying off my knee still, and my achilles area isn't right. Saw pix of when my son was two today (and my daughter maybe 4?), I'm holding his hand while walking/standing in the grass. I barely recognize my tiny babies. Also, rockin' my dadbod unchanged it seems, though I'm almost fully grey/white/silver now.

Offspring and I put together 6 large shelves and organized the garage. It's looking reasonable now. We'll be using at least two shelves for pantry/cooking supplies. My brother should have a kitchen worthy of his talent, and I'm going to try to make it the best one he's ever had at home. I'm still thinking about how to handle the toolshop (might just go super minimal). In any case, we have room to grow, and there's space to get surprising shit done. I think we should consider leaving the garbage cans outside. There's a good nook for it.

Sex. I've waited so long. Days. 48 hours is an eternity for the retarded. Feels like when I'm a kid watching time pass on the clock or the feeling of an entire day as a giant stretch. I will never be close enough. I'm so skinhungry, and she feeds herself to me. Given her migraine yesterday, it was exceptionally generous of her. I thanked her 5 times. Thank you again. <3. It was insane. Everything I had. Also, in addition to my constant inflammation from significant use, I burst blood vessels today. Small ones. Worth. Plus, [[naked]] shower with her, extra skintime. 

Working on rooms/machines with offspring. KMN. Come to Jesus moments with my son today. We'll get there. There is light at the end of the tunnel. Most adults can't do what I'm asking you to do. 

[[Family Gathering]] was [[awe]]some. Mardi Gras pancakes, two kinds, melon and berries, bacon and eggs. We actually played a game, //Cards Against Humanity//. Laughter, my wife turning bright red, lacking oxygen from infectious guffaws, she can't even. Unfortunately, my evil daughter is (a) just as skilled at telling awful stories with her cards, and (b) knows me so well she knows which ones I've picked most of the time, and she purposely tries to influence the game to make sure I lose (fuckin' cheater :P). We tied, so immediate sudden death round with the others judging. I lost. I'm hysterical about it. This can't be happening. One day, I think I will fade into the background as she takes the stage fully. It'll be my job to try to keep up. Lookin forward to it, kid.

Worked more with my offspring on their boxes. She's done everything right, and now I'm lost with her. Troubleshooting with her.

[[Contact]]ed [[DNelson]] by phone, e-mail, and publisher. You probably won't see this yet (or probably ever), but if and when you do: `/wave`. As usual, I demonstrate my insanity to people.
