I've decided your existence is a form of brigading. It's always a very likely story. You have disrupted another community according to our unchecked standards, and that, of course, cannot be faked either.

The proletariat who live paycheck to paycheck in buying goods now rather than investing in more stable means of production are not necessarily being short-sighted. They may, of course, be: unable to afford the price-efficiency of having wealth, lack sufficient income, follow monetarily incentivized inflation pressures, tacitly be preparing for the collapse of a system in a contradictory state, or even have learned that planning for any other future is nearly futile. It may be quite rational given the confidence intervals available to them.

If you aren't sacrificially pursuing democracy (in all forms of [[power]], including capital), you're bourgeois or reactionary. It is not, however, the case that the proletariat is conceptually compelled to pursue democracy (it is clear that many choose to do otherwise, and it is unclear why we should think any material conditions would guarantee that pursuit [though it may make it quite probably!]).
