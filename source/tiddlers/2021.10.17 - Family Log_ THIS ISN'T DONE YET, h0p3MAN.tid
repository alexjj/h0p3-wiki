* 1uxb0x
** I had fun playing the psaltery with you this week! 
** Thank you for being patient with explaining how you'd done your math problem and restructuring it my way. 
** It makes me happy that you are so deeply attached to your linux laptop, even in its broken state. Your pseudo-NUC is lookin' good.
** I'm happy that I fixed resilio sync.
** Your random interruptions (e.g. Generating Bees) are an absolute joy to receive.
* j3d1h
** I'm getting better at realistic character reactions. (Even though that's difficult without actually.. //being// them...)
** Thank you for giving some of your colored pencils to me! 
** Your Rust work looks very cool! 
** Your room is lookin' better, and I'm glad Minotaur is coming back online.
** Good work on accounting, and I'm glad you continue to work through the bureaucracy that is our healthcare system (I know it sucks).
** I'm happy that we can agree on systems of work.
* k0sh3k
** My labyrinth presentation went very well; I'm glad, I worked hard on that. 
** Thank you for helping me with the Lap Harp
** You walked with me this week, loser. It was amazing.
** We got lots of us time, including a date and watching a terrible show. Thank you for not spoiling it for me.
** Your outfits are always beautiful.
* h0p3
** It's hilarious that you sometimes scatter memes around in your prompted introspections.
** The table is very cool - good find! And good job fixing it up/working with the Boy to fix it up. 
** It's been cool talking Rust with you (even if you chatter for hours).
** Apparently, I like candy and hoard that shit now. I'm, like, way cool for it.
