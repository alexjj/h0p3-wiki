"""
[22.03.28 - 02:10:18] TAS_Helpbot: fikabot_@libera dadadies > <@fikabot:matrix.org> ​[[ASmith]]: again it appears you don't know, don't care or only wish to ignore and argue
[22.03.28 - 02:10:24] TAS_Helpbot: fikabot_@libera dadadies 
[22.03.28 - 02:10:31] TAS_Helpbot: fikabot_@libera dadadies Hey Smith, how has knowing any of these things you talk of, whether they are true or not, helped you? As long as american still have McDonald's and get to pay tax, especially to israel, i think most americans will be fine and happy and not care about the bill of rights or anything else too much really. And these people are quite happy.
[22.03.28 - 02:11:11] ​[[h0p3]]: Circus and bread, and that doesn't make most happy, nor should we think that just any sort of happiness is justified.
[22.03.28 - 02:11:33] ​[[ASmith]]: I wonder if Japanese Americans thought that as they were rounded up and locked up in containment centers during WW2, dadadies ?
[22.03.28 - 02:12:04] ​Gombye: ASmith: I may have seen something about censorship by social media. I do not support censorship by social media companies, but it is nothing new or out of the ordinary for them to be censoring things. It is not the same as government censorship, though.
[22.03.28 - 02:12:12] ​[[ASmith]]: I've seen a sad skyrocketing rise in Asian violence and fear in the Asian American communities due to Trump blaming China for Covid19
[22.03.28 - 02:12:30] ​[[h0p3]]: Most would prefer to ignore reality, in my experience. It's another thing to claim their preference to be blissfully ignorant is justified. 
[22.03.28 - 02:12:50] ​[[ASmith]]: on the contary, the USA Gov is instructing the warmongering diatribe echoed by the media outlets to a T
[22.03.28 - 02:13:05] TAS_Helpbot: fikabot_@libera dadadies No one really cared except the Japanese Americans.
[22.03.28 - 02:13:05] ​[[ASmith]]: apparently so h0p3 
[22.03.28 - 02:13:13] TAS_Helpbot: fikabot_@libera dadadies In fact, the more rights that are taken, the more happy people seem to be. As long as it doesn't directly effect them right away. Thats how america works.
[22.03.28 - 02:13:33] ​[[ASmith]]: that sounds rather brown-shirt isch, dadadies
[22.03.28 - 02:13:34] TAS_Helpbot: fikabot_@libera dadadies Darn im having message delays.
[22.03.28 - 02:14:55] ​[[ASmith]]: You think no one cared when the USA Gov on behalf of Israel whiped up Muslim phobia to such a height that Seiks were being hunted down, mistaken as muslims and violently beat
[22.03.28 - 02:16:00] ​[[h0p3]]: I'll grant you this, dadadies: most Americans are selfish egoists who don't really a fuck about anyone (and, ironically, not even their future selves).
[22.03.28 - 02:16:28] ​[[h0p3]]: Hyperindividualism, short-attention spans, immediate gratification, and a radical lack of empathy.
[22.03.28 - 02:16:33] ​[[ASmith]]: I call it a whole lotta bad karma, the bill is coming due
[22.03.28 - 02:17:03] ​[[ASmith]]: yes lots of lead poisoning, mostly deliberate by the USA Gov (leaded gas) leaded water pipes, and on and on
[22.03.28 - 02:17:32] ​Gombye: ASmith: When the US government do that? Trump suggested banning Muslims from the US, but at least Bush said that we should not blame Muslims.
[22.03.28 - 02:18:10] ​[[ASmith]]: such narcisists as the grifter family of Trumps getting into the highest office of the land speaks volumes how far the USA Gov has sunk
[22.03.28 - 02:19:54] ​[[ASmith]]: no secession, the survivors of the upcoming global war won't want any twisted zionist corrupted democracy ruled by the 1% wealthest cronics
[22.03.28 - 02:20:31] ​Gombye: Instead they will want authoritarian dictatorship?
[22.03.28 - 02:20:47] ​[[ASmith]]: perhaps feudal state's
[22.03.28 - 02:21:02] ​Gombye: And you think that that is a good thing?
[22.03.28 - 02:21:34] ​[[ASmith]]: such is far more localized, instead of the absurd USA Gov playing unilaterial global copper
[22.03.28 - 02:22:08] ​Gombye: So small-scale authoritarian dictatorship is what you want?
[22.03.28 - 02:22:38] ​[[ASmith]]: depends on how such smaller systems are governed and regulated
[22.03.28 - 02:22:47] ​Gombye: It seems like neither Putin or Xi want small-scale government.
[22.03.28 - 02:24:18] ​Gombye: Xi wants to assimilate the minority groups rather than give them independence.
[22.03.28 - 02:24:55] ​[[ASmith]]: perhaps you mean inside china?
[22.03.28 - 02:25:04] ​Gombye: Yes, within China, I mean.
[22.03.28 - 02:25:17] ​[[ASmith]]: which would be like granting the deep south to white supremists?
[22.03.28 - 02:25:33] * TAS_Helpbot sets channel limit to 28
[22.03.28 - 02:25:51] ​[[ASmith]]: how is USA a shining beacon on the hill of democracy you think or feel Gombye ?
[22.03.28 - 02:26:24] ​[[ASmith]]: 90% of 'the people' have very little say, 1% own some 95% of everything
[22.03.28 - 02:27:04] ​[[ASmith]]: Americans have outragious medical costs, tuition costs, cascading tiers of corrupt taxations
[22.03.28 - 02:27:16] ​[[ASmith]]: high mortality rates, high suicide rates
[22.03.28 - 02:27:26] ​[[ASmith]]: beacon on the hill?
[22.03.28 - 02:28:08] TAS_Helpbot: fikabot_@libera dadadies Sounds like he wants them to join the workforce.
[22.03.28 - 02:28:34] ​[[ASmith]]: Chinese leader Xi, you mean dadadies?
[22.03.28 - 02:29:53] ​Gombye: ASmith: I do not recall calling it anything like 'a shining beacon on the hill of democracy'. One area it is pretty good compared to most other countries is freedom of speech, though.
[22.03.28 - 02:29:59] ​[[ASmith]]: The ugyers education colleges certainly look highly modern and useful for ugyers that have very little education beyond fighting, jungle survival
[22.03.28 - 02:30:26] ​Gombye: '@ASmith Americans have outragious medical costs, tuition costs, cascading tiers of corrupt taxations' | What does any of that have to do with democracy?
[22.03.28 - 02:30:45] ​Gombye: I guess that you are saying if it was a true democracy, they would not have those things?
[22.03.28 - 02:30:55] ​[[ASmith]]: oh, freedom of speech you think is pretty good? Have you seen children beaten by cops after they used their free speech to sass the USA cops, Gombye?
[22.03.28 - 02:31:36] ​[[ASmith]]: photographing USA Pigs can result in being shot, being beaten, arrested, falsely charged
[22.03.28 - 02:32:18] ​[[ASmith]]: politicans often cite America is 'a shining beacon on the hill of democracy' for the world to see, I guess you've missed that in thousands of political speeches, Gombye 
[22.03.28 - 02:32:30] ​[[h0p3]]: Preach, yo! 
[22.03.28 - 02:33:19] ​Gombye: ASmith: Perhaps you should ask those politicians instead, then. That being said, the US is more democratic than many other countries (such as China).
[22.03.28 - 02:34:20] ​[[h0p3]]: The will of the people has little bearing on what laws are legislated, executed, and adjudicated. It's more democratic in name than it actually is. 
[22.03.28 - 02:34:27] ​[[ASmith]]: you think Politicans listen to the 90% or the 9% that pour $Billions into their pockets?
[22.03.28 - 02:35:03] ​[[ASmith]]: indeed h0p3 , JP Morgan stated he could buy any law he wanted to remove or be put into place
[22.03.28 - 02:35:10] ​[[h0p3]]: https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/mgilens/files/inequality_and_democratic_responsiveness.pdf
[22.03.28 - 02:35:12] ​Gombye: h0p3: There are many countries with even less democracy, though. 
[22.03.28 - 02:35:20] ​[[ASmith]]: and was very vocal about that, Zionist Bankers owned USA Politicans
[22.03.28 - 02:35:26] ​[[h0p3]]: I agree that some countries are even worse about the matter.
[22.03.28 - 02:35:43] ​[[h0p3]]: I'm simply not going to call the US power structures a democracy by any stretch of the imagination.
[22.03.28 - 02:36:04] ​[[ASmith]]: The USA Gov has repeatedly led widescale Gov Collapses and torture campaign's up and down south and latin america
[22.03.28 - 02:36:43] ​Gombye: ASmith: You seem much more willing to criticise the US than other countries.
[22.03.28 - 02:37:05] ​[[ASmith]]: and now the USA Gov, a serial human rights abuser and war criminal is attempting to label Russia's actions 'war criminal' and force Putin into igniting WW3
[22.03.28 - 02:37:34] ​Gombye: Putin's actions are pretty horrible, no matter how horrible actions of the US have been or are.
[22.03.28 - 02:37:36] ​[[ASmith]]: yes the fact is I was born and raised in USA makes me somewhat knowledgeable about that country Gombye 
[22.03.28 - 02:38:10] ​[[ASmith]]: The Genocide of Native Americans' 3 Million of them by USA, the mass genocide of all the Bison across North America just to starve them out
[22.03.28 - 02:38:11] ​[[h0p3]]: The most powerful nations deserve the most criticism, but more importantly, the most powerful transnational entities merit the most blame. 
[22.03.28 - 02:38:45] ​[[h0p3]]: Many of our enemies belong to no nation in the end.
[22.03.28 - 02:39:11] ​[[ASmith]]: The pouring millions of gallons of the worlds most deadly mutagenic chemical 2,4D Agent Orange across Vietnam and into its rice fields and water sheds knowing that deadly poison would poison millions of people
[22.03.28 - 02:39:48] ​[[ASmith]]: Vietnam never attacked the CIA communications ship, it was falsely blamed for that, it was factually North Korean sappers out of revenge for the Korean War
[22.03.28 - 02:40:19] ​[[ASmith]]: millions of gallons of Napalm on Vietnam villages, burning to death 100's of thousands of innocent civilians
[22.03.28 - 02:40:28] ​Gombye: ASmith: Okay, so you are in a better position to criticise the US, but you also seem very willing to try to downplay or just bring up downfalls of the US (past or present) when there is criticism of other countries.
[22.03.28 - 02:40:30] ​[[h0p3]]: Contemporary US imperialism is driven by interests of capitalists around the world.
[22.03.28 - 02:41:11] ​[[ASmith]]: In the Korean War all buildings 2 stories or higher were bombed, didn't matter if it was apartments, hospitals, etc.
[22.03.28 - 02:41:34] ​[[ASmith]]: English Imperialsm across Africa, Middle East, India was horrific
[22.03.28 - 02:41:51] ​[[h0p3]]: France and Germany fucked up big time too.
[22.03.28 - 02:41:52] ​[[ASmith]]: many of the evils today, were all spawned by that mass theft by England then
[22.03.28 - 02:42:12] ​[[ASmith]]: The French foreign legions still are very active in war crimes
[22.03.28 - 02:42:58] ​Gombye: ASmith: 'the mass genocide of all the Bison across North America' | Hopefully you try to avoid supporting the Holocaust-like treatment of non-human animals that is going on today.
[22.03.28 - 02:42:59] ​[[ASmith]]: no the USA comes out with Biden like a struting rooster claiming America cares one iota about foreign familys human rights?
[22.03.28 - 02:43:21] ​[[ASmith]]: State of Palestine childrens human rights? Yemeni childrens human rights?
[22.03.28 - 02:43:46] ​[[ASmith]]: who is supplying the cluster bombs to the Israeli's? USA
[22.03.28 - 02:44:12] ​[[h0p3]]: Do you think Biden's claims about food supply shocks is an attempt to justify entering a war more overtly? (The US food supply chain is relatively stable, subsidized as part of the national security)
[22.03.28 - 02:44:14] ​[[ASmith]]: all those 155mm artillery shells, some white phosphorus fired into extremely dense civilian populated Gaza
[22.03.28 - 02:44:59] ​[[ASmith]]: The US food supply chain is very fragile now, California is in extreme drought, its wells drying up after 8 yrs of constant global heating
[22.03.28 - 02:45:16] ​[[ASmith]]: the mid-west is beginning to be impacted by the global heating also
[22.03.28 - 02:45:24] ​[[ASmith]]: add the skyrocketing fuel costs
[22.03.28 - 02:45:40] ​[[ASmith]]: minus the organic grains from Russia, Ukraine
[22.03.28 - 02:45:52] ​[[h0p3]]: If the US stops exporting, making biofuels from corn, etc. The shocks, in the short-term, may be something that can be handled. I'll agree that long-term, including global warming, no one is in good shape.
[22.03.28 - 02:46:21] ​[[ASmith]]: minus the Palladium from Russia needed for silicon chips and to use as a cataylist for gasoline conversion
[22.03.28 - 02:47:03] ​[[ASmith]]: potable water is the next war, already the wicked zionists are using water from its stolen neighbors lands as a weapon
