We've both been thinking about [[money|https://twitter.com/ianpaulwright/status/1508112239584325643]] as [[debt|2022.03.24 - /b/]]. It's an old question. I feel the force of your argument, and I [[share]] that instinct. It may be somewhat misleading or incomplete, but not necessarily inaccurate. A careful and openly skeptical political Hohfeldian conceptual analysis of the norms and implicit or explicit rights and obligations clusters (which need not necessarily be typical either*), however, may show not only that money as a representative token of value is a type of debt, but perhaps unintuitively also the other direction (and, there I'd like to distinguish means from mere means). Are they really different enough? We may have to work harder to consider the other direction for either logical equivalence (which is where you don't want to go, but the ontological lines may still dissolve here). I'm only picking out that the boundaries aren't terribly strong ones. Perhaps we're at the "know it when I see it" and language "in practice" problems here. Though it may seem ad hoc at first, we can viably talk about an implicit scheduling and duration of the loan perceived in money, interest rates in the buying [[power]] of money, and even collateral as well. We might distinguish currency from money in terms of intrinsic value vs. representative liability or quantification of Praexologic actions, but that may have serious philosophical holes. We might prefer to talk about money as being more liquid and therefore not reducible, but we can imagine markets in which more standard contract loans are quite liquid as well (and may even conceivably act as a unit of account to measure economic wealth/income/activity/potential in some possible worlds). Maybe we're both forced to squint. The analogy may be weaker than we [[hope]], and it seems unlikely that we can generate a knock-down, drag-out argument that money doesn't confer sufficiently similar Hohfeldian rights and obligations as other loans.

In case you were waving to me (this is the second time you've brought it up), I am explicitly confirming (beyond winking) for you that I am intermittently following (as you can see, I must divide my retarded attention considerably). 

Oh, please don't apologize. Your work is dope AF, homie. I'm honored that my approval could even be retweetably maymay-worthy. I know it's very funny to be serious on the internet. I'm at your service, sir. I'm happy to wash your feet, annoint you with oil, and [[help]] you [[distribute some free literature|Masturbation]].

I cannot say we always agree, but you are dear, Ian Paul Wright, because you [[aim]] to speak sense to us. Though I don't predict it, I would very much like to see a collaboration between you, [[gwern]], and the folks at https://advancedresearch.github.io/ (they would all be lucky to know what you do). There is also a chance that [[benhylau]] would benefit from your instincts. You might be an outsider to some of these people, but I respect your work.

These may be all too obvious or stupid. I apologize. Don't waste your time either, please: What do you think of passive investment in the market? I have a redflag that I'm hoping you can either confirm or deny (or send me to one who you trust). What are your predictions and explanations for inflation we're seeing? Many of those in [[power]] in China and the US have publicly denounced stablecoins. How do you interpret that? Lastly, since you admire esotericism, what do you think of [[Strauss]] and the [[CCRU|Land of the CCRU]]?
