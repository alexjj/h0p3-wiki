title: 2021.09.23 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Thunderstorm

[[T-Money]] told me about his weekend. I finished up my [[CDR]]s. Gave my goodnight hugs to [[5c0ut]]. I should sleep. Sleep by 1ish? Took a bit.

Woke at 3:30. Because, of course. That makes sense.

Cleaning. Footbath + Vapelyfe + [[TTTOTW]] + trying to bring myself to watch the LEC. No.

1584. I laughed. Asked if she was reading ahead. Fuck no. Lol. C is meeting to discuss how she will delegate the special project. What's interesting is that the cataloging must be done by a CNT, and I think the job is difficult enough that I wouldn't trust most to do it well  (though S is obviously quite competent, her time must be protected, since she's already pulling 150% duty...wondering if we can push for another CNT for her, but I think that would be unlikely). Prepped for dinner.

Attempted sleep. Fail. Okay. Coffee it is. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Eventually, hit the sack by 11?

Woke at 3? It was enough. [[ASK]]ing.

//The Walk// with my offspring in the rain. I brought coffee too. Vapelyfe. My daughter bounced between subjects, but nothing clicked. She did walk us through a serious discussion of horror and terror. It was a major argument among we three. The card company e-mailed back with things they wanted fixed, and that gave way to new ideas. My daughter's thinking about doing square pixel foam on the edges, and maybe even letting it bubble into the rest of the card some. I do not understand their claims about resolution (and we've done this before), so she'll have to rework it. My son didn't have much to say about his schoolwork, but he was feeling good. Thought about scooters, travel arrangements in their futures, and all the topics. It was a rabbitholy day. =). I wish the walk was twice as long.<<ref "i">> Sent them off to prep and work on boxes.

Came home, can't find her, so she's downstairs! Studying Greek, ofc. She's now reading Greek symbols and translating straight into English, smooth-like. Classic phrases in philosophy mixed with simple time-period fitting sentences. That's gross. I'm jelly. Also, DMin makes more sense to me than the PhD. 

Lightning Struck.

//Raw Skintime//. SZ is onboard for the office. Always good to have someone else argue the point. May it be open and shut. Promised to get a small couch and mini-fridge if she gets it (I should map and plan the space myself, though her custom desk for shawties doesn't arrive for a couple months because of supply chain problems, ofc). An "Away" sign and turning the lights off would go a long way too. My opinion is that lunch should be used for napping, studying, or truly fucking around. You can eat while you work at a desk in a closed office (though she is more averse to this than I am). The last time she had her own, entirely to herself, was EBR in NO (hard to believe how long it has been). I think the current office could be used to house any remaining user services objects that needed to be in an office as well (that she didn't prefer in her own). My wife does a good job of easing the finicky sorts (like myself) into new policy (and, I think she's developing trust for it too). I said something actually stupid (a surprise to no one), and she tore my flesh with her hammed up delivery. //Inform the Men!// Held on for dear life. Meditation.

[[Family Gathering]] was dope. My offspring had prepared green beans (the canned, country, microwaved variety that hits the spot for me) and pulled pork on toast. Dark chocolate too. =). The Autobiographical Disability Teaching //House// episode. As usual, my wife knows how to explain the mechanics they used far better than I can. My offspring remember this episode clearly too (neat, that's uncommon); it's a standout. 

Lightning kept striking! A quick shower. Maybe a blood vessel burst, or something? I have a cut on my brow, and I have no idea where it came from. Thunder.
