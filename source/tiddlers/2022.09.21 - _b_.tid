Doubt those who imply or claim to be too young or incapable of either knowing evil or doing anything about it if they did know. Most self-infantilizing narcissists protecting their vulnerabilities are really just shirking their moral responsibilities. 

<br>

As a form of violence against the dignity of our personhood, moral anti-realism is (or persistent skeptical claims of ignorance functionally equivalent to even just agnosticism here are) the last refuge of the conveniently incompetent. Though we must extend the benefit of the doubt, way down deep (and against our own evidence) sometimes too, do not be tricked by ~~kind~~ nice covert narcissists who remain silent or display false epistemic humility on the topic: they simply don't want to admit they don't really give a fuck about anyone but themselves in the end (which is, at the very least, socially imprudent). It's not that they don't understand; it's that they want to understand. To their eyes, the remaining "best case scenario" is the dishonest disjunction between either there is no meaning or they conjure their own (and how dare you question that false dichotomy). They choose the abyss. You aren't real to them, nothing is, not even themselves, ironically.

AnD, i wIll Be WhO I wiLl BE!!]), how about you?

<br>

i'm bored, lonely, burned and burned-out by people, apathetic, self-absorbed, and wandering without hope, but: i also don't feel like doing what's right (especially if it feels performative [even trying to wear the mask of a good person would just be an "act" for an audience other than myself, and I care more about being authentically me for me, even if I'm evil, than being or becoming a good person] or requires further sacrifice), so i try not to care if i'm a bad person; it's all just subjective anyway, so even [[this sentence|ITS]] doesn't really "mean" anything (I'd rather choose to die or believe in nothing rather than face the fact that not only am I not the center of the universe, but there are perspectives that objectively matter more than mine in almost all contexts); so, i'm just here to eek it out and have fun in style before i die, not struggle for what really matters (so let's just do whatever we want to do, except when that makes me feel uncomfortable, ofc); as long as seeking hallucinated surface treasures while living only for myself in my safe spot feels real and pleasant enough at least sometimes (i mean, i care about self-awareness, but only insofar as it doesn't interfere with my privilege), i've sufficient reason to continue lying to myself about how nothing can really be done about the situation

Positive nihilism is a mere cope for nihilism.
