*** Pretty darn close. Not much I'd modify. 
*** [[P2P: Aether]] still doesn't have this right either.
**** I agree there is some kind of [[privacy]] that arises, but it's not the right sort in this case. I don't care for the reasons I can see. Wish I could funnel tax money into your project; the market will be extremely unlikely to give rise to the answer.

* Think About It
** https://caitlinjohnstone.substack.com/p/hmm-america-keeps-getting-attacked
*** Spirit of claim is probably correct. Anyone who doesn't actually think attacks of this magnitude are real and constant isn't being honest. Hard to find something to trust here though. I agree.

** https://www.troyhunt.com/humans-are-bad-at-urls-and-fonts-dont-matter/
*** I am wondering if changing fonts up there isn't actually part of the answer. Why not have those signals default in our browsers? I don't claim to be skilled here, but I think reading the url (sad about standalone hashes) is a practice that must be encouraged (even if that isn't what a company like Google wants [I want an enriched omnibar bar]). 

* Interesting

*** I can't even guess. If required, I think the initial response should be non-violent (there will places we must turn the other cheek in the short term...I do not know if the proudboys are going to do anything, but they might), but that is not something that can taken off the table (despite the obvious risks in escalation). That one must ramp carefully, and let us hope it need not ramp up at all.
