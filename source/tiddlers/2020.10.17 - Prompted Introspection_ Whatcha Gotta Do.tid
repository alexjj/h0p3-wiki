title: 2020.10.17 - Prompted Introspection: Whatcha Gotta Do

!! What do you do, even when you do not feel like it?

I'm doing it right now, Samwise. I'm trying to tell the story of my life, of the world, of what matters (and what doesn't). It can be exhausting, even terrifying, painful, etc. It's usually something I enjoy doing to some extent. There are often other things I'd rather be doing, of course. It's taken some discipline to try to work on this [[monster]] every day. Attempting to [[BAGD]] is another example. What's worth suffering for? When are my feelings simply not relevant enough in the calculation of what I ought to do? Perhaps this is part of maturing ([[WINTCIS]]).
