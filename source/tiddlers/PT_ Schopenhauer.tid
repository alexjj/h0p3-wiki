; 1788-1860 ; Arthur Schopenhauer

* Without time and space there can be no differentiation.
* The noumenal reality, without time and space, cannot consist of things; it is one thing.
* Causal connection can exist only within the phenomenal; noumena cannot cause phenomena
* Will and the bodily movements are the same events known in two different ways (from inside/outside)
* The purposeless energy, the unconscious impersonal 'will' that we see in the physical events is what noumenal is.
* In the phenomenal work, we seem to be separate but ultimately we are one in the noumenal.
* The basis of morality is compassion because we are one and we share in each other's sufferings
* The concept of a personal God is too anthropomorphic to be taken seriously.
* The concept of soul is useless; it supposes mind to be inseparably connected and yet independent of the organism.
* The empirical world seems to be independent of ourselves, but in fact it is all subject-dependant - an illusion.
* We should not be taken by the empirical world; we should renounce it.
* The end stage of philosophical understanding is the turning away of the human will from the world.
* We are slaves to our desire, never fully satisfied; existence is suffering
* We can only escape existential suffering through aesthetic contemplation or asceticism.
* Arts give us the experience of being taken out of time and space, out of ourselves.
* Music transcends the other arts in metaphysical significance.
