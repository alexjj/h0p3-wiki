//Part of my job is to convert what we are talking about into text. I'm taking notes. I know they are one-sided. Feel free to take notes with me here, eh?//

** I agree that your mispellings* convey mood sometimes.
*** Corruptions
** Your [[TDL]]s have so much in common over the years. What do you think the template has been?
*[[2020/06/10 -- Antipleonasm Analysis: Goat is the Real Prize!]]
** I think this is one of the interesting parts of having wikis like ours. We can still pull out the highlights, and multiple times in different contexts as well. There are many sculptures to cut from the marble slab.
*[[2020/06/10 -- Prompted Introspection: ShHshhsSHsHH]]
** Then we have evidence to believe it is alright. I agree to your last generalization though.
** This is such a hard problem. It's odd to see this pop up after my conversation with [[DeathOfRobinhood]]. Did you write this before or after the shouldersurf?
*** Wow. Neat.
*[[2020/06/10 -- Wiki Log: Many Much]]
** Learning the great myths and tropes of [[The Great Human Conversation]] will be ever useful to someone with your verbal talent and knowledge in philosophy. It's one of the reasons that you will need to listen so exceptionally carefully to your mother and fulfill her requirements in school. 
*** She goes way, way easier than I do in most places (I ask what feels like the impossible every minute of everyday), but you shouldn't take that slack for granted. Push the envelope in her work. You will be surprised what she has to show you.
*[[2020/06/10 -- Life Log]]
** I'd like to see you write this in your current [[CTS]] for today. Might as well jot the thoughts about what we're doing here, [[ITS]] if you wish, down as it is occurring, if you can.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** [[CAT-alog]] needs tagging. I think that was an excellent use of our time. Thinking about the cats together has been invaluable.
*** I'm okay with the fact that you kinda hated it.
**** I wish I knew how to draw that line of unjustified rambling down. It is a much harder problem than it looks.
** Being a friend, [[2019/06/11 -- Writing Log]], doesn't seem to get any easier in this regard. I simply find more layering. It is still quite rewarding.
*** Also, coincidentally, it seems tangential to your presentation on Epicurus today.
