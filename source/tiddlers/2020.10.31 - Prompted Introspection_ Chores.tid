title: 2020.10.31 - Prompted Introspection: Chores

!! Which household chores are you responsible for? Which do you hate doing? Which ones do you actually like?

These change from year to year for me. It's become quite different as my offspring age. My job is to make sure the house functions and that my offspring develop into flourishing adults. I offer help to folks, but most don't take me up on it (I'm literally that annoying). There are no chores that are exclusively mine, and there are no chores that I have no responsibility for except the daily cat related tasks. Overall organization of the house is my task; I construct the rooms, and I usually make the call when they aren't functioning well enough.

I don't like holding organic squishy refuse in my hands. I don't like anything that overwhelms me with a chemical smell. I hate chores that I consider mostly a vanity project. I like to sweep (and if my offspring would show me they can do it as well I can without being asked, I would take the job back from them because I enjoy gripping a pole and swinging it around). I like cleaning screens, the chalkboard, the whiteboard, etc. It's satisfying. 

We try to minimize chores a lot (I'd prefer we read instead), and I think we have lower cleanliness requirements than the average human being.
