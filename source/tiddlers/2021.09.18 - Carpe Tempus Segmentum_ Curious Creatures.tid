title: 2021.09.18 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Curious Creatures

Woke at 12:30. Heavy dreams. Meditation. PKM [[Anon]] spamming again, and I hope it will result in something useful. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]] + Footbath. Fireman Time! I will continue to make this weekend excellent. Vapelyfe + LEC Playoffs + [[TTTOTW]].

She came down. Got 4 hours of sleep. That whole "I think, therefore I don't sleep" problem. Angels, demons, and mediating hippos dream. We are all dreaming heavy in the past few days, it seems. Curious fucking creatures, these humans. 

Recounted /r/sluttyConfessions stories to her until she was disgusted with me. Like most girls who I've trapped in my [[Den]]geon, she literally ran out of the basement as I chased her naked (it is very rare that she runs for any reason); she was laughing because she knew I wasn't going to follow (next time I will tho).

One of the kitchen cabinet hinges basically came off (looks like one screw is stripped). Not sure how that happened. I can say it has happened before, but I would be surprised if anyone was putting their weight on it at this point. Dismounted. It holds all of our spices, and I'm kinda wondering if we actually want the door back on it. I kinda like it without (it's how I do my room anyway). What's the point of trying to hide it again? Just dust?

Woke at 4. [[5c0ut]] came down to tell me that there is a baby squirrel trapped in [[j3d1h]]'s room. Odds are good Ranga brought it in. `/sigh`. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. I had seasoned raw veggies (including a green tomato that hit the spot). [[5c0ut]] finished off curry for us. 

They arrived. Offspring decided to join me downstairs and tell me about their day. It was an excellent day. They essentially debriefed. Interesting to hear about their go-kart driving, as my son did what I do, and my daughter practiced literal driving (which I think is excellent too).<<ref "s">> They got some new clothes, played some putt-putt, and succeeded at an escape room (25% success rate on average). My daughter clearly has her own analysis of social events. I'm glad. I know they are in a difficult position, and I'm glad they come to it with openness. 

//Skintime// + //Project Runway//, more chatting than watching. I had some coffee we made this morning (it was still steaming out of the thermos: that's surprising to me...kinda insane how good that thing is at its job) + Vapelyfe. Squeezed her. I like the couch! Perhaps I will section off my sleeping area (it could be hidden, and if you weren't looking for it, you might believe the house was structured without it (attic has some interesting spots too). She is exhausted, but she won't allow herself to sleep as it will mean she will get nothing tonight. //Raw Skintime// + //Project Runway// (doesn't hurt  ;P) -> Assisted Fireman Time!

[[TTTOTW]]. Chat with [[ASK]]. Comparing notes on life and thinking more about their predicament. It's my job to make people cry sometimes. I end up saying less than they do (though still a lot), and I'm going to try to keep it that way (I already have a deluge of symbols), and it's their chance to digest and reveal theirs. They are a brilliant, quasi-feral person.
