** Wonderfully, we are at this place where I'm going to allow you to deliberately //mispell// words. You've earned it. It's like swearing. You can play act like you don't know when I'm reasonably assured that you know when you don't know (and act accordingly).
** Anxiety, eh? Yeah, we'll keep working at it. I also think you've come to recognize your anxiety and to constructively handle it. 
*** It's hard to teach that. Super important skill though.

** We'll have to find the right contexts for you to annoy your sister. =)

** Non-sequitur. It is unwise to flippantly claim "duh" when your argument sucks.
*** Your attitude doesn't fit the lack of understanding of the prompt.
** We've been here for a while. It's going to take some deliberate practice and adjustment. Try to answer the question plainly first. Charitably assume whatever you need to assume on behalf of your audience first. You can come back and give us your own definitions and snappy retorts after.
*** What should that plain answer look like here?
*** If the question doesn't apply to you directly, consider is a practice tool or environment for empathizing with how others feels and interpret the question and your context.
**** Tall ask of an autist, I realize. This is our duty, sir.

** I don't know what it was either. It's no fun when you annoy your dad either, lol.
** This is probably something to flesh out at the end of the night and when you wake up (during your [[Wiki Review]]. Try to enrich it, sir. This storytelling is more important than most people realize, and I say that as someone who fails pretty often.
*[[2020.04.30 – Antipleonasm Analysis: hehehe]]
** This isn't effective analysis. 
*** You open with a fine synopsis. I don't see a generalized attack on what is wrong with her claim. 
**** Charitably, I'm thinking you are using your example to show how to abuse her claim. You don't explain this well enough. I agree that something like this occurs (you can get us to your destination), but you've got gaps in your reasoning that your audience should not suffer. 
**** Generalizing the criticism would have enabled you to build a clearer bridge to the problematic example.
*[[The Lightning Thief: 8, draft 2]]
** You'll want to think about how you are drafting. Remember that your teachers are flawed, and remember that you are still the person responsible for getting it right in the end. The buck stops with you, bucko.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** Maybe you should attempt to combine your different areas of notes, tag them, unify their naming, etc.
*** Could be something you do way down the road.
*** I also think it's possible you'll want to start over and design from scratch at some point.
**** Though you should preserve this work, obviously. I go for a unifying strategy which most consider absurd. You'll have to make up your own mind (and, I suggest you can make reversible choices).
