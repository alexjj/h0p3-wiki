title: 2020.09.11 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: So Tired The Clown Just Laughed

* Woke at 8:30
** I'd like to thank my daughter, the world, and my dumb brain. 
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Deliriously watched Tiktoks and bullshit. Everything is funny when you are tired enough.
** I've decided none of them are staged, and everything is authentic. It's delightful.
* Tried reading, but it was beyond my usual blur of incomprehension.
* Laid down to rest...
* [[JRE]] Called
** Perhaps they will have a second. That he doesn't want another. Going through the system: they usually keep siblings together.
** We laughed a lot. It became like laughing at a funeral for me. 
** I am sad to hear that he may be strong-armed into it. He doesn't want to lose his son.
*** He's understandably not feelin' good, feeling pulled in opposing directions. 
** Wave3 response, meh.
* Nagged my offspring. Feels the same.
* Did get a nap in! Don't know how long...
* Chilled with my wife. Spoons. Thinking about her day.
** Refuses help on laundry.
* Cleaning
* My son is doing a better job of trying to figure it out himself and come to me with a frame or a map.
** That's something that has really changed over the past few years. I can only hope it grows and grows.
* Made dinner
* //The Boys//
** Muhfuckin' hotdogs, baked fries, strawberries, spicy pickles, and honey whiskey.
* VC [[DeathOfRobinhood]] 
** Just got back from a walk with Selah. She's been busy at work, tired today.
*** CV19 has been an important problem. 
*** Primary is physically as big as she is, and so that requires way more.
*** It's good that she's with her children again. She is the village.
** They continue to be hospitable, invitin' in people into their lives.
** His work is going really well. Even pullin' a "slow down" for his co-workers. Makes sense. 
*** He might be a director! 
** No swimming, just wading. Swimming once a year. I hear that.
** Saw a piece of art that was grey, white, and red, highly structured, abstract. 
** His dad was a craftsman. Man could woodwork, make fences, fix stuff around the house, and he was a welder too. Had a shop.
*** My brother regrets not having spent more time in respect. 
*** Father's stroke changed his mind about his son's future.
** Hank Hill
*** Idiocracy
** And, we wandered, a ton. 
*** His cartoon voice acting is excellent. 
* //The Boys//
** My wife is feeling antsy and annoyable. She needs sleep so badly.

* AFireman Time!
