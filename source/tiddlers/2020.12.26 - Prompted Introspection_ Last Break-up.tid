title: 2020.12.26 - Prompted Introspection: Last Break-up

!! What were the conditions of your last break-up?

What's a break-up exactly? How far do we want to take the analogy? Presumably, you are talking about breaking up with a significant other, but perhaps it's a broader question about any relationships. The answer tends to be similar:

//We drift apart.//

It's uncommon for there to be a dramatic end, and I'm thankful for that too, and that's perhaps part of why we would even drift. It's usually just a realization, an acknowledgement. That's something I try to catch early, if I can. It is painfully expensive, but I am [[grateful]] for the clarity. I would rather not live in a simulation, and I study the [[dok]] my relationships to other objects and subjects are represented, [[W5H]], and so forth and so on.

Sometimes we can put it back together into something new, and sometimes we can't. I have a responsibility to do that well, and I don't know how. I'm working on it.

That's one of my favorite parts of the [[ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱]]: someone can disconnect from my life for arbitrary lengths of time and still find their way back into my life with radical [[intimacy]] in a consistent, learnable, detailed, and deep way, and this can be achieved without even my knowledge of it in many respects. Less shame, more open acceptance, redemption (where necessary) has proof in the pudding, and it limits the [[wrestling]] that must occur quite a bit. It's a long-term tool for ebbs and flows of many [[dok]].

The Campfire metaphor of our social relationships might work here. A [[hyperconversation]] can be profoundly asynchronous, and it enables someone walking through my desert to see it change over time, to explore it as they see fitting in their context to some [[dok]], and to build or rebuild at what may be a more price-efficient and fair way of pacing. [[Sharing]] well is expensive, even when it is justified on both ends. There is a sawce to this kind of [[hyperconversation]] medium that I have found nowhere else.

Seeing the drift early provides preventative options and provides cheap ways to bind ourselves together in a way that might be locally expensive but as cheap as it gets globally.
