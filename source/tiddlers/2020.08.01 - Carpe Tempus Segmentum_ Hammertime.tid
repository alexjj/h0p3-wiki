title: 2020.08.01 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Hammertime

* Woke at 1
** Chasing and chaos in my dreams. Groggy still.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Tending to my wife. 
** She's doing better, but woozy. 
* Cleaning
* [[vidya]]s with the offspring
* Read+Write+Walk+Talk
* Pizza
* Dialectures
** I can't believe I'm still arguing about this.
* Read+Write
* I had enough with the day. 3 Shots of Vodka, and I was gone. Watched The Jim & Pam Show until I couldn't stay awake. Maybe fell asleep at 8? 
* Woke up at midnightish
** Solid sleep.
* [[T-Money]] was feeling lonely, so I called him up.
** Daughter and wife have traveled to see family. He's alone.
** Drinking
** Tool shopping
** Talked about our families
** Loneliness
** Dexter, Hell on Wheels
** Materialism
** Forest for the trees discussions of economics and politics
*** Fair Trade, Subsidies, and Regulation...
*** I laid into him multiple times for his dishonesty. I'm not going to accept evil moves.
*** I granted several times, however, that he does actually change his mind. There is a shift away from pure egoism in him.
** Said he doesn't read my wiki out of respect. Lol.
*** Also says he doesn't send his father-in-law here because he's afraid of what I'd say to the man even anonymously.
*** I explained that my job is to listen. If he wants to listen to me, he knows where to find me.
** His daughter can throw a punch
*** She's been reading a lot more. Dope.
** He's done reading books. I feel that pain.
** His family seems to be really glad to have him sleeping more and having more freetime at the house. He hates his status position loss, not feeling like a rockstar at work, socializing with new people, and he's hating having to be sober. 
*** He only kinda enjoys being with his family in some sense.
*** He still wants to quit his job, move back to making killing machines instead of lifesaving machines for the bourgeoisie.
**** He makes more money here too.
** Claims he can't use bliss, but he smokes often enough. Were I in his shoes, I'd just use. If that's really the thing holding him back, he might as well take the risk (it's not like it's a huge increase in the risk from what I can tell).
** Called ended at the same time my battery died. 4h phone conversation.
* Hit the sack at 5
