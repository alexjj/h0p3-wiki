title: 2021.12.03 - Prompted Introspection: A Memorable Dinner

!! Describe a memorable dinner. What did you eat? Did you eat at home or somewhere else?

One time, at the family-run seafood restaurant (they put our money to good use too, growing from a mere shack to something like a much fancier shack) with the best tom yum in the fucking world (I've had my fair share from fancier places, including [[Jop]]'s and [[5c0ut]] skilled hands who were both trained for it in Thailand), we had invited a Thai pastor's family to eat with us. 40% of the people couldn't get past the basics of conversation with another 40%, but we all enjoyed the meal. I don't remember the names of all the dishes, but definitely tons of shrimp in everything. A fish cooked in a salty green broth (as usual, it was a fish that [[j3d1h]] picked out of the tank, and she ate the eyeballs). There was extra lemon grass and garlic, mushrooms too. They knew to turn the heat up for us too, and the classic four Thai flavors were very strong. It was an insane meal. Unfortunately, in a sense, we ordered too much food. I'm all about bringing leftovers home, but, in this context, it was rude not to have eaten every last scrap of food on the entire table. We wouldn't offend the Thai sensibilities here, so our delight became a duty. It took us an extra half hour or so to complete the task, and you could tell everyone was actually in mild discomfort. Not much of a story, I suppose, but there was a surprising mix of emotions (I'm not terribly skilled at handling that).
