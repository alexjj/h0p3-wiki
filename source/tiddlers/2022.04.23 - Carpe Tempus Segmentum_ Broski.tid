[[TTTOTW]]. Sleep by 1? 

Woke at 9. Tons of dreams. Excellent sleep. //Skintime// with my sympaticon + planning. [[Morning Routine]]. [[TTTOTW]]. Lots of small chats. A while [[That's for you to decide]] appears...

Made and had grits and eggs with my sympaticon. No one else wanted any. Alrighty. //Community//. Chat with [[Variety Creepy]]. Assignments and negotiation with my daughter.

[[D2]]. Halfway through 91 on NeckRomancer. At 93, we'll begin gambling and crafting amulets. With the necromancer as the second, Aurora dies quite infrequently, and we'll probably be able to hit 50 million gold by 93.

More assignments. Life is different when I anticipate that people either aren't hearing or aren't listening. Simplified. I don't quit though.

//The Date// with mi amor. We went to a digital concert of Avi Kaplan (less talking, more music, plz). Much preferred over traveling for it. Almost went to NY for it. `/nod`.

Shopping @ W-Entity with my sympaticon. [[JRE]] called otw, as he was traveling (that's when he talks to me). [[ASK]] and I walked around the perimeter as he talked and I listened. A friend of his who he has mentioned a dozen times over the past decade is in trouble. She had to isolate much harder during quarantine for her SO, breakdown, and then he ghosted her for it. He's traveling a couple hours to see her, and she said she was going to talk to mi amor a while back but lost the info. She may have both of ours.<<ref "i">> There are few who can keep up with us, but she does. Thought about [[5c0ut]], and I have little to say, as usual. [[Bn]] is talking even more, but the state is no longer paying for his speech therapy (which wasn't obviously helping either). [[Q]] can blow bubbles and catch them with the wand (pretty good for his age). Boys had fevers this week, and they had to go to urgent care facilities. Having a hard time getting them to sleep, and feeling them terrible twos. [[Bn]] is extra mouthy, tellin' his dad to go away, etc. XD. He's defending a person he hates because he's doing what unions do: protecting workers. He wrote a letter for the foodchain, since many don't realize that the attack on this person he hates is actually an attack on all the workers. It's an expensive thing to do as a father, and this time there's traction. He talked more about Elden Ring and his belief that I'd be a master of it from dexterity and metagaming perspective, and he says I'm disappointed in the PvP of his games.

[[ASK]] and I picked up some odds and ends. Gonna go for junk food tonight and a special sammich tomorrow.

Met with Mitch. He didn't have a real argument (mi amor even began stifling a laugh during part of the re-pitch). 

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. //Inform the Men!// //Raw Skintime//. 

[[Garden]]ing with my sympaticon. My son is walking around with his voice recorder taking notes, talking to himself, planning his work. `/nod`. The young people didn't listen to me for the past 6 hours, and it's costing them now. Neighbor stopped by from the sportsball; teenager was into [[ASK]], according to her (I'm so blind I would have no idea). 

[[TTTOTW]].

[[Family Gathering]], impromptu. Pizza rolls. Smallpox episode of //House//. Immediately fell asleep, prolly 9.

<<footnotes "i" "My brother respects you, not just your personhood, but who you've chosen to be as a person, and that is quite rare (for either of us). If you ever read this, I have been thinking about you for a long time, madame. It is my honor. It's easy to be scared of me. You don't have to be (perhaps in time, you will appreciate why I must sometimes be terrifying). Also, fellow Berean here. `/high-5`.">>
