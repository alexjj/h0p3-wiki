title: 2021.10.10 - Family Log: why do you rich fucking white people insist on seeing every socio-political conflict through the myopic lens of your own self-actualization?

** Slept poorly. Got new multivitamins, so that's nice.
* k0sh3k
** I've had ups and downs in energy level and ability to remember things - mostly tied to whether or not I've forgotten to take my vitamin D in the morning. 
* h0p3
** Crawling out of my skin all week, temporarily a massive drop in libido, I've felt really off lately, dance is good. Still, good health. Also, got me a flu shot, so it will be impossible for me to get sick.

** I've had a blast working on the table with you. I think it's turning out pretty decent too. I'm glad to convert trash into treasure with you.
** I've had a blast working at the table with you. :) I've enjoyed spending time with you while we both do schoolwork; it makes schoolwork more fun for me, anyway. I hope you enjoy it, too. 
** I like the way you approached shopping at Burlington - you knew what you wanted to look for, and that's what you got. That's an excellent habit to develop. 
** I have recieved multiple compliments on how I make steak and porkchops.
** Thank you for indulging my TPoH, Deltarune, and other fandom-related rants.
* j3d1h
** My character/outfit designs have been getting both more practical and more interesting.
** Thank you for making excellent cornbread. We are all lucky when you bake. 
** You've been managing your emotions and finding sources of happiness more and more..... imho.
** I've enjoyed spending time with you while we both do schoolwork; it makes schoolwork more fun for me, anyway. I hope you enjoy it, too. 
** I really like going over Sunday homilies with you; you've gotten very good at picking out the strong and weak points and thinking about the message - both the message given and the message that should have been given. 
*** Strong enough that I enjoy thinking about even the hearsay of the argument. Plenty to wrestle with.
** I enjoy helping you with your computer problems.
* k0sh3k
** I'm very proud of my work on the labyrinth presentation for next Sunday. 
** Thank you for making coffee for all of us. It's really good coffee.
** Thank you for planning our outting, scheduling our shots, and going all over the place with us.
** You've become far more attuned to a lack of vitamin D. You remember just a few years ago? 
*** No. (Lol.)
**** See. Proof. =)
** You have enormous patience with your trolls (me, most of all), undergrads, and karens. You make the most of being with unbearable people. 
** Your daily meetings with the offspring have been useful to them, and I'm glad you've sacrificed for it. I think that is going to add up nicely for the remaining years we are responsible for raising them.
** You are skilled at coming up with paper topics, and I've enjoyed watching the synchronicity of parts lining up for you here. 
** I'm glad that you continue to schedule out-of-work meetings with people who don't show up or cancel. 
** Thank you for having us try out sunday school.
** Your puns are a perfect balance of clever and awful.
* h0p3

** I like playing games with you in the morning. But stop putting mustard in my bag. ;) 
*** What about ketchup?
**** No condiments of any sort, plzthxbye. 
***** no I've gotta get some thick no liquid in that bag. Maybe no small baggies, that way you can no sniff when you really need to no remember. I'll alawys be there no with you. no
** I did a good job raising a daughter who picks out salient quotes.
** You make some very intelligent friends.
