title: 2021.01.31 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Adulting

* Woke at 3
** Still feeling exhausted. The trip was bonkers. 
** Soothed myself through much of it by touching my parts. Not something I usually do since it is already ridiculously stimulating. Might as have pleasant things with the anxiety.
*** Also, my toys are everywhere in my room. One of the differences between family^^tm^^ and otherwise: they don't care. I know the feeling though. Definitely.
* Fireman Time!
** Extended. Had to take breaks. I'm so wired sensitive that I have to stop, overwhelmed. Weighted blanket is amazing.
* Brightened my day.
** Senpai [[chameleon]] contacted. Turned down again. 
* Try To Take Over The World 
** [[Dreamcloud]] contacted me, hit him back. 
** [[TW Canvassing]]
* Adults came to check with me. 
* Sandwiches
* Family went to Burlington Coat Factory.
** Aysia (completely fucking lived up to her stripper name, unless I'm missing a letter) was the cashier, 8/10 AZN (may have been 18 for all I know; I know who I'm introducing her to if I ever have the chance), braless, and she got along immediately with my brother (though, he points out that everyone does). I stuck around to give her my pseudonymous card for dinner or whatever, in case she wanted to get to know us. She quasi-giggled and thanked me.
* Dolla' Sto.
** 19-in-1 body/hair/soap/conditioner/etc. stocked up. Things my bro was missing.
* Took everyone home.
* Took my bro to another Burlington.
** He's in much better shape now.
* Cleanup
* //Skintime//
** Denied again. Still, 45 minutes of naked woman on me is heaven. Tomorrow. 
* Try To Take Over The World
* [[Family Time]] @ 5
