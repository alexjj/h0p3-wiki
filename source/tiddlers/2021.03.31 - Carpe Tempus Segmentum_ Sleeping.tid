title: 2021.03.31 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Sleeping

Wine + [[TTTOTW]] + Local-[[FTO]] (a continued nightmare, sifting through sand). I've been way more sedentary than usual lately. Not a hard push, also chips. =). Took the trash out, but I might have been late.

Slept hard. Dreams, but I can't remember. Woke, Ruminated, Fireman Time! Called [[JRE]] back. [[TTTOTW]], ⁸Δ⁸. [[Morning Routine]], 

Hugs'n'bugs. [[Scout]] seemed to be doing alright. He's been working on lots of projects, including his own shots and banking. My son may be trying harder, and my daughter is doing her thing.

Checking on more vaccination options. I'm sad that it might take quite a while, and I hope I'm wrong. The rest of us are going to have push through the options to find something.

//The Walk// in light rain. She doesn't like holding her umbrella with one hand, but I need to hold hands. You have to lead your retard around. Also, it's interesting that since her biodonor stole her diaries, she stopped keeping them for decades. I've seen her try many times. The wikis have clicked though. I regret not trying earlier, and I'm really glad that we do. Perhaps in a couple decades, we'll have a rhizome. We're lucky she has a job she adores because it would be awful if she didn't. Continued worrying about our daughter. 

//Skintime//, glorious, with a flash of my nanopenis to the neighbors. She fell asleep on top of me while I'm belly down. She's scared to take naps, but I'm glad she did. 

[[Family Gathering]] was interesting. Dragged everyone to the table. Made biscuits. Tried playing //Dominion//, 4-player, going Chapel.strat, my daughter quit, and that ended the game. Everyone had their own things to do at the table this round. [[Scout]], [[j3d1h]] and I drew on paper, I listened to music and Local-[[FTO]], my wife read and ate her eggs'n'noodles, and I played (and lost) a game of chess to my son. 

Nap in lap. I need to shop. Hugs'n'bugs with folks.

Recovered LoL accounts for my bruvnah. [[TTTOTW]].
