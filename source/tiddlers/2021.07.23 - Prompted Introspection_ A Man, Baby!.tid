title: 2021.07.23 - Prompted Introspection: A Man, Baby!

!! What relatively common experience have you never had?

I'm a really bad kisser (it's wet and my tongue cannot extend at all, according to [[k0sh3k]]), but I really like kissing. More than I know hao 2 explain. Anyway, I've never french-kissed a man. I've kissed my fair share of men, and I've kissed some on the lips too. I've never done so sexually though. It's not like I've not tried to be open to the experience, but it's not struck me. My conditioning and circumstances have made it unlikely, imho. Perhaps it's something that will change over time. I've seen myself change considerably over the decades. Maybe it will! I hope so. I think bi men are often well-positioned to have their desires sated. It's okay if I don't too. There's only so much that's in my [[power]] here. I did recently have a man ask to suck my cock (asked me to watch porn instead),<<ref "i">> but I want to kiss and cuddle the person who's going to do that (and the thought wasn't appealing to me). Girls are hawt, penises are hawt, but men are not to me. One can [[hope]] that I've enough plasticity left in the ol' donger.
