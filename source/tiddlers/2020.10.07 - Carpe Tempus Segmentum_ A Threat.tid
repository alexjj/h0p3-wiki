title: 2020.10.07 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: A Threat

I like the way I construct the cozy web. I aim for pieces of tech I respect, work my way down. I give a real entrance. Platonic guardians must have an accountability mechanism like transparency running deep in their processes. Sufficiently [[shared]] values is a hard problem.

* Read+Write+Walk+Talk
** Sadly, I don't think I'll have such a nice path in what may be our home.
* Fireman Time!
* Read+Write+Walk+Talk
* Attempted sleep by 7:30
** I have no idea what I got...
* Woke by Noon
* My daughter asked me if I wished to speak with a car that was outside waiting to speak with an adult. She said they (a mother and daughter) were going to call animal control about our cat Ranga. My wife was emerging from the house and dealt with them. She was unhappy with their poor reasoning and approach, obviously.
** As my daughter was bringing Ranga inside, the woman came outside without her mask to yell in my daughter's face, threatening to get her gun out and shoot it. My daughter de-escalated and handled the sociopath well enough.
** Oops. [[k0shiqua]] emerged. Her cat and especially her daughter (it's been a while since I've seen her that angry).
** Animal Control was called, and they said they are on our side. We're playing by the rules. Animal Control felt it best to lodge a complaint with the police. My wife asked for the police not to come, especially since the woman was a PoC (and there's no reason to make life harder on her, and no one wants the popo). 
*** Regardless, the house was cleaned and prepared for an encounter.
** Thought about the situation with my offspring, thinking about dignity and self-respect, considering what was so fucked up about what happened.
** We may only have a couple months left here. I didn't actually get to hear or see it. I'm not convinced the woman is dumb enough to fire her gun (though, I may be wrong). Poisoning the cat or running him over, that she might do.
*** I grew up hearing threats like this.  
* Read+Write+Walk+Talk
* Dialectures
* Prep for meal
* Wife came home, talked a bit, then she went over with [[j3d1h]] to speak with the other two women. Peace was the goal. It didn't go down well.
** Narcissistic territorial/status dispute. 
** This may escalate still. Hope we can avoid it. I'm proud of my wife for not being violent. I saw the hood in her again today.
* //The Walk//
** It rained, we had our umbrellas
** Boomered by Howard and Ellen. 
** She's feeling it today. Migraine on top.
** My wife is handling reference for practical theology, there's a book that she was interested in for homeschooling (after speaking with another homeschooler working through the system), and it's getting picked up. Neat. SZ is playing it right.
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Plaintains, chicken, rice/kimchi, squash and zucchini
*** Daughter nailed those plaintains. 
** //ATLA//

* Tried popping open 5k FF tabs. Probably looks like a DOS. 
** Found multiple failures in FF, including overflows into other windows while only opening 150. Jesus.

This was an unpredicted day. It was interesting to see my daughter know that what was occurring was so wrong and yet she handled it without taking it personally. Must have been a lot of emotion all at once. It's something she's going to need to reflect on. Interesting to see [[R]]'s response.
