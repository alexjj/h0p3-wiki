title: 2020.05.11 - Wiki Review: Rebuild Muscle

* [[Old Plans]]
** A [[PH]] for now. Still exploring this thing. Not sure what it should look like.
* [[2020.05.10 - Family Log: Chipmunk]]
** There are way more errors than usual here.
* [[2020.05.10 - Prompted Introspection: Simple Snakes]]
** Completed. Plenty of time for serious answers upon repeat. 
* [[2020.05.10 - TDL: Cleanup]]
** Reminds me, I should probably wake them up. We do have shit that has to get done today.
* [[2020.05.10 - Wiki Review: Toward Rest]]
** We have been pushing hard. We have to give muscles time to rest and rebuild.  
* [[2020.05.10 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Family]]
** I'm hoping that a week will allow us to push hard again. If this works, we may do so again before the end of the summer.
*** I am doubtful my son will do what he ought. He knows this is a test worth passing.
* [[2020.05.09 - ASmith: Pandemic]]
** I am lucky to connect with all sorts of people. It is my honor.
*** I aim to be useful to this nomad. I appreciate how generous they are with people too.
