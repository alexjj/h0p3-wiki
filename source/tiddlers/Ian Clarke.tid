** "Does dishonesty on the left or from the "deep-state" justify dishonesty from Trump and his supporters?"
** "It's an ideology derived from Marxism in which they've replaced class conflict with racial conflict. CRT is about as historical as Scientology is scientific."
*** "There is nothing wrong with studying Marxism as an ideology from a neutral perspective, but teaching Marxism as fact isn't education, it's indoctrination."
*** "CRT proponents are masters of language manipulation and hiding behind innocuous labels like 'antiracism'."
*** "As a religious minister I doubt MLK was a fan of Marxism, and thus I doubt he'd be a fan of CRT if he was around to see it."

This mayor had spent the previous several months pandering to those same violent left wing extremists while they rioted almost every night...That's not normal, and shouldn't be normalized."
*** "Why are grown adults so desperate to talk to other people's young children about homosexuality?...I don't think they're all desperate to have inappropriate conversations with children."
*** "Not sure who is making a mountain out of anything, I just think it's absurd that a literal serial killer can get journalists to rewrite their articles simply by declaring that they are of a different gender."
*** "Private businesses can set their own rules, but the charade of putting on a mask for 5 seconds while walking into city swimming pools is completely absurd."

** "I'm facing a headache with some options I was granted for a startup back in 2013 for being an advisor. I didn't exercise the options at the time (hindsight is 20-20)...The startup is doing well - it recently raised ~$300m at a ~$3b valuation, but my options expire in Dec 2023 and I'm growing increasingly concerned that they won't have a liquidity event before then...If I exercise my options before then it will be taxed as income which could leave me owing >$100k in taxes to the IRS - but if the company hasn't yet had a liquidity event then I can't sell the options to pay that."

** "I was fairly skeptical about OWS initially, but have grown more sympathetic to the emerging policy goals with time (get money out of politics, don't saddle students with a mortgages worth of debt before they're 23, etc)... If OWS make the police their enemy, they lose."
