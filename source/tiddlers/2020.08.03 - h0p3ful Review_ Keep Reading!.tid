** You have an opportunity to do this right. You should take it. None of us know how far you can go here.
*[[2020.08.02 – TDL: 7 and 1]]
** `/high-5`. Lurv it. Keep fleshing it out, sir.
*[[2020.08.02 – Prompted Introspection: You aren't a person in perfection.]]
** Oh. That is quite an argument. It is ancient. Here I must be quiet. I cannot answer. I ask you to think carefully again and again about the problem. You have a knack for landing on these classic problems, pulling them out of thin air. It's shocking to see. I want to know what Saint Kant would say.
*[[2020.08.02 – Carpe Diem: Book]]
** Hey, what did you read in bed? Was it the book your mom got you? Dope.
*** 9 books in 8 days. Why aren't you recording any of this in your wiki? Dude.
*[[2020.08.02 – Antipleonasm Analysis: Losing time.]]
** I adore the link. =)
** Recall that roughly half the sum total [[phenomenology]] of the passage of time in our species is consumed by the age of ~19. Every hour as a child is so novel that it accounts for many hours of an adult's ray of intentionality in terms of raw experience. Many people have a nostalgia for their lives as young persons. 
*** Saint Heraclitus said, "Time is a game played beautifully by children."

** =/. I wish you did the work she assigned. You are going to be kicking yourself for not doing it.
** Your mom and I were talking today about mathematics and other topics that we [[hope]] you'll dive into. You have such an opportunity here.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** I'm glad you made [[Dreams of 1uxb0x]]. It's not clear that you will want to use the [[APFVD]] structure I do (though I still see no way around it for myself). My assumption is that your wiki will have to change many times. 
*** Your mother and I were talking about this on our walk today. Presumably, 18 and 25 would both be ideal times to "reboot" a wiki. Perhaps you could do the same now if you wanted. 
*** If you need, you can simply house the tabs all in one for me and then build the sidebar however you wish (but, for now, you'll default to what we've got here).
** I don't care if you give me credit at all, btw (e.g. [[Linux Tool Collection]]). It does need tagging, but I think tagging it is more about categorizing it with [[Computing]]. The best part of having wikis like ours is that we can just pull and share at will with little friction. 
** There's a significant difference between 2020 and 2017-19. Keep it up, sir. `/salute`
