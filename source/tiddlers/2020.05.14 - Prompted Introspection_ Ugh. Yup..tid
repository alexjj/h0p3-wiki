title: 2020.05.14 - Prompted Introspection: Ugh. Yup.

!! When do you think about your regrets the most often?

This question is a matter of accountability, and so I shouldn't set it aside. [[2018.10.12 - Prompted Introspection: Regrets]] is only the beginning, I hope. Part of the issue is that there are different kinds of regrets, and I aim to regret those which ought to be regretted to whatever degree I should, [[WINTCIS]]. 

I think about my regrets on my walks with my wife, late at night while I'm trying to fall asleep (it helps so much), and when I'm reading. I probably don't regret enough. [[TDL]]s, in particular, are these daily reminders of my choice to fail. Ugh. Yup.
