How has your weekend been man?
May 25 1:16pm
Yo =)
May 25 1:46pm
My weekend was good. I've been getting more sleep.
May 25 1:46pm
How about you?
May 25 1:46pm
How's the family?
May 25 1:47pm
Good weekend. Family is good. Making shrimp gumbo tonight! I succumbed to the call of my recently departed addiction this morning. I'm disappointed in myself. But I showed alot of self discipline for nearly 90 days. And since I'm on call I can't drink. Kratom...
May 25 1:52pm
We have been staying up. Late watching inappropriate shows and sleeping in. Lol.
May 25 1:52pm
Sadly, I've had terrible depression and zero desire to do anything. No joy in life for the last ~ 90 days. One dose and on my tractor bushogging one of the fields right now and enjoying music with headphones.
May 25 1:54pm
Life's a bitch. ðŸ˜‚
May 25 1:54pm
90 days is a helluva stretch.
May 25 2:00pm
I am, of course, terrible on this front. I don't understand what's wrong with kratom usage, but I am glad that you able to wrestle control when you feel you need it.
May 25 2:01pm
Shrimp gumbo sounds excellent. I've not had gumbo in forever.
May 25 2:02pm
I got addicted. I don't like being addicted to anything.
May 25 2:02pm
I hear that.
May 25 2:03pm
I still smoke cigarettes. Usually 3 or so a day. But if I never had another one. I would be find.
May 25 2:03pm
Fine*
May 25 2:03pm
The kratom changed my personality. Started using from 4am till I went to bed.
May 25 2:03pm
It got out of hand.
May 25 2:03pm
You and I both have addictive personalities.
May 25 2:04pm
It fucked my brain chemicals up. Used up all my feel good chemicals.
May 25 2:04pm
One dose and I feel good about life... Obviously something is off.
May 25 2:05pm
Hopefully one does does not create withdrawal symptoms like I had. It should not. Than hopefully K can use more responcibly
May 25 2:07pm
How is adjusting to [[k0sh3k]]'s return to work. Any better this week?
May 25 2:10pm
I know yall were back to school as well. Do you take the weekends off?
May 25 2:11pm
Might be worth talking with some folks here: https://www.reddit.com/r/quittingkratom/
May 25 2:12pm
Most seem to recover before that 90 mark. You might be right about having burned out parts of your chemical rewards system (I've never heard of that from Kratom, but I have from true opioids).
May 25 2:13pm
[[k0sh3k]] hasn't returned yet. She might return in July.
May 25 2:14pm
She's still busy AF though since she's the one in charge of setting up policy for all the other librarians to open up, maybe in July (won't have student workers).
May 25 2:14pm
I am a member of a quitting kratom group on Facebook. Very similar.
May 25 2:15pm
I can't imagine working from home like that. Gotta be tough. Alot of my family and wife's family is doing it.
May 25 2:15pm
Haha. Then I get called into work. Gotta take parts to another base an hour and a half away.
May 25 3:11pm
ugh. Sorry man. =/
May 25 3:11pm
Prolly make $400 - $500.id rather be at home cooking gumbo. Lol
May 25 3:13pm
Shit, that's some sick money tho.
May 25 3:13pm
Nice to be at home.
May 25 3:13pm
Hopefully, the girls will be able to cook it up in time for an evening meal.
