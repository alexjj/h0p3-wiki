title: 2020.04.27 - Computer Musings: Shadowsocks

* I'm simply unhappy with the AIO browser-based proxy tooling. 
** The performance sucks, I have to mess with it too often, and I'm still unhappy with middlemen here. 
*** Grateful to those donating, ofc.
* Shadowsocks set up on Dallas
* Could just do commandline, but I like the GUI here. Gonna use that for now on [[monster-16]].
* I assume I'm going to get boned somewhere down the road here, but we'll see.
** An arms race of rules.

* Better route, since obviously they are fingerprinting to blacklist. Turned randomized user-agent switching back on. Voila, it works. 
** Gonna keep the proxy up but unused for now, anywho.
* Sticking it to the man with my tiny pecker again, thankfully:
** Flooding search queries and clickthroughs for Ad nauseum. Pollution is about as useful as steganography.
*** Officially, fuck you.
