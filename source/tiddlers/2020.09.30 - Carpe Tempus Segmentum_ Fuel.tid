title: 2020.09.30 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Fuel

I still have [[chameleon]]'s smooth fucking channel playing and sometimes lofi. If I were not lazy, I would rip the streams or have a better way to track back (because I often don't know I want to keep a song until after I've heard it). 

* Sleep by 1?
* Woke at 9
** Nightmares. Went full Joker during the debate last night. I see the weight on everyone too. It was sleep though. 
* [[Morning Routine]]
** Interrupted. Plus an extra kiss. I adore having her home.
* Read
* Standing worship-//Skintime// with [[k0sh3k]] as she told me about her interview.
** Wearing that grey knit dress I picked out at Goodwill a few years ago.
** Waiting on appraisal, asking around for an inspector. 
*** Not sure if it would work, but I think I may tip them extra cash to let me follow them around and listen to them talk. An expert's eye, I need to see what they do.
** Gonna need to buy some tools to work on the attic and basement. Gonna have wiring and hopefully some plumbing to do.
* Annoyed my offspring
** Both have their doors locked during schoolwork. Welp. I'm glad they care about privacy and getting away with fucking off.
** Encouraged them to be ready for our walk.
* LoL+Chips+Salsa+Coffee
* Read+Write
* Walk With Offspring
** Sex, gender, evolution, and economic discussion ran deep.
** Familiar faces today, including Alex.
*** He stopped to speak with us. Seemed to be doing well enough.
** Representation, rapid soup to nuts rabbithole. They have good instincts.
*** My son needs way more practice speaking. Paragraph writing just isn't enough.
** Daughter is still failing. 
** I like that we continue to try to [[TDL]] the rest of the day (though it hasn't worked out well enough yet).
** Thinking about the house.
* Made a chocolate cake with offspring.
* My wife is too willing to let go of her hard-won remote time. I can appreciate the nerves she must feel.
* Inform the Men!
* Meditation
* Shower of the gods!
* Offspring refused help, okay.
* Vapelyfe, light. 
** Keeps getting lighter. 
* Read+Write
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Chops, pierogies, carrots, apples, cake, water
*** Going easy on the cake, and going slow like [[L]]. I like the way she eats cake.
** [[Debatable]], only did 3, but prefer 5 where each offspring gets a turn with each person. 
*** Often I can just ask a question and they'll know where to go next. I don't even have to say my claim. 
**** I like when I get to run through my gauntlet and then say, "I agree with you."
* Read+Write
* Conflict With Offspring Over Meal-planning
** Handed cards. Both hand to stand in the pocket with me. Poor arguments from both of them. 
*** Interesting to see her want to argue that she's not creative. 
* Computer Musings
** `sudo pacman -S perl-file-mimeinfo --noconfirm`
*** `mimeopen -d foobar.html` 
** `yay -S xdg-utils-mimeo`
*** xdg-utils removed
** Meh. Editing `~/.config/mimeapps.list` by hand seems easier still.
** Still can't find a way to get .onion links to open automagically

I ate too much, but I exercised enough. I'm not being efficient enough in the pseudo-morning. I like that I don't have to be, but I need to get back on the horse. Not convinced I should wait to walk with my offspring; they just waste the time.
