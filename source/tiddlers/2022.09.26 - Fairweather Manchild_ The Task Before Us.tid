It's a pleasure to meet you. I appreciate your reaching out to me. Please let me know if I can [[help]] you. 

> Hello I imagine you are Hope? the author of the Philosopher.Life hypertext? I appreciate your erudition & eudaimonic hacksmithy.

Indeed, [[I Am h0p3]], and I [[hope]] to be so [[irwartfrr]]. I am the principal author and architect of this work. This is my vocation, and I do my best.

> I wanted to say thank you for hopping in at r/sorceryofthespectacle. 

I've kept my eye on a few there over the years, including the illustrious [[Impassionata]] and [[Anders Aamodt]].<<ref "c">> It is somewhat uncommon for me to enter conversations (though I usually have a flood of thoughts part of me wishes to express, I've not found it a wise use of my time<<ref "i">>). I felt obligated to step in, in your case. Too few take seriously our moral obligations, the demands of charity, and the implications of such a thing, even in that community. I offer myself as a [[wrestling]] partner to all as well.

> I feel validated in knowing our cause is gaining momentum with each connection that is made through our discourses here. 

What do you think is that cause? 

I've seen a great deal of fragmentation in SotS over the years, and I am not a fan of gnosticism, postmodernism, or [[cult]]s. I do, however, recommend SotS to [[others]] as a critical community to digest. There are many voices I am trying to understand. I'd like to know more about what you think of the community and its telos.

> I am fond of your pursuit of the eudaimonic lifetime, I suppose I must associate it with la vita nuova of Dante and with something from monastic experiences. 

That is high praise. Thank you. Perhaps like you, I am increasingly convinced it is a monastic experience, though I did not intend it to be.<<ref "r">> I appreciate your [[PSM]] as well. I admire your courage and [[reconstructivity|Reconstruction]]. I would like to know more about your life (I never know enough about my interlocutors). Tell me about yourself, please. 

> I am unsure of my way, but I believe it is a path through many terrains & it has taken me to discourse with you here, if you would like to.

I'm honored that you would take the time to speak with me about [[philosophy]], sir. Thank you. I wish I knew how to explain to you what our opportunity means to me, especially in what may be the short spacetime we have. Of course, I may not have anything crucial or effective to express to you. I am blind man wandering the desert. Do what you will with my ramblings and questions. Every person is my teacher. `/bow`. 

Yes, I would [[like]] to, [[nomad]]. Thank you.

> I think this is precisely the social mode we must perform our way into and out of in this new act. 

I am not convinced we ought fully disengage from such a process, even under ideal conditions. 

What new act? 

> We need to find out what it means to be a pseudonymous consciousness at its limits. 

That's an interesting phrase. There may be some valuably distinctive interpretations of what consists in a pseudonymous consciousness. Pseudonymity with respect to whom, and to what [[dok]]?

> At its upper limits, it is the same things as being Brahman, being untethered to subject-positions. 

I am open to the claim that the context of all contexts somehow isn't a subject-position, or at the very least, that is there is no particular mind like ours that has such a perspective. Why do you think taking pseudonymity to (presumably) the Nth degree points toward such a thing?

> But what lets us bring Brahman back to materiality without being stuck in the realm of forms? Perhaps it is the Name.

The [[name]] seems to be part of it. I agree. Even if there were only forms, there would still be The Name.

> A person is a named and a naming thing. 

Beyond that all things have names into [[infinigress]], I'm sympathetic to the claim that persons are persons, in part, because they are coming to grips with the nature of telling themselves their own stories (though, one may be objectively wrong in one's subjective naming, of course). So, I agree that naming things may be a necessary condition of personhood. Beyond simply the ability to name, I will add to your claim that only moral autonomy, an "up to us" freedom of intentionality, is sufficient for personhood. 

> Without the power of that Name, the universe of names will yield up none of its far immenser powers.

I'll agree there is no such thing as [[power]] without a [[name]], but I have no idea how to speak of a universe without names either. I can't even say that makes sense, is possible, or is even a valuable exploration. [[Naming and Necessity]] is a hard problem, too. I would agree that sometimes all we can do is point, sometimes in [[silence]].

In case it need be said, I [[hope]] to be wise in identifying the powers of reality, and I wish to be slow to claim it has agency. 

> When we speak about civilizations, cultures, industries having powers, having consciousness, I feel a mounting sense that we are talking about a universe of common names with protected means of consensual definitions.

I am slow to say there is such a thing as an emerging collective consciousness. I appreciate the metaphor though.

I agree there is a universe of common names, and not merely socially constructed either. I am open to the claim that all communication is translation. Language games require common ground and reference. I cannot say we consensually [[share]] definitions in all cases. Having been brainwashed growing up, I've a kneejerk reaction to that claim.

> Names are precisely what we will always agree we must disagree on. 

I disagree. =D. I don't think most people even care about this topic, even if they should. Plenty will have poor judgment on the topic. I don't think you mean precisely what you've said. That might be the rhetorical point.

I suggest we should be engaged in [[The Original Position]] to prioritize our naming, in some sense. It's part of our mission as philosophers to [[wrestle]] with [[others]] about the nature of reality and what is [[salient]] about it.

> Just as, to be of the Essenes, you tolerate those who have children, if you choose to be pure & devout, because without them, your culture cannot survive your piety. Namefulness has its delights and its dangers. We perhaps should theorize new sorts of half-names, altered states of nomenclature that are inside multiple worlds doing different things.

I'll agree we must explore [[The Infinite]] together. It is often the job of the philosopher to clarify ambiguities of a word, to create words, to select which words are more [[salient]] to a context than others. It is a quite a task before us.

> Thank you for introducing yourself in this manner, your contribution is vital.

`/salute`. I am glad you found it useful. 

I respect your demand for our respect of the dignity of your personhood, and I wanted to carefully point out my minor disagreement while supporting what I believe was your thesis. It is quite a duty. I hate to say it, but SotS has plenty of people who aren't kind (which, as you know, is not the same thing as being nice); I appreciate you're standing up.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
