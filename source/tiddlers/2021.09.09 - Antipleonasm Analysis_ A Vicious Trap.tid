I often find that people never mature beyond that point though, especially if they tend to be so self-centered they lack the humility to think the answer is external to them. Are you going to commit the dishonest crimes of Sir Nietzsche? If you continually choose to never escape the trap, at some point, I'm going to stop feeling as sorry for you (at some point, it's not up to me).<<ref "w">> ‚ä•Elim correctly.

So, let's say you bite the question-begging bullet of our plight, what are you going to //do// with that claim? It matters, right? Okay, so [[W5H]] into [[infinigress]] ([[hope]]fully [[irwartfrr]])? Pursue the meaningful ends, telic-creature. Live it. I consider it the opportunity of a lifetime, a pursuit filled with [[awe]], suffering, and reality.
