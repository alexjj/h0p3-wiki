I am curious about the possibility of different interpretations, matchings, and presentations of current events from AI. To be an effective weapon, it doesn't need to be able to write in such a way that no human can recognize it isn't human, but rather just that most targets couldn't. It also doesn't need to have its own consistent internal point of view to be dangerous. Predictive sentiment analysis alone would be incredible, but that's probably baby shit compared to what world-class engineers can build with it. The weaponizability of what we already have may be considerable. I have no idea how to estimate it, let alone the considerable evolution of this technology. I remain unconvinced that this is the correct use of our resources without a justified political (and hence economic) system already in place.

There are moral limits to the pursuit of peace derived from understanding ourselves to be part of an adventure in the universe as one, embracing all particular drives towards conformations of various appearances to reality. Given the telos of persons, our ideals and undertakings are not isolated, even though they may be particularized to our contexts to some [[dok]]. We are connected with other people's struggles for actualizing their own ideals insofar as they meet the conditions of the [[CI]] (an ideal community exercising [[TOP]]). Peace may arise from appreciating how each person contributes something unique while also being part of a larger effort striving towards discovering new goods which constitute the creative advancement within the material universe, but that does not make peace conceptually justified, only prima facie worthy. It is the long-term ideal we must strive for, but dialectically, the means to such an end often includes pursuing the opposite of peace in the short-term.

Discourse Triangle: [Rhetorically Convincing ∨ Salient Truth-telling ∨ Inoffensive] ∧ ¬[Rhetorically Convincing ∧ Salient Truth-telling ∧ Inoffensive]...Naw, I think inoffensiveness is ultimately a rhetorical matter, and that is really just a matter of hedons for most. [Rhetorically Convincing ∨ Salient ∨ True] ∧ ¬[Rhetorically Convincing ∧ Salient ∧ True]. Closer, but no cigar.

I need a German word for the disappointment of having unwrapped a gift presented as some mysterious object only to find nothing or even worse inside.

I'm not really a native English speaker; it's a learned bridge mask that barely functions despite enormous effort. People don't want to be willing to spend time assessing responses to all their claims, but they still want to make their claims. Like, just let me express myself, but: you shouldn't do the same, and I won't talk about what "should" really means with you either. Does it really feel like a wordy response that lacks actual content that should be discouraged? Like, why aren't you writing only for me and my comfort, given exactly my knowledge and perspective? But, of course, anything which doesn't fit these requirements surely isn't a valid contribution to the conversation. XD. For those of us who sound like bots, prepare to be treated like garbage even more. Perhaps it will become a good thing in time, providing a Transatlantic rhetorical, sentimental, and stylistic accent of the quintessential MLA formatted 5th grade essay that unites our ears in the long-run. Meh. Seems like a reason to continue to push toward the schizogibberish instead.
