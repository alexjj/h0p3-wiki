Hey there....how‚Äôs summer in Connecticut?
May 31 3:06pm
yo!
May 31 3:18pm
üòä‚ù§Ô∏è
May 31 3:18pm
It's going well. The weather has varied considerably this week. [[k0sh3k]] has the day off, and she's soaking it in. Normal grind today otherwise for the rest of us.
May 31 3:20pm
How about you? How's your health?
May 31 3:20pm
Doing pretty good ‚Äîits a headache day but starting to lift
May 31 3:20pm
Noice.
May 31 3:20pm
Shoulder getting better though...how are you feeling?
May 31 3:20pm
In a groove, grinding. Hiki reply mode to the world. Accepting what is not in my power. Continuing to stabilize the house and cultivate whatever we can. I've slept better in the past few months than I have in a very long time.
May 31 3:22pm
How are [[AG]] and [[UJ]] doing?
May 31 3:22pm
They are good ‚Äî[[AG]] is working at the school doing summer camp from 10-5 every day and will be at an engineering program at Georgia Tech from June 23-30
May 31 3:24pm
Hell yeah. Dope.
May 31 3:24pm
That's quite a blessing.
May 31 3:24pm
[[UJ]] has to help with summer school for the next three weeks and then should have some good time off
May 31 3:25pm
Meantime I am slowing trying to get the house done
May 31 3:25pm

May 31 3:25pm
Super cute.
May 31 3:26pm
It's like Southern Gothic to me
May 31 3:26pm
Hopefully, [[UJ]] will get some much needed rest. Been a helluva year for him, I assume.
May 31 3:27pm
Still need to do the floor and finish the cabinets ‚Äîworking on the cabinets now
May 31 3:27pm
Got a new sink and faucet but waiting for the counter to come in
May 31 3:29pm
What kind of faucet and sink did you get?

May 31 3:36pm
Gonna stain the counter a grayish
May 31 3:36pm
Yeah, those are going to look great. Don't think I've ever seen a sink like that either.
May 31 3:37pm
Looks spacious.
May 31 3:37pm
Its called a farmhouse sink
May 31 3:37pm
Could bathe a human in it.
May 31 3:37pm
Sits under the counter and shows the front
May 31 3:38pm
Were you able to graduate this month?
May 31 3:42pm

May 31 3:42pm
Yes!!!! I be done

May 31 3:42pm
Congratz! =)
May 31 3:43pm
Ah, she's gonna like that.
May 31 3:43pm
I hope so ‚Äîits like a mini college experience for 8 days
May 31 3:44pm
Nice to have that primer, something to reflect on before diving in.
May 31 3:45pm
Hoping it will help her see what the get up in your own, get along with a roommate, take your meds experience üòä
May 31 3:45pm
Plus, I bet the classes are a blast. Maybe she might meet some more friends too, never know.
May 31 3:46pm
I hope so üòä she struggles in school because most of her class doesn‚Äôt share her interests...[[L]] has explained to her that college has more people and she will find her ‚Äúnerd herd‚Äù there
May 31 3:47pm
Heck yeah. And, in engineering school, it will be even more concentrated.
May 31 3:48pm
Yes!
May 31 3:48pm
Excited for her!
May 31 3:48pm
It is expensive but hopefully will be worth it
May 31 3:49pm
Yes ma'am. Doin' whatcha can.
May 31 3:49pm
Exactly
May 31 3:49pm
How are [[j3d1h]] and [[1uxb0x]] and [[5c0ut]]?
May 31 3:52pm
[[5c0ut]] is stable, working hard, swimming through a sea of sociopaths, keeping his head above water. We chill a lot in the basement, like any decent neckbeards. Still practicing craft, reading and writing a lot too.
May 31 3:54pm
Proud of him and you for supporting him
May 31 3:54pm
[[1uxb0x]]'s been reading, less writing than we'd like. I probably lose 30% of my games in magic to him these days. Been finding groups to speak with online, which is cool. Gonna be taller than me soon enough, I think. We both enjoying taking walks together, so that's a blessing.
May 31 3:57pm
That is good ‚Äîsometimes teenagers don‚Äôt want to spend time with adults

[[j3d1h]] is doing her thing. Drawing for her ask blog (https://ask-broken-souls.tumblr.com/), she brought her vixivivo project down, and her wiki is now at https://theta.wiki/ (though she uses it rarely; I walk through her yearly cross-sections these days in Family Time). She's selling a vehicle, so that's been interesting to see her do. Up late talking to her friends consistently. Generally expensive to speak with me, and I'm glad she pays the price.
May 31 4:01pm
Nice! She is a mature old soul ‚Äîlove her for that
May 31 4:06pm
Is she driving yet?
May 31 4:06pm
That will be at least a year from now.
May 31 4:07pm
Gotcha

May 31 6:12pm
Love these...think [[k0sh3k]] would too hehe üòú
May 31 6:12pm
Yes, that is correct. She likes that place.
