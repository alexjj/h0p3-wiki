!! About:

I have a difficult time trying to describe how large this ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 is. It may have more uses than that. As per [[chameleon]], I'm going to think about other approaches to this set of [[Timelines]].


---
!! Principles:

* Construct a hand/[[Firmcoded|Firmcoding]] list all of pages in [[New]] ordering. Update when you want.
* Make it so that people can open this page without freezing their browsers for too long.


---
!! Focus:

* [[⧖]]
** [[https://philosopher.life/#⧖]] is a [[beautiful]] [[link]]. 


---
!! Vault:

* (*crickets*)


---
!! Dreams:

* Complete [[Firmcoding]] of this page would be cool. Barring that, I would like a script to ease the process. Don't forget the zero-width character.
* If possible, fix the broken links (TW problem, I think).
* The length of [[title.Titles]] makes it ugly, and perhaps this should be fixed by truncating and [[alias]]ing the wikilink.
* I would like the macro for the open_all_from_date green function back, but that too is kinda ugly (probably has to be firmcoded per line too).
