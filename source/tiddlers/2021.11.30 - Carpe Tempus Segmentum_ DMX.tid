title: 2021.11.30 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: DMX

Massage. //Skintime// and //China, IL// (is the best at math!) with [[ASK]]. Pizza. Fireman Time! Continue to argue with my daughter that she should fall asleep and prepare for adulthood. Wake up, child. Sleep by 3:30?

Woke at 9:45. Not quite enough, but I feel solid. Pushed brix. Hugs'n'bugs for all. [[5c0ut]] looks comfy today. I need to start wearing sweaters too (but they get uncomfortable for me, like a fucking autist, drives me insane). My daughter was clearly up quite late, but she worked not to hold back the grumbles. //Skintime// with [[ASK]]. Fireman Time! Worked on what I would call artistic things.<<ref "g">> [[TTTOTW]].

[[5c0ut]] came down with us. Final stage of his interview for the restaurant. Pay is solid (not what he deserves, but it'll do well), and he's pretty nervous. He very much liked the gifts I selected for my girls (though, he only saw one, since I only had the time to show one while [[ASK]] was away). We planned to hit the Asian market and check pricing against Amazon. [[TTTOTW]].

Offspring came down to grind. Chat with [[T-Money]] and [[ASmith]] as well. Four of us down here walking through DarkMX, talking about, testing, and exploring it together. We had a blast. My daughter quickly tore everything apart in her testing. Bugs and flaws found. Still piecing together what this thing could be, not just what it is. 

[[ASK]] was feeling blue and scared. //Skintime// and talked. Much better. I predict many such events. I will earn my right, proof after proof. It is beyond rare that I synchronize so clearly with anyone.

Mi amor was still grinding her Greek. One week of class left, deadlines all over the place, and her sleep is taking a hit (she's feeling tired, but not sleepy, and no where near Milligan levels [still trying to gauge]). //Raw Skintime// with mi amor. Soaking her in. 

Bugged [[ASK]] in the kitchen. She's cookin' up a storm. [[TTTOTW]] with mi amor. Ranga came down to sit in her lap (a rare treat) while she took a hit of her monster, workin' on her wiki (the woman is relentless). We talked about Dave of The Gnomes. Apparently, we aren't the only people to notice he's not put them up this year. I had [[previously asked him|2021.09.07 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Gang Gang Karencore]] if he wanted help with it, and he had an odd response, like he had a lot on his mind regarding these. Maybe something is up. The dude is obviously depressed from 50 feet away. Almost went out to his door (not sure what to bring), but maybe he's just late and I'd be intruding or something. I'm going to wait a bit more.

[[Family Gathering]] was solid. [[ASK]] made a miso mushroom broth rice soup (I'm not sure what to call it) with spring rolls. I had water too and high fructose buns too. We watched The Chucky Cheese brother episode of //House//. No //Skintime// because there was a Ranga in [[k0sh3k]]'s lap (who is still in the seat as I write...which is uncommon, and we're worried he's feeling sick now, as this matches some past behavior). I should have asked [[ASK]].

[[TTTOTW]]. //Skintime// with [[ASK]]. More reassurance.
