title: 2020.06.07 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Familia

* Woke at 11 
** Glasses of wine put me under. I had a style of dream I've not had in a while. I have no idea how to describe it, but it theme to its narrative that makes it more social than usual. 
* Thinking about the [[T42T]] of doubting our existence. A [[Straussian]] dialectical problem.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Read+Write
* [[Family Time]]
** [[TTP]]s weren't as egregious this time around, but they weren't easy. Dialectures and wrestling hard at some points.
** 1-on-1s
*** Super fucking chill.
*** Got to spoon with my wife. 
* Break
* Walk+Talk
* Fireman Time!
* Rice, kimchi, wantons
** I'm the only one who likes kimchi this much. They've simply humored me.
* Read our wikis!
** Slow going. We talked and wandered.
** My wife laughed multiple times at my [[arrogance]] and stupidity today. 
*** She peaked into [[Saint Hegel]] and said there was no fucking way we could talk about this in the time we have. Lol. 
*** Also, my `<3` for Saint Aristotle in the timeline; my disdain for everyone's opinion knows no bounds. =)
*** I also got a gag ;P. 
** I adore what we're doing. 
** Offspring got pretty tired.
* [[Family Log]]
* Walk+Talk
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 2
