title: 2020.11.25 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: RIP Doubleliptu

There are leaves everywhere in my house. They've been trampled in through front and back doors. 

* Woke at 2
** Feels good man.
* Leftover pizza slices and water
* Read+Write+Walk+Talk
** Feeling meh about how behind I am in my wiki, lol.
* Attempt sleep by 8...
* Woke at 2:15
* Read
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Bugged my offspring.
** My dude is all set. Like hugging a Michelin Man in black wearing his coat indoors. 
** My daughter is not feeling happy. She has a break, friends to chill with, fun stuff to do, nothing expected of her besides a subset of necessary chores that cost her little. She's feeling bleh and consistently at that. =(. I know that feel.
*** Depression sucks. Nearly impossible for her not to face it. It is a chance for us to succeed. 
*** She got hugs from everyone and smiled/laughed with us. Small things.
* Bugged my wife. 
** Plans for nothing. Dope.
** Held me and smothered me because I'm chilly and autistic. She told me about her book.
*** Slowing down to think about its relation to CV19.  
** She landed a rear-naked choke on me.<<ref "b">> 
* Inform the Men!
* Meditation
* Shower of the gods!
* Read
* //A Queen's Gambit//
* More talk with my daughter. May we rebuild stronger.
** As we have known for a while, depression and anxiety will be nearly inevitable for both my offspring (I wish I had known for myself). No one in any of our families escapes it (most people experience a major mental illness in their lives, but my kind do not escape it...it can only be managed and channeled). It is our opportunity to grow these psychic muscles, resilience, and trust. There are likely going to be bad years. If she breaks (and who doesn't?), I want her to feel comfortable having us catch her.
*** No one should be sane or in good shape after understanding what she does about the world. It is a burden for anyone, not just a 14yo.
*** I am [[grateful]] that we have time for this. It is never ideal, but the major push is still a few years away. 
* Cookin'
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Stirfry cobbled together with what we have. 
** My wife made iced ginger tea for me. It is sharp.
*** We are addicted to strong sensations, spikes in our [[phenomenology]]. 
** [[MTG]]:
*** Son's D&T+1 vs MWC. 
**** Discussed the matchup in advance. Too many stacks and interactions to not have some tutoring. 
***** Kept me locked with 4 ports (made us laugh), SFM->Batterskull, some fish, but completely unable to do anything. Had the pulse for upkeep, but even with STPs there was never enough difference to use it. Flickered my Elspeth before ultimate (smart boy; also, I fucked up missing a turn on it...I keep making mistakes I shouldn't be making). He never gave me a single opening to ORing his Batterskull. Squeezed out three sweepers, and we agreed that scoop was right (I'm not the sort that wins in a hurry on MWC, e.g. I don't Elspeth jump until I've a hardlock in most cases).
