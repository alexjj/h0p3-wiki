!! Audit:

* 400+ links
* Felt much stronger pull because of the election.
* Warms my heart to see my wiki offers something fun during [[Family Time]]. Everyone opens the maymays like they are treats.
* Looking through this, I see my wife has shaped it considerably. She's a serious source of links for me. 
** I have no fucking clue how she has the time for it. E-mail addict. 
*** Chooses low-hanging fruit mainstream methods, and she doesn't wade through bullshit or discussions.
* Puking up my guts. Love it.
* More economics in here than usual. New source.
* I cleared a lot of old tabs out. `/salute`
* Seems like waves of days hit. 3 of them this month. 
* Very lucky to have so much //Stunning!// (any at all, really)
* It's clear as ever that I have no idea how to find links for almost any [[others]] as individuals.
* I appreciate how my offspring can come back to this when they are willing. I hope they do, and I hope it makes them smile and provides them with a great deal to think about.
* As usual, some of these [[title.Title]]s are fragments worth thinking about (and, they capture my mood).
