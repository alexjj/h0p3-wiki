* Read+Write
* AFireman Time!
* Leftovers and Garbage.TV
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 6?
* Woke at Noon?
** Acceptable.
* [[JRE]] Called 
** We talked politics and philosophy the entire time. 
*** That's a place he should write. I know he doesn't have much time and energy with babies.  
** Vaush, [[TOP]], idpol, sexual economics, socialism, democracy, rhetoric, etc.
** Seemed to be in good spirits
* Chilled upstairs with my wife. I came up, and she made calls with realtors. She was waiting for me again to listen to the calls with her.
* Fireman Time!
* //Skintime// and breathing
** Girl doesn't know how to breathe. She's cute when she argues though.
* Cleaning
* Was going to go shoppping, but they took too long, and the meetup was earlier than anticipated.
* Walk With Offspring
** Couldn't stray far, and had to head back for coats. It's officially fucking cold. 
** Even though we didn't have long, I'm glad we did.
** The puns have got to stop. Will institute a family rule soon enough. I have spoken.
* Went to //The Asylum//
** Did our walkthrough again.
*** It's interesting that realtor is still "planning" what we'll do with the house with us even though there is no reason to pitch anymore.
** Two-inches of paperwork with the lawyer on the horn. 
*** I actually had to sign some documents, surprisingly.
** Realtor got to see my wife read faster than the rest of us combined while speaking with the lawyer. Showoff. We are all, ofc, jelly.
*** Despite her nervousness, she kinda took over the meeting, as she does.
** We all patted ourselves on the back, merrily jizzed, etc. 
** I'm glad I got to sit back and listen without having to be called upon too often to socially engage. The finalization process seemed to check out to me from the outside.
*** I just gave thumbs-up where appropriate.
** Invited Terri (and her fam) for dinner
*** She said she didn't seem to connect with our daughter, but she missed our son.
** We have keys in hand. It's a thing now. 
** Thermostat is set to make sure pipes don't freeze.
* Made my wife uncomfortable driving. It has been a while since she's been the passenger while I'm driving stick. Stick is fun.<<ref "f">>
** Nothing beats the "motorcy" in high density Thailand though. Back then, she would just shut her eyes while sitting sidesaddle stoically accepting that if we had an accident, then we were probably just going to die.
*** I would like to credit the hours I've spent in racing games for preparing me to parkour with the bike on the various surfaces and between the various shifting dangers (particularly in a culture that did not value life [or the lives of others] much).
** Car rides were nice. Wish we had more time. I should have slowed down.
* //Star Trek//, jerky, coffee (and taking nips of my wife's ginger beer whenever I knew she would see me doing it ;P)
* Read+Write

I got a lot of kisses in today from everyone. Dope AF.
