*** Classic work again from Kevin. Fanboi here. Love your Tor doubt, standalone, shit just fucking works. There are several competitors in this space, and I'm hoping you'll keep working on this. I hope this is a prototype. 
**** Hyper/IPFS/Zeronet/Resilio Sync, Loki/i2pd/yggdrasil, Retroshare/Aether, Pinephone. All worth your time. Nestable, distributed VMs over onion-routed networks. 
*** Unfortunately, the license isn't free. Do whatcha gotta do.
