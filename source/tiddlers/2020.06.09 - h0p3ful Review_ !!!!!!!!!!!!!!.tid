*[[Notage Ti.38]]
** I'm excited to see you diving into taking charge of your accounts (please don't forget to use your password manager!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<<ref "!">>). 
** I'm excited to see you gain some basic skills with git and running your own server. 
*** Remember, you will iterate and practice to grow. You can do this!
*[[2020.06.08 – Wiki Review: There'ren't]]
** I've carried you many times while you were sleeping too. Still do from time to time, but you will soon be so big I can't unless it was an emergency. It's a potent feeling as a dad to be unable to hold your offspring.  
*[[2020.06.08 – TDL: 13 & 14]]
** I am grateful that you are trying to be specific here. I know it's not fun.
*[[2020.06.08 – Prompted Introspection: Universe]]
** That is quite a belief. Why do you believe it?
*** There are lots of philosophers you should check out!
*[[2020.06.08 – Carpe Diem: Gardens and duchies]]
** Neat. I would like a tag for this. I'm fine with having your notes in here, but slap some metadata on it.
*[[2020.06.08 – Antipleonasm Analysis: Sometimes]]
** 10 times at most? Where did you get this figure? If you are going to shit on 10k, can't I shit on 10? 
*** It might be better to couch it differently. I know plenty of people don't like the ambiguous language like "maybe," "roughly," "seems," "often," "sometimes," etc. Sometimes it fits though. 
**** We're supposed to be certain, right? =)
*** What I'm saying is: you might want to try writing this again, maybe once.
*[[Ten Things you need to know about the Future]]
** Quick, let us send this off to buzzfeed forthwith.
** This is neat, btw. I'm glad to see you thinking about it.
*[[An answer to time and the decentralization of it.]]
** I like that you are trying to grow this place. Keep an open mind. You should spend time looking at what experts have to say about this. It is an ancient problem. You might save yourself some time by avoiding reinventing the wheel, including going down less fruitful paths.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** I'm glad you get time off. =)
