title: 2021.09.27 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Talkative

<<<
[[ASK]]ing. Salad + chips + sweetbread (the Puerto Rican baked kind from the W-Entity, shit is cash, yo). Attempts at LEC Playoffs. [[TTTOTW]]. 

I don't remember when I slept or woke. Blurry. [[TTTOTW]].

//Raw Skintime//. Told me about church, and she's gonna be teaching labyrinths and doing Catechism. My farts were too much. She required that we leave the room if we were to continue (those burritos were worth it). //Inform the Men!// Meditation. Shower of the gods!

[[Family Time]] at 3? Rough for the offspring, particularly my daughter. Honesty is so expensive, and dishonesty even moreso. It got better though. I had a sandwich too. I finished everything but my portion of the [[Family Log]], and I couldn't stay awake. Falling asleep on the couch, so they let me go down. Everyone came down for //Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home//, which is likely the best of the bunch (and, no, you're wrong, as usual). I slept through most of it too. I think I didn't really get up until 9? 

One of my games with her, while she is reading, is to loudly reinterpret sentences with as much sexual innuendo as possible. Usually, there is a deeper narrative that arises. It's very important to examine the contrast between the surface story and the underlying one. This turned out to be easy tonight with her Greek translation. I succeeded in distracting her while also dry humping. Eventually, she elbowed me in the throat, so I decided to stop. 

I scared her tonight. I opened and closed the door while she had her head turned, as though I left. It was a few minutes before she looked my direction. =D.

Water + Vapelyfe + LEC Playoffs + [[TTTOTW]]. Assignments. Put her to bed. Son and I made very, very late dinner together. <3.  Tendies and salad. Gonna be slowly making room in our garage area behind me. We're moving the catbox onto the very edge of The Den. We're doing it gradually. Footbath + [[TTTOTW]]. [[ASK]]ing.

I'm doing something fun, easy, and I think useful: I'm taking my wife's advice (which was 20% a joke). "Feel free not to write so much next week." You got it (and, I doubt anyone will notice, and those who do, I doubt they'll complain<<ref "t">>). Considering how few actual breaks I take (even in the midst of chaos), I'm gonna take it and not feel too bad. Might as well build some buffer anyway. I have a feeling I may need it here in a few weeks.

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Sleep by 3?

Woke at 6. She's up. I can hear her hawt shuffle. She's wearing her collared flannel baby doll dress with brown fuzzy high-top boots (I think she's been moving away from the knee-high boots lately, and that is an odd change) from the W-Entity (a good find). She's wearing a new silver choker too. Sweet baby jesus, I think I need to fuck her soul. It's right above her Bermuda Triangle where I lose myself. [[Miss Direction]] was mean to me this morning, with a grin. =D. We had bagels, and she attempted to argue that her coffee (which has vanilla soy milk and honey in it) has zero calories with the straightest face she could come up with. I gave her a massage, and she's tight in that one spot on her right shoulder again. PT Becky knows that spot too, but she won't go HAM on it (I wish I could show Becky all the spots that need attention). I played grabass right up to the line the entire time. She's cute studying, doing her ADHD chaos routine (there's a 50% chance she'll forget what she's doing the moment she walks through her bedroom door).

Oh, someone left a tendie on the floor. Ants. That was fast. Also, I have a zit (I feel young again or something), right on the horn of my Jewnose. I'm not popping that shit. Too skeered. My wife handed me an ointment to put on it. We'll see if it turns me into Rudolph by lunch.

[[ASK]]ing. Lots to do. Put her* to bed (though I'm not sure she took her sleeping pills). She lives on [[music]] like I do. A [[.Goëtia. - Dark Magic Music|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iF7lkXKHlA]] lullaby playlist. [[TTTOTW]].

Sleep by 10. Woke at 3:30? Fireman Time! Cleaning.

Lightning Struck! [[ASK]]ing, [[Shah]] talked with me some too (I know it's quite painful to read my scribbles, madame. Yes, I am a 4eak. It's okay. You don't have to defend me. Just keep talking.).<<ref "i">> The tri-flurry.

She hid from me (payback), lol. Trying to see how long it would take for me to find her. Told me about one annoyance, then how she both should and shouldn't be worried about class (you know my opinion), and then went straight to her Greek. 

//The Walk// with my offspring. Drinks from [[The Den]] for everyone (son doesn't like the ~~tea~~ piss). Opened with me talking about my day (a rarity). Talked about Madame [[April|2021.01.04 - Prompted Introspection: April]] and what to look for. My daughter talked about Nate-of-Murican lit, lost canons, earned mistrust, and two creation stories that she felt weren't well-made (two adults arguing with this girl to be more charitable, but I gotcha). My son has been distracting us in the conversation quite a bit, a habit they have both acquired from a terrible creature. Vapelyfe. We rabbitholed, lightly. I didn't do as much of the talking. Streets were quite busy today (abnormally). Family with the rottweiler had to hand it off to the strapping lad to make sure it didn't come for us (I will never understand why people have an animal like this). Met a Brazilian man whose family has been redoing their frontlawn. We wave often. His name is Sherode(?), just moved here a couple years ago. Two sons, older. It was a masterclass in how not to have a conversation with a non-native speaker for my offspring; I completely failed to do this man justice. He was quite polite though, and he did his best. I'm not doing a good enough job eliciting discussion from my son about his work. He's slippery.

Shopping @ W-Entity with mi amor. We got some socks for her, but they don't have thick ones like she needs. More toiletry stock. Walked through the makeup dept, nothing she needs. Can't find her fridge here. We found plenty of food though. Her day at work was busy but good. She's finding misprints in her book, and more exceptions that her teacher said he was hoping to wait to encounter, trying to gloss over it instead (grimacing). Maybe that extra vitamin D is working. Our cashier was a riot. Sabrina (`/wave`) could not stop talking about a couple she follows online, with a nervous tick, and she joined right in our conversation like it was perfectly natural.

//Inform the Men!// I have waited all day. Mmm. Sometimes I am offered loot at the end. A keepsake. =). Meditation. Shower of the gods!

[[Family Gathering]]. My offspring made fish, tater tots, produce-based salad, and we had potato salad (kids these days...no idea what counts as fancy food; it kinda kills me a little bit inside that they don't adore potato salad...what kind of monsters are we raising?). The final episode of //House// S01, with Stacy's husband. I like watching powerful females pwn House. We get to see his humanity (and not the shitty opening episodes variety).

[[ASK]] is accelerating her plans. She's been making calls and looking for options. Oh, and a non-trivial health problem brought her to the ER. 

Thunder + [[TTTOTW]] + LEC.
