Look at the Wang on that Yang, My Ninja. Them is some fine ass bitches, Lads. A machine I adore, the transcendental proof itself flows of and through them to me. Let me say, all feminity is hawt. Can I get an amen! I know what kind of creature I am when I look upon you. My god. You are Beauty to me as far as I can ever know. I love that my woman can look me at the eyes, tenderly, longingly, and ask me: are you fucking stupid? "U is a stupid man in a stupid man suit, and I love you" is always the greatest honor I will ever know.

Do unto others and two others.
