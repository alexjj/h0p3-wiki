title: 2020.12.16 - Prompted Introspection: Intense Physical Pain

!! What's the most intense physical pain you've ever experienced?

I'm not a good judge of this. I think my max perceived physical pain has far more to do with my receptiveness, {[[Focus]]} of my ray of intentionality, and vividness of my autistic sensitivity than any particular event being standout physically painful. I've not been burned alive or given birth to children like my wife. I've been lucky on this front. `/knocks-on-wood`. 

I've had some moments where I just held myself and drooled in pain (just a few tablespoons worth). I can't remember what caused it though. I've also been punched and kicked in the balls plenty of times, and there's a special pain that goes with that (post-vasectomy I had to go to the ER, and that hurt too). Bangs against my perma Osgood–Schlatter and my precordial catch syndrome hurt. After my daughter was born, I pulled my neck really badly, I kept blacking out (eventually got to the hospital where my wife asked if they were really going to stick that whole needle into me). I've had a panic attack that felt like a heart attack (on the way up to JC), and at the time, we still weren't sure I didn't have a cardiovascular problem (I'm better at calming myself now). 

Oh, I know the winrar: food poisoning. My guts are never quite right even if sensitive. Fishfry at 12, Toronto at 16, Seafood of some kind at 29, and my last two in JC from sausage. It's bad. I think there's something extra retarded about my body, and it appears that this only gets worse with age. I get those cold sweats, and then I know I'm fucking in for it. It grows, and sometimes I still have a [[hope]] of shitting it out before it hits in full force. I'm just praying to my toilet that it will work. Eventually, I start blacking out from the pain (last time that started before I even got to the throne though). I've found the safest, most reliable, and even least pain inducing method is to lay belly down in the bathroom and shit straight up. I don't know how to begin to tell you how relieved I am to shit myself in those moments, Samwise. 

I've heard some men cannot piss themselves because they've been so thoroughly trained by convention that they will remain tortured until death if they aren't allowed to remove their pants. I'm open about sharting and shitting myself (more than most), but I still feel compelled to not actually empty my guts into my undies unless at least $100 + The Glory is on the line (I remain almost normal in this respect). But, during that pain, I just don't care at all. Like this [[ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱]], the entire world could watch me, and I would just beg to relieve myself of the agony. Go on, [[/b/]], hit the walls! Just get it out.
