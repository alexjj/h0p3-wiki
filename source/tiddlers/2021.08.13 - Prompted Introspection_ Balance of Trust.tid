title: 2021.08.13 - Prompted Introspection: Balance of Trust

!! Which group is larger: people who trust you, or people you trust?

I don't know the answer.

What is [[trust|Trusting Trust]] again? If it merely that I feel confident in my predictions of their motivations and behaviors, or even that I am successfully accurate in such an endeavor, then I do trust the majority of people I encounter in a wide variety of manners and contexts. I do have some models of people's minds that are sufficiently effective to my eyes. I have to figure out which rules people are following as an autist, a problem Saint Wittgenstein knew all too well. And, here, we find the real leaps of [[faith]] in [[the other]] that extend beyond the positivist, amoral, valueless, unmystically computed sense. You mean to ask me if I trust people to be [[good]], right?

I wager it's between [0.003-3.000%] of the species above the age of 25. I have a much more difficult time gauging anyone below that mark. I have met plenty of radically evil children in my time, but I also [[aim]] to be charitable in my interpretation. We might be sitting at a 50/50 mark here (and, I wager the ratio of under-25's to over-25's one has met is much higher for me than the average person). I suppose I've a trust by "how much" in mind. Into the blackhole beyond my S2 cognition, it is rare that I encounter people I instinctively, tacitly, and almost effortlessly trust all the way down. I'm talking, maybe a dozen homo sapiens. 

Lastly, you have the opportunity to explore other [[dok]] persons with me here (wielding coherentist definitions of [[good]] and personhood I've found among many celebrated elite female philosophers), and you may even consider imaginary examples as viable candidates (e.g. [[WWDD]]). I do not know, or there may even be an infinite number. I trust those who seek to bind themselves with the CI for the sake of it being the CI. I do not know the answer, but you know my guess. Perhaps cutting what is [[salient]] from the the block is a continuum hypothesis adjacent problem.
