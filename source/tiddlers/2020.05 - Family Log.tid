!! Audit:

* This has become a rockstar for me. I lurv it. Who knew that the missing ingredient was this collection of paragraphs? Lol.
** It's befitting of a [[Root User]] now.
* It's sad to see my wife's unhappiness with GISH.
* The adults are once again feeling the heat. 
* [[TTP]]s have been a nightmare. It's one of those things that prison systems for children actually teach, though in a passive aggressive rather than autonomy-inducing manner, that we haven't done nearly well enough. 
** It's been the source of outright brawls for months. 2019 had a ton of failure in it. My offspring do not work without me forcing them to do it. We have to keep trying to help these birds fly.
* The quarantine and my wife's injury has curled us up even more. 
** The offspring go outside for an hour each day + chores. That's it. 
** I feel like our online relationships have spread into more random folks but also that we have clearly met a wall of [[intimacy]] with most that we know well. 
*** There's the asymmetry. Reading and writing is so expensive. We practice this thing that most would not execute or would find torturous. 
**** Sometimes, I think the way in which to overcome the vertigo of postmodernism is to down in the overload from the beginning. 
* We are lucky to be able to engage in this. It's hard work, but it gets easier in many ways too. I'm glad that we look forward to at least parts of [[Family Time]] together, and I'm grateful that we stick it out for the shitty parts too.
