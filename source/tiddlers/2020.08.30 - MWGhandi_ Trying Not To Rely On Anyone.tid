title: 2020.08.30 - MWGhandi: Trying Not To Rely On Anyone

"""
Did you end up having a fun Saturday-Monday with your dude? How's your week been?
Aug 28 2:11pm
It’s actually been an odd turn of events
Aug 30 6:56pm
I spent last weekend by myself but then I went to Knoxville to hang with a guy I’ve been talking to so that was good
Aug 30 6:57pm
However now for the next two weeks I’m house sitting/cat sitting at my employers house
Aug 30 6:57pm
Until sept 13th
Aug 30 6:57pm
Sounds like a chance to chill or a chance to focus (or both).
Aug 30 6:58pm
Image attached to message
I brought my dog to work on Friday and he’ll be with me until they get back so that’s cool
Aug 30 6:57pm
=D
Aug 30 6:58pm
However I went on this date with a new dude and after spending all night with him and this morning he said that he doesn’t think we are compatible?’
Aug 30 6:58pm
Even though I think we had fun and it was a chill evening
Aug 30 6:58pm
I am not going to ask for clarity from him though because let’s be frank if you spend one evening with me and it’s not your vibe then bye
Aug 30 6:59pm
Yeah I’m trying to focus on me during this time but it’s been awhile since I’ve been all alone so learning to be with me is quite a lot to overcome
Aug 30 7:00pm
I at least wrote my impact statement for [[REDACTED]]'s sentencing
Aug 30 7:00pm
Next is my contract for my employers
Aug 30 7:00pm
Then printing off all the documentation for divorce
Aug 30 7:00pm
His opinion does not appear to have enough evidence necessary to formulate a justified perspective worth your time and energy here. I am glad that you have the chance to cut your losses early.
Aug 30 7:01pm
Yeah but what’s odd is it went well and somehow it feels too soon to make that distinction tbh
Aug 30 7:02pm
It takes time to grow the kind of love that listens. I have no idea how to seek or cultivate that effectively enough. I'm often a blind man here.
Aug 30 7:02pm
Also my employers house is worth 500,000 dollars so it’s like a paid vacay lol
Aug 30 7:03pm
What I truly don’t understand is he was a pretty chill and cool guy
Aug 30 7:03pm
But I’m not trying to think much about it
Aug 30 7:03pm
k
Aug 30 7:04pm
He apparently was being false
Aug 30 7:04pm
Dude, a vacation sounds fantastic. You should chill. Recuperate. Been through hell.
Aug 30 7:04pm
Yeah I know
Aug 30 7:04pm
It is possible that he was unjustifiably deceptive. I don't know.
Aug 30 7:05pm
Yeah I guess
Aug 30 7:05pm
It’s just unfortunate
Aug 30 7:05pm
Haha he at least understood divorce hahah
Aug 30 7:06pm
Since he’s been through one
Aug 30 7:06pm
He was also kinda old
Aug 30 7:06pm
8 years older
Aug 30 7:06pm
It will be very important for you to know that I'm a relatively paranoid person in some respects. I have an extremely skeptical view of the intentions of most people. You are listening to a crazy person; I appreciate that you do, btw.
Aug 30 7:06pm
Haha valid
Aug 30 7:07pm
;P
Aug 30 7:07pm
I just want to be healthy without a human needing me tbh
Aug 30 7:07pm
I get that.
Aug 30 7:07pm
However I’m having trouble with the lifestyle I got use to ha
Aug 30 7:08pm
Although that dude did say how refreshing is that I can focus on the positives and think of the future after what I’ve gone through
Aug 30 7:09pm
You are very resourceful. I admire how hard you work to do the right things in life.
Aug 30 7:09pm
I try my best
Aug 30 7:10pm
I see that. Yes, ma'am.
Aug 30 7:10pm
Thanks I’m really trying to not rely on anyone again
Aug 30 7:10pm
Which makes a relationship hard
Aug 30 7:10pm
No doubt.
Aug 30 7:10pm
Since I believe [[REDACTED]] has too much power over me
Aug 30 7:11pm
Which left me vulnerable
Aug 30 7:11pm
The best relationship I have now is with the bathtub and running with my pup no offense to talking to you
Aug 30 7:13pm
Sometimes I just like to hide
Aug 30 7:13pm
Yup.
Aug 30 7:13pm
I just think some of these dudes think they have life sorted out and meet me and they are like wow maybe I don’t but instead of say that they say umm we won’t work
Aug 30 7:14pm
Like come on....
Aug 30 7:14pm
How are you all?
Aug 30 7:14pm
We are doing well enough. [[k0sh3k]] heads back to the worksite this week. She's been working hard for it, and there are many steps ahead for her. We realize we might be moving again here in a few month. Lots to think about. Offspring are doing my wife's selected schoolwork well enough, but they've done little of my work sadly. I've been depressed this week, and my sleep schedule has been very erratic. It's been a relatively chill week though. We got enough done.
Aug 30 7:26pm
We've been thinking about the state of world a lot. That has been expensive to think and feel about.
Aug 30 7:27pm
Ah where are y’all moving?
Aug 30 7:29pm
Closer, maybe. Cheaper, hopefully.
Aug 30 7:29pm
As well as I’m sorry to hear about all that
Aug 30 7:29pm
Oh closer to campus?
Aug 30 7:29pm
The dream would be walking distance, lol. Even when cars don't work, can still get onsite.
Aug 30 7:30pm
Oh that’s reasonable
