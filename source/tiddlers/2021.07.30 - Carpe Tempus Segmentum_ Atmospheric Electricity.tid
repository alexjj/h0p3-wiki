title: 2021.07.30 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Atmospheric Electricity

Chatting with [[anon]]s, or trying to anyway. Not many have a vocation in which they tell their own story; I should be more [[grateful]] for the opportunity. How many people get to do this because they should? [[TTTOTW]], more time walking than anything. Fireman Time! Attempted sleep by 6.

Woke at 11:30. It was shitty half-brained sleep. Awful. I can eat that though. Sleep plenty as it is. Stomach turning into knots. Anxiety. Yup. Been here a thousand times, will be here another times. On with it, man. Long meditation. Fireman Time!

Lightning Struck! 

[[Morning Routine]]. Hugs'n'bugs. 

Spoke with Neighbor Joe about his plants. Milkweed, sunflowers. Digging up dead things. He has a very high-pitched voice, bordering on maybe vocal chord damage. I'm doing a shit job of connecting. He asked me what I was up to. It's hard to describe what I'm up to, homie. I can't tell if his hearing is significantly impaired or if he's skilled at ignoring (or both); he is old, and he's a lifelong woodworker (so my bet is hearing impaired). We may have had a disagreement about the rising temperatures of the area. He may be more conservative than I would guess; this area tends to be.

//The Walk// with my offspring. Vapelyfe. She's solving her cube while we walk. [[Rubik's Cube]] was something she actually used. Shit for school. Okay. Trying to convince them to speak with the guy refinishing a wood chair (but they turn the opportunity down). Rabbitholing. My son spoke less than usual today.

//Foundation// @ 4:02:22 con mijos. Didn't get to go the distance today. The cool kids have decided that "wenis" is the word to inject into all things today. I appreciate that. They continue to develop theories, and I cannot answer. My daughter continues to pick out too many holes and makes too many predictions. I'm going into full "lalalalalalalalalalalalalalala, I can't hear you" mode. This only encourages further inquiry. Good. They don't like that I won't try to answer their questions. Hehe.

[[5c0ut]] messaged me. Tears. He needs sleep, bad. Everyone's sleeping like shit lately. Wtf is happening? Too many people I know aren't sleeping well this week; it's well above average. Also, he's thinking about W-Entity's help with school; that's a damned good idea. I think he would strongly appreciate it too. Oh, then [[specialist]] and the flood. -=[ Rabbitholed ]=-. Tears. Dance.<<ref "k">> 

Moar Lightning!

She came down, glasses tinted, hugs. [[TTTOTW]]. //Skintime// and making out. My extremely highly extra super dooper logical arguments failed.<<ref "a">> =(. Still, dope. A Viewing Party + Fireman Time! Cleaning. [[TTTOTW]]. 

[[Family Gathering]]. Hugs with [[5c0ut]]. Showed us his cakes today (made 8 and some cupcakes). One in particular stood out; it was like an impressionist oil painting, trippy, worth zooming into (I think I like it way more than he did...I would classify it as fine art, but, ofc, I don't know anything about art). Don't know what technique he used. My offspring made dinner again for us. We had a leak in our ziplock back for the meat, but they recovered a nice red sauce with veggies, penne, eggplant (aubergine is so much fancier a word ;P) cooked really nicely, and some watermelon (it never gets old...I took half of it lmao!...they made sure to come get some off my plate though). We watched //Arrested Development//. It's almost over. =(. I don't have many more shows that come close (she already knows everything anyway, blah blah blah). My daughter has been teasing me non-stop today. It's dope.

Nap. Woke at 11. Reminded my daughter that she's gotta be asleep by 2, son by 1. [[TTTOTW]]. Thunder!<<ref "m">> [[TTTOTW]]+LolVod.
