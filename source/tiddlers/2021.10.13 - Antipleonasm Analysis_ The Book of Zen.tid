title: 2021.10.13 - Antipleonasm Analysis: The Book of Zen

!! Respond to [[the following|Why Not A Wide Area Network, Watson?]]:

<<<
If you really understand zen...you can use any book. You could use the Bible or Alice in Wonderland. You could use the dictionary, because...the sound of the rain needs no translation.

Zendeepity of Psychonetic Pure Meaning.<<ref "p">>

Use these books for what? [[gfwiwcgws]]? [[FTSO]][[W5H]]? Even if your antecedent were true, the more important issue at stake is: which books are more [[salient]] to our contexts? 

Your claim is so Romantic.<<ref "r">> Why should I think the sound of rain needs no translation? I get that you aim to perceive a flattened world (it is all one book) to justify the self-worship of your limbic system as though it were the universe itself, but what makes you think there is any perception of the sound of rain (let alone what is [[salient]] about it, insofar as that can even be peeled apart) without transduction, translation, a modeling, and an interpretation? Now, you can might want to say these representations aren't like natural language symbols, but that is not so obvious to me at the Zen level either. 

One might interpret you to be saying that if you already understand everything that matters, you can use any perspective as a gateway to the rest. That might be true, and it tells us something about the nature of wisdom and The World, but it's not all that useful in some respects (nobody has attained such a thing, and it cannot be attained to some [[dok]]). I am reminded of the "touch grass" meme a bit too. 

Lastly, I'm reminded of those who have compared my ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 to The Library of Babel (as well as the Tower of Babel). We the [[fff]] are faced with the neverending task of understanding the ideal virtuous agents' perceptions of what is [[salient]]. So, I leave you with this olive branch, my friend, as I think there is something here that may be of interest to us both in this context:

<<<
In my opinion, of course, there is nothing in the universe of created things that does not need the concept of every other thing in the universe for its perfect concept, since each thing influences every other in such a way that, if it were imagined that that thing were removed or different, everything in the world would be different from what it is now. 

-- Saint Leibniz, writing to Burchard de Volder
