"""
[1:47 PM] h0p3: How's it going?
[2:00 PM] Sohalia: Not too shabby. Managing to stave off cabin fever somehow, mostly from help with [[K]] and our semi-frequent walks. Been indulging in WAY more video games than usual too, which has been very fun. How about you?
[2:01 PM] h0p3: Sick.
[2:02 PM] h0p3: I'm glad to hear you've been able to walk and half fun. Staving it off aint easy.
[2:02 PM] Sohalia: Oh goodness... have things not gotten any better for you? :disappointed_relieved:
[2:03 PM] h0p3: Oh, no!
[2:03 PM] h0p3: I meant the "good" kind of sick, for you, lol
[2:03 PM] h0p3: no, I'm all fine.
[2:03 PM] Sohalia: Oh xD
[2:04 PM] Sohalia: Yeah, it’s a good thing [[K]] and I honestly love each other. I’m pretty sure we would have strangled each other by now if we didn’t lol
[2:05 PM] h0p3: No doubt. Being cooped up with folks long-term probably distills which people enjoy being together and which don't.
[2:05 PM] h0p3: For some, I think this has almost been like a vacation, in part.
[2:08 PM] h0p3: I'm doing well enough. Grinding along.
[2:11 PM] Sohalia: I see you all are poking around on the discord — it’s nice to get a peek into your buzz of activity
[2:12 PM] Sohalia: It’s good to hear you’re doing well. Run into anything fun or weird lately?
[2:13 PM] h0p3: Uh, yes. Lots of things. Not sure what to pick out for ya.
[2:14 PM] h0p3: https://philosopher.life/#Recipe%3A%20PBJ%20Sandwich
[2:14 PM] Sohalia: Hehehe, sounds like I need to do some more snooping on your site :eyes:
[2:14 PM] h0p3: Did this with the kids yesterday. Had them write up a recipe. I followed it literally, was hilarious
[2:16 PM] h0p3: Talking to the founder of https://getaether.net/ (p2p reddit) about what I think it should look like: https://philosopher.life/#P2P%3A%20Aether
[2:17 PM] h0p3: [[BDS97]] has recommended I write science fiction (https://philosopher.life/#2020.04.08%20-%20BDS97%3A%20Sci-fi)
[2:17 PM] h0p3: Pretty worried about these: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22828691 and https://www.lynalden.com/global-dollar-short-squeeze/
[2:18 PM] h0p3: Finishing up my kintsukuroi for DeathOfRobinhood's wedding gift.
[2:20 PM] h0p3: Been working on time management with the kids: https://philosopher.life/#.tmpl:.tmpl%20.tdl%20.plan.
[2:21 PM] h0p3: https://philosopher.life/#BAGD%3A%20%CE%A6%CE%B9%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%83%CE%BF%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE%20%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%AC%CE%BB%CF%85%CF%83%CE%B7.tmpl has been soaking up our time. Extremely expensive.
[2:23 PM] h0p3: The Link Log continues to pick out what I think is fun, weird, or important too: https://philosopher.life/#2020.04.07%20-%20Link%20Log%3A%20A%20Single%20Window
[2:24 PM] Sohalia: Lots of shiny links to poke
[2:24 PM] Sohalia: I dig it — I will dive in when I need a break
[2:25 PM] Sohalia: Something I realized about your site: It’s almost like reading someone’s diary for all their juicy secrets. Except I don’t have to break into your locker, you’re literally handing it to me and saying “it’s there if you want to read it.” And instead of juicy secrets, it’s just all of your thoughts typed out on a page.
[2:25 PM] h0p3: Yes! :slight_smile:
[2:25 PM] Sohalia: It’s fun
[2:27 PM] Sohalia: The level of vulnerability and transparency is difficult to find.
[2:27 PM] h0p3: I'm a madman. Lol.
[2:27 PM] Sohalia: Also, your random toilet humor is hilarious
[2:27 PM] Sohalia: I guess it’s not even all toilet humor either
[2:27 PM] h0p3: Some of the best of the toilet humor: https://philosopher.life/#Smelting%20Muh%20Silly%20Farts%3A%20%F0%93%82%BA
[2:28 PM] Sohalia: “Haha here’s a funny recipe about PB&J and also a penis tag please enjoy”
[2:28 PM] h0p3: lol, yup
[2:28 PM] h0p3: Gotta have some absurd, silly bullshit for my life's work.
[2:30 PM] Sohalia: A mountain of serious, thought provoking  discussion with a heap of gigglesnort
[2:31 PM] h0p3: Gigglesnort sounds like a wacky designer drug name, lol. Take a hit!
[2:32 PM] Sohalia: Shhh, don’t give away my secrets :eyes:
