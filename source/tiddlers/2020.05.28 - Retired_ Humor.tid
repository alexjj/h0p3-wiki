title: 2020.05.28 - Retired: Humor

//As my wife points out, I'm permanently 12 years old.//

Though they tend to be damaged, sociopathic, and intuitive sophists, all too often comedians are philosophers or priests of a sort. I think of jesters as slightly more articulate and well-intentioned magicians. They often see the cracks in society and in ourselves. I can't remember or deliver a joke to save my life, so I'm glad other people in the world do it for me. They can help us laugh about what we fear and don't understand; sometimes humor is the only constructive response to absurdity. It is a sign of submission. I need to giggle and wheeze, so I catalog and preserve some humor.
