title: 2020.12.11 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Wherein I Confirm My Utter Retardation, Yet Again

** Son's MUC +1, +1 vs Goblins. We sorted by function and talked about it. It's been a long time since we talked about Goblins. They remember bits of it (still one of the best decks to learn the game with). 100 more games of that, and he'll get it, I think. Once you've mastered one matchup, it becomes easier to learn what it means to master others.
** Son's MUC vs Burn. Slow-rolled around spike, drew out counters instead of discarding down, draw-go until inevitable alpha strike. Lots of discussion about the game states and why it was playing out as it did (it's rare for something to play draw-go against draw-go like this). Went so hyperconservative that I had 3 alpha-strikes sitting in my hand.
* [[JRE]] Called
** Marriage/Menage
** Meds give him vivid dreams and stronger memories of them. Lucid too. EQ and nuclear bunker.
** They've maybe missed some calls that might be from the biomom through an agency. No messages, and no way to know for sure.
** Video chat
*** Matthew is lookin' extra cute in his dad's lap. He belongs there, and he knows it.
*** He waves at my son. =D. My offspring got to meet their cousin. 
*** Showed my brother around the house. He likes it too. 
**** Suggested a cheap way to handle the attic, when the time comes.
**** He appreciates a lived-in home.
* Noodles, coffee
* Offspring and I put together the wardrobe. Cheap parts, but it's sturdy. Hard to put together sometimes as the plasticish-cloth shelving cannot be stretched at all (I bet it could hold my body weight, tensile). 
** It was not meant for colorblind people. My daughter directed us, and we did the strength work. 
** I ended up cutting myself from the slips (lots of unavoidable sheering force) on the fittings.
* Washer and dryer delivery
** Guys were cool enough. They were rough dudes, but I tried to give 'em a break, bathroom, etc. before they left. 
** I can see their business revolves around delivery+taking old pieces to be fixed up. Nice.
** Dryer test went great.
* Unpacking
* Went to put together a desk. The dimensions I had expected were incorrect. It's only 20" deep. 24" is minimum, and I want 30". I'm disappointed. That was going to be it for me. The desk I'm using now has lasted for a decade (and it sucks for my legs and chair). 
** However, my wife needs one for an office, and this is one just right (it was originally somewhat too deep for her, but now it isn't). 
* Errands + Date
** Home Depot closes before we can get there, so we hit Lowes. They have the waterlines I need. Looked at welding machines, and they were simply too expensive for my taste.
*** Saw our washer and dryer new for 3 times the price we paid. 
** Got my wife's coffee. The one in walking distance of our previous place is still the closest to us. Interesting.
** Pokebowls. We sat in the car and ate. It was delightful.
** I suppose I'm going to get used to the way back eventually. 
** W-Entity
*** We got a dessert, a bathtub mat (since it is slippery enough), a rockbottom table and paddles (I've got my smooth, but thin because I need to compensate for lack of control).
*** The lady with killer nails and huge tits spoke with me again today. She seems to go out of her way to be nice to me. She allowed us to name the price on the untagged rug for my son's desk area (it said $12 on the label where we found it) so he won't damage the floor. 
* What May Be An Expensive Mistake
** I quickly pop everything onto the washing machine, throw a load of laundry in to test the washing machine, and it's working. Dope. So, I run upstairs to play magic with muh family.
** We eat dessert and swing cards
*** [[MTG]]
**** Son's MUC vs Daughter's Affinity, each take one. Saw my daughter clamp out the game against him (she was ahead the entire time).
**** Wife's Paci +3 vs Dredge, never had an engine, turn 3 win. Second game I had double LED, Iona (again).
** We were about to fix up a table for ping pong, and then my daughter saw what happened downstairs: a flood. Toward [[m16]]'s corner, there was at least an inch (the floor is not even). Cheap, old particle board furniture got hit, as did my fresh sheets and problematically my mattress. 
*** I immediately realized my fuckup. Water goes out, retard! 
**** Here's why I think it didn't strike me (even though it should have): there is no water-out for the washer down here. wat. That's something I obviously should have recognized, but it just didn't occur to me. Too happy to move on to fun things to pay attention. `/facepalm`. 
*** I'm glad that I have played by my rules of not running wire along or leaving electronics on the floor. If [[m16]] got hit, I'd be devastated. 
*** I have the coolest family. Everyone jumped into action. Everyone has worked hard today, and it's late, and they didn't give AF. We had to solve this right now, and they did so with a kind of playfulness even (not letting me feel ashamed about it either). Found devices for scooping, had our tubs, brought out all the towels we needed to wash anyway, finalized the job with the blankets I had just washed anyway. We move everything, clean the bottoms of the furniture. Roughly 20 gallons on the floor judging by the tubs. 
**** I apologized until they stopped saying "it's not a problem" and my daughter said: "you are forgiven, if that will make you feel better, but it's not a problem."
*** Set up fans, and we're gonna try to rescue the mattress.
* Round 2
** So, I figured out what the old owners did: they ran the water-out straight into the utility sink. I found their jury-rigged mount point for the hose, and I used their hose for it (extra long). I liked the clamp on mine, but it wouldn't make it to the sink even after getting the washer close (I strongly prefer washer and dryer side-by-side though). 
** This time, I stay for the test. Moment of truth comes, and I hear a pop and then a water rushing. Unpowered the machine, called for help, and held the water back from reaching my corner. 
*** I needed to use the real clamp on the end-point. I don't know how the older owners got away with it.
** We're, like, pros at dealing with my retardations at this point. Just 5 minutes of work to undo the damage.
*** Although, I'm glad our floor got cleaned. It's dirty. 
* Round 3
** We used my hose and theirs this time. 
*** Figured out why they've got the 2-by-4 stretched ridiculously across the face of the utility sink: it holds the hose upright. 
*** I think this feels like how I use Loonix. I get it working, and I don't touch it, pray to the gods that nothing breaks, and if it does, fuck it, it was garbage anyway, lol.
** So, [[The Asylum.tdl]] included an off-the-cuff desire to fix the utility sink (the left sink is disconnected), nobody has actually used PVC cement on this piece, and the piping is jank AF (actually, even the brass is old school and thrown together by an amateur who couldn't be bothered to measure or plan). It can work though. It's not mandatory to fix it sooner.
*** I discovered this round that the sink, when it's filled too quickly, wants to overflow out of the disconnected side. Because I need dry and clean towels, blankets, etc. asap, I've brought a tub in to hold the PVC piping in place for now. I discovered that it runs into the main sewage line, and //that// Tee fitting is loose. Holy shit. I secured it by hand, but I can see I need to build my own solution now (there's a leak there too that we didn't see until after a washer cycle). This is not to be trusted. 
**** This is something the inspector and I should have seen. I would have asked for that to be fixed, but I'm glad this is something I can fix (even if not ideally because I'm a fitter, not a plumber [I work with real pipe, unlike these savages]). 
* Round 4
** It works. I'm looking at what the previous owner did, and I kind of admire that level of laziness/resourcefulness (a mixture, I think). Just don't keep anything valuable on the floor. It does have that old-timey shop feel to it.
* Read+Write+//GoT//

I had been thinking about flooding and even talking about it today. At least I get to see a very small one in action. The day had its ups and downs (mostly my own stupidity proven to me yet again). Overall, it was really good. I enjoyed being with my family.
