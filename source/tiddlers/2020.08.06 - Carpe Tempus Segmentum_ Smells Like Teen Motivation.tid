title: 2020.08.06 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Smells Like Teen Motivation

* Woke at noon
** Actually felt rested. Woot! =)
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Having my offspring clean their rooms...
** Abject failure
* 2-in-1 encouragement
** Abject failure
* Learned there were much more significant power outages (not just the number of people, but the number of hours). There was no refrigerated/frozen section at Aldi. 
** I'm surprised. Maybe it's a policy issue here.
* Dialectures
** Motivation
** Expression was expensive all around.
** I had worried that my daughter wasn't emotional enough, but that is clearly not the case. 
** We will continue to try to figure out how to draw lines.
* The Walk
** Saw Alex today. He seemed pretty chill. He got a picture of his neighbors car bashed in by a tree, and he's been out in the world trying to take pictures. He's been listening to popular music.
*** He complimented my hypertext. He he offered me high praise, saying I was poet. 
** The trail was cleaner today.
** My wife work has so many moving pieces.
*** She saw ahead on B's rejection, and anticipated CK's possible objections. The former she worked on the object that was needed and had it ready for the chain in advance (well handled), and the latter she solved in the policy creation (it's obvious that she pays attention to what the union requires).
** I forget too much. Lol.
*** Oh, we discussed why we aren't too concerned about forgetting it. We know it does modify us still.
*** Oh, bump in chance that she'll be split between work and home. Mixed feelings about this. Ideally, she'd have that flexibility, but that is not really how this position goes.
* Offspring made dinner. 
** Didn't need no man, didn't want no man.
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Brats, sprouts, apples
** [[k0sh3k]] called the audible for //Dominion//
*** My son and I tied. =). I was a turn ahead, but last on the rounds. Reminds me of "you have to beat the champion" concept.
* LoL
* Read+Write
* Fireman Time!
* Read+Write
* Sleep by 4:30
