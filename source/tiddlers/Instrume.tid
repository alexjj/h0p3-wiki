Hello. I've been thinking about your words. I would like to know what you think I should think and feel about those in power in China vs how I should think and feel about the average Chinese person.

My name is h0p3. I have a very odd site, https://philosopher.life/.

In some respects, I interview people as I get to know them.

I would be lucky to understand your point of view.

Counter-question: should Socrates have been made to drink hemlock?

[[h0p3]] 
3:15 PM

=)

No.

It was a murder, an unjustified taking of a person's life.

[[Instrume]] 
11:18 PM

Sort of more complicated than that.

Socrates, first, was offending the traditions of the city that kept the city together and functioning. Second, Socrates, from apparent reports, was literally asking for it; he had a lot of options to get out of it, but he specifically chose a course of action that maximized his chances of death.

[[h0p3]] 
11:46 PM

Are you going to say it wasn't murder?

We can talk about who was responsible for Socrates having been made to drink hemlock.

And, I'm open to the claim that he has a non-trivial hand in his own murder.

You don't have a counterpoint yet, but you are trying to flesh out the complexity. I admire that.

As to the actual event (and perhaps this is where you are really trying to go), I'll agree we are reliant upon the accounts of others. Problematically, it seems unwise to be too confident in any model of historical Socrates. That may be pertinent to the reason I reached out to you.

I'm very glad that you take wisdom and story-telling seriously. It is a moral matter.

Today
[[Instrume]] 
12:37 AM

Define murder.

Murder is defined as illegal killing. To the best of my understanding, the trial that killed Socrates was legal within the context of the city.

Oh no, regarding Socrates

the point is more that cities (societies for that matter) have their own logic and "self-nature"

just as people do and there's a contradiction between them.

It's also a question of concepts of identity or concepts of self; i.e, the problem of other minds as well.

One of the solutions is to evade the question of consciousness altogether and deprivilege what's believed to a "human' consciousness marked by qualia, and treat it as entirely arbitrary.

[[h0p3]] 
12:45 AM

I already did define it for you. I try to choose my words carefully, so I ask you to read them carefully.

And, I'm sure we can find lots of different definitions of murder held by lots of people. I posit, however, that murder is a moral crime, not merely a juridical one. Say, for example, it was not "illegal" to kill a Jew in WWII. On your definition, killing a random Jew is not murder. Obviously, it is murder.

Moral != Legal

Look at your original question. I answered it effectively.

Note the difference between describing the norms, mores, and conventions of a society and prescribing them. Further, note the difference between mere rule-following of the laws legislated, enforced, and adjudicated given the almost useless legal positivist's concept of a government (Nazi governments are governments, they just aren't justified governments) and following a universal, categorical imperative (which, of course, requires context and particularization).

So, I agree that cities have their own logics and essences even. That such a thing //is// the case does not mean it //ought// to be the case. Normativity that is actually normative does not arise from merely these facts. So, while your point fleshed out some complexity to the context, you've not offered a counterpoint (I already defined murder for you, remember).

I agree there are contradictions and contraries between all non-identical objects in the world. I agree that people have opposing perspectives, systems of thought, memeplexes, signaling, and that even their physical bodies (setting aside even the problem of their minds) hold lots of contradictory dialectical relationships that run much deeper and with greater complexity than any finite mind can compute. I understand that I'm asking you to sum up an enormous problem in just a few short words. Yes, I aim to be charitable and thorough.

I agree that the problems of identity and other minds are serious questions here too. I agree that I cannot give complete answers to any of your questions, nor you mine. I trust you to do your best. I still do. I am grateful that you are trying to be very careful in speaking with me.

That is a rhetorical and realpolitik solution to another kind of problem, but it is not a solution to the problems at hand.

[[h0p3]] 
1:21 AM

Maybe there is a book we can read together. //Spheres of Justice//. It highlights a crucial problem that you're picking out for us. I admire Walzer's position (which has more force to it than most moral philosophers would want to admit). Resolving fundamental disagreement fairly is a crucial topic to me.

What do you think consists in fairness?

[[Instrume]] 
1:41 AM

noun: murder; plural noun: murders

    the unlawful premeditated killing of one human being by another.

i.e, socrates was not murdered by the Athenian city-state

his forced suicide was legal

In The Trial of Socrates (1988), I. F. Stone argued that Socrates wanted to be sentenced to death, to justify his philosophic opposition to the Athenian democracy of that time, and because, as a man, he saw that old age would be an unpleasant time for him.

that's a oft proposed position

i.e, he deliberately botched his defense in such a way as to guarantee his death

remember, there's a philosophical vein that doubts socrates, or rather how plato depicted him, and denigrates his assumptions and conclusions

[[h0p3]] 
2:02 AM

Why should we take up that definition of murder? You aren't addressing what I said.

Suicide can be murder, and even if we were to agree that he alone was responsible, my answer is still correct. You still don't have a counterpoint.

I don't have a problem with doubting Plato's depictions of Socrates here. I don't think you are reading his work correctly if you don't. It's okay that we disagree with Socrates™ too. He was surely wrong about many things.

[[Instrume]] 
2:13 AM

You're choosing a definition of murder that's at odds with the socially-accepted definition of murder.

[[h0p3]] 
2:13 AM

We do that sometimes in philosophy.

[[Instrume]] 
2:13 AM

The point regarding Socrates not having been murdered is a question of technical truth, as opposed to historiography of Socrates as a martyr

[[h0p3]] 
2:13 AM

But, I think that careful examination will demonstrate that my clarification is reasonable (I have quite a bit of experience thinking about the concept of murder with people who are legitimately trying to think with me about it).

[[Instrume]] 
2:14 AM

To deconstruct the concept, it's both a concept as a social response.

''''*and a social response.

For example, murder is distinguished for killing.

We kill, if not vegan, animals all the time, but don't consider it killing. If vegan, we usually kill bugs all the time while driving, but don't consider it murder either.

The line "meat is murder" uses the terminology precisely for that reason.

[[h0p3]] 
2:16 AM

I would say we "kill" animals, but they aren't persons (which is why we don't call it murder, usually - though there are perhaps non-human creatures that count as Dasein or are moral agents that have the dignity of personhood).

[[Instrume]] 
2:16 AM

Once again, in bringing up Socrates, my angle is more to make the case both for and against executing Socrates simultaneously.

Once again, isn't the definition of "persons" wholly arbitrary?

[[h0p3]] 
2:16 AM

Why should we think that?

[[Instrume]] 
2:17 AM

I recall a philosophy class once, and I'm still kicking myself for not putting a more fun definition of human

[[h0p3]] 
2:17 AM

Also, I'm not saying there's no case to made for Socrates' execution (especially if it is merely a myth), but it isn't an overriding reason.

[[Instrume]] 
2:18 AM

that is to say, it's socially construed, abu ghraib prisoners aren't human, because otherwise why would they get tortured, but once the tortured prisoners' story gets out on the media

they're seen with compassion and the treatment receives some degree of outrage, therefore they're human

personage is sociall construed and not essential

[[h0p3]] 
2:18 AM

Why should I think that?

[[Instrume]] 
2:20 AM

once again, we seem to be talking about a social definition as opposed to a personal or specific definition

[[h0p3]] 
2:20 AM

I agree that interpretations of the concept are constructed to a non-trivial degree, but that doesn't mean there's not an objective concept or essence that is relevant.

[[Instrume]] 
2:20 AM

it seems reasonable considering observed human behavior, both individual and social

are you having fun, btw?

if not, I can stop

[[h0p3]] 
2:21 AM

I don't think you've addressed what I've said carefully at each stage. I don't think that's fun. But, I am glad to speak with you.

I appreciate your giving me perspective into your philosophical beliefs too.

[[Instrume]] 
2:22 AM

In part, that's because we seem to have different ontologies, and i'm attacking your ontology. I suppose you could assume that's in bad faith.

[[h0p3]] 
2:22 AM

That will be crucial for trying to understand how you respond to my original request.

[[Instrume]] 
2:22 AM

And well, TBH, most political discussions ARE ontological discussions.

What is often is predicate-like, not based on theorems and logic.

[[h0p3]] 
2:23 AM

I'm not sure what isn't an ontological discussion. But, that isn't what I take to be bad faith about your argumentation.

[[Instrume]] 
2:23 AM

But in this case I'm specifying deeper assumptions, like whether (or more importantly, how) murder exists

or whether personhood is essential or incidental

[[h0p3]] 
2:23 AM

I admire your skepticism.

[[Instrume]] 
2:24 AM

I'm sufficiently a pyrrhonist to doubt pyrrho and condemn socrates to death :)

[[h0p3]] 
2:24 AM

That's quite a position to believe you hold.

[[Instrume]] 
2:24 AM

If I'm a pyrrhonist, I can't hold a position, can I? But neither can I not hold a position? :)

[[h0p3]] 
2:24 AM

It's delightful.

[[Instrume]] 
2:25 AM

Well, when you mentioned philosophy, I was thinking ##philosophy on freenode sucks.

And thought, here's my chance

[[h0p3]] 
2:25 AM

Lol. Yes, I appreciate that. It's hard to have a serious philosophical discussion in most cases.

Your account makes more sense to me. Thank you for clarifying.

[[Instrume]] 
2:27 AM

Well, if we're going to be friendly with each other, want me to discuss Chinese government vs Chinese people, etc?

Without playing dumb ontological games?

I.e, go from philosophy to sociology

[[h0p3]] 
2:27 AM

I have all the information I need. Thank you.

[[Instrume]] 
2:27 AM

Awww. :(

I apologize, though, if I am coming off with bad faith. I'm treating our discourse (or more discourses in general) as "language games", or taking a Zhuangzian position on argumentation.

The act of accepting or refusing a position can be in good or bad faith, but it's volitional.

[[h0p3]] 
2:31 AM

I will agree it is a language game, though not merely a language game. I am fine with a lack of certainty, and I appreciate that sometimes probabilistic inference is the best we can achieve in some domains.

[[Instrume]] 
2:31 AM

The goal, rather, is whether it brings delight or enligtenment to the participants, even if the enlightenment isn't the one either party desires.

[[h0p3]] 
2:32 AM

I agree that doxastic involuntarism obtains, and I agree that there are cases in which taking up and leaving positions can be volitional (including in the Frankfurtian sense).

[[Instrume]] 
2:32 AM

Or, in other words, philosophical debates should be like play, between friends who are pretending to be kids again, and play is how chlidren learn.

[[h0p3]] 
2:33 AM

Sometimes. Often. Preferably, perhaps.

[[Instrume]] 
2:33 AM

How do you disagree ,then? I'm a relativist who doubts certainty, but you seem to have more of a belief in inviolable truths.

Implicitly, with your claim regarding Socrates' murder, you're taking a side as to whether he should or should not have been killed, i.e, he's a martyr to free inquiry and free thought.

[[h0p3]] 
2:34 AM

I'm not convinced that is the goal, but I don't see how you can defend or define any goal here.

That was not my claim.

[[Instrume]] 
2:34 AM

I apologize for misinterpreting you, then.

So perhaps you feel that the death penalty is tautologically murder?

Well, if you want my position on things, and why I brought up Socrates

Societies have rights, or rather "自然" / naturalness, their inherent tendencies, which are often described by social sciences. I don't think it's necessarily right to privilege individual rights against social rights, but rather admit a sense of tension between them.

In other words, the position that Socrates is right to question and to commit what Athenians decided to be the crime of impiety is not irreconcilable with Athens' choice to put him to death.

[[h0p3]] 
2:38 AM

Are you a fan of Object Oriented Ontology?

[[Instrume]] 
2:38 AM

I'm not familiar with the concept, but it sounds fascinating. I suppose it's on Stanford Plato?

[[h0p3]] 
2:39 AM

It might be something that you'd find interesting for your position.

[[Instrume]] 
2:39 AM

Or would I need Jstor?

Heh.

[[h0p3]] 
2:39 AM

If you need something from Jstor, I'll do what I can to get it for you.

[[Instrume]] 
2:39 AM

It's great, everything that you can think, has been thought of before.

[[h0p3]] 
2:40 AM

That may be true.

Henry Sidgwick also may be valuable to your investigation about this tension.

I appreciate your taking the time to fulfill my request. Thank you.

2:44 AM

You're welcome, and I won't take more of your time. :)

Prima facie, yes.

I admire aspects of Taoism.

[[Instrume]] 
2:58 AM

Um, to address your previous points, fairness and justice are highly arbitrary and subjective. Efficiency is also subjective, insofar as it's also a valuation, but less so than fairness and justice, since efficiency is closer to the empirical world.

About Chinese vs Chinese government, Chinese are a diverse group, with loyalists, opportunists, idealists of different stripes, etc.

Their accountability for state disaster is closer to Little Eichmann claims in the United States regarding what happened on 9/11.

In fact, their accountability could be claimed to be less, since Americans at least vote and the social structure at least claims to rely on popular sovereignty.

But there are many loyalists, and it seems sociologically most societies are conservative at any given point in time.

MAGA shouldn't have been a surprise, even if they were likely way to the right of the mainstream.

Regarding fairless, likewise, there's a more trenchant argument about the implicit guilt of Americans, who live in a world system centric upon them (they claim to have primacy), in the wrongs of the world as well.

It seems as though they prefer a deontological ethics; because while the world system has issues, their hands are directly clean; they took no direct action creating global issues, which, in my view, are more centered on poverty, underdevelopment, and ignorance.

It's pretty annoying to know that only around 1/7th of the world can be considered First World, which would be enough to put all people living in the First World into a type of aristocracy.

And this injustice can also be construed in terms of efficiency; i.e, the widespread poverty and ignorance also results in massive wastes of human capital, unless you subscribe to racist notions that people living the Global South are biologically inferior and making them just as privileged as others would not improve global output

[[h0p3]] 
3:10 AM

That is a fascinating perspective. Thank you.

I'm a person who enjoys thinking about efficiency, though I never understand enough.

It's one of the joys of being autistic, imho: I enjoy thinking about systems, especially efficiency. I have an addictive personality for vidja games and even some tabletop kinds.

How would you try to make the world more efficient? Any crazy or mundane ideas. I'm definitely looking for answers (and I know, this is a stupid hard problem: I'm interested in your unguarded speculation too).

[[Instrume]] 
3:15 AM

Just give effective altruism charities some money to start with

get people to discuss that the world is unfair and unjust, but that if it were less unfair and unjust, it'd be more efficient, and better off for everyone

evil and stupid and often interlocking categories

''''*are often

[[h0p3]] 
3:17 AM

I agree. I'm often thinking about the relationship between malice and ignorance. It's a hard problem.

I must admit, I am not much of a fan of the effective altruism sphere. #notall, I know. And, I do have hopes for them.

But, I agree that wise generosity is absolutely crucial, as are conversations like ours.

I'm glad to know you pursue efficiency there.

If you ever meet a Kenyan who might want to make such a video game, please send them my way. I aim to equip everyone I know as best I can.

I speak with all kinds. It is my honor.
