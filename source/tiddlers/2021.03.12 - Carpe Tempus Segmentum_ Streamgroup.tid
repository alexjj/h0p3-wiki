//Sadly, I can't remember well enough.//

[[TTTOTW]]. Reese's Pieces. =). Up late this time. Glad I sat and thought. It's muh job.

Played matches with everyone. My daughter's deck is strong. She took a game off me, and almost another one. I'm wondering if my son' intuitions are going to catch up. They usually do. His mastery with MUC should translate here. Generalizing is hard for an autist though. Good practice. I should have stepped in to help my bro more. Next draft, I will play hands open the entire time. I want them to see what I'm doing. That's usually the best way to teach. 

Inform the Men! Everyone is sore. It was a good day. Shower of the gods!

[[Family Gathering]], my brother made this insane "throw together" stirfry dish that was impeccable. I'm jelly that he can just throw something together like that. It's absurd. We stuffed ourselves and talked. My food sucks in comparison. Everyone is sad when dad cooks now, lol. Understandably. 

Joined my ᛝLightᛝ's streamgroup. The lowest trust link is at the heart of my threat model. They were very gracious, hosting a retard with them for the evening. My art would be boring to watch by comparison. =).<<ref "t">>
