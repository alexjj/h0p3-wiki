title: 2020.07.15 - Prompted Introspection: Chris

!! Tell about a friend you have with a different national background.

My wife has heard from [[2019.07.17 - Prompted Introspection: Jop]] recently. [[Jop]] seems bored, tired of being stuck in the house, and worried. The quarantine seems especially hard for her.

[[Friendship]] is a problematic concept. I'm going to stretch it here for a person that I got along with well enough, but we had our difficulties. It's been over a decade since I spoke with him. His name is Chris. He was a bold, annoying, and intelligent Scottish man, 5' tall, a scuba trainer, and he taught English in Thailand. I've never met a man who produced children with so many different mothers. I'm sure he has a dozen different wives (and little wives, as they say). He was a cheerful man that expected little of others. Most of the ex-pats did not care for him.
