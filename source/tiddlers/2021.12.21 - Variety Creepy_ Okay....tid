Okay…

Hello there! How've you been? How's college? How's ace-[[dating|https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/pj52i3/i_think_i_actually_deserve_to_have_high/]] going ([[masturbation]] benefits from [[significant practice|https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/q4qjua/why_are_there_condoms_in_different_flavours/hg35gqw/]], btw, and perhaps [[hitting puberty late|https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/pmjkvv/how_do_you_all_get_used_to_the_stench_of_semen/hcidwk8/]] may affect you non-trivially here too)? It's not clear to me that [[you really know|https://www.reddit.com/r/asexualdating/comments/rdbuy2/this_world_is_full_of_conspiracies/]] what you're looking for or why, in the end. How's that [[kink|https://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/or6wly/is_it_possible_to_have_kinks_as_an_asexual/]]? I know [[that feel|https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/r3i1xb/how_do_i_grow_a_pair_and_call_it_quits_to_a/]], bro (and, I think you're wise to doubt anyone who uses the self-centered excuse "[[I suck at keeping in touch with people|https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/r3i1xb/how_do_i_grow_a_pair_and_call_it_quits_to_a/hmap265/]]"). It also sounds like you've been coming to terms with some [[difficult issues|https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ouncxu/aita_for_paying_for_one_daughters_extras_but_not/h78204x/]] (still wrestling with the privileges, appearances of respect, and security of having your [[power]]ful dad, trying to be your own man while your family appears to disintegrate [or the gaps only become more obvious], and I think the decisions you make concerning your own responsibilities in general will last a lifetime, sir), and I'm glad you're still alive (I know you continue to think about it a lot, but I'm growing confident that you're gonna make it, sir). I'm hoping you'll be able to make sense of the [[dualities|https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/qfhopr/the_moment_i_leave_college_i_turn_off_its_like_an/]] and [[polarities|https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/qtq9iu/my_cycles_are_weird_does_anyone_have_it_like_this/]] in your life. I know it's sometimes so very expensive to engage in existential labor (lawd, do I). Your normative conclusion/justification [[here|https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/pkwtdi/rap_is_musically_better_than_it_has_ever_been/hc6vzbg/]] is horrific. I've discussed [[this|https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ple04h/who_or_what_ruined_you/hca307w/]] with you (I'm not convinced you're going to like the truth), and I think it's fair to say you have even more crucial decisions about your [[faith]] to make here (what does it mean to not become like your father [[irwartfrr]]? [I know this pain, no doubt]). I clearly attract people who have given up their religions (I ask you to consider my {[[Axiom]]}, [[Deconstruction Obligates Reconstruction]]), but I'm an expensive person to [[wrestle]] with here (everyone has a religion, and I can see what you're dealing with). There are many [[4chan apps|https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/p0yq9u/does_4chan_have_an_app_or_is_it_only_accessible/]].  You've switched accounts again (it's a pleasure to read through your account), my friend. Why's that? I'm glad [[to see|https://i.redd.it/52wbas7dso481.jpg]] you [[change]] your mind, to some [[dok]], about the value of [[privacy]]. Yes, I'd like proof from https://skandablogs.medium.com/. I do [[aim]] to be timely in [[my responses|https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/pj66yr/i_dont_think_its_wrong_to_expect_people_to_reply/]], but being that I'm in [[Reply Mode]], it will be from my ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 or other means on the [[Contact]] list. Session is officially down for me. Tox remains. Briar lives. I've got [[DarkMX]] up as well, if you'd like to join me there, and I'm happy to speak from site to site. I'm excited to see who you're going to be, sir.

I have been good, I guess. College is alright. It has been a mess currently
The ace dating has been going with not much success. It’s like tinder but on Reddit. Less possibility of success, more chatting.
Yep, I have finally let go of that girl
I’ve kind of come to terms with all of my family stuff now. I’m focusing more on mysef
Myself*
You’re probably right about the rap music comment. It’s stupid.
Yeah, we have discussed that and I would like to learn about the truth. Whether I like it or not.
When I say, “I don’t want to be like my father”, I mean that I don’t want to end up making mistakes like him. I would teach my children on what to do. I mostly learnt what not to do based on my dad’s actions.
I am no longer switching accounts anymore. I have created 2 proper ones and I won’t be deleting them. That’s it.

Though my memory is faulty (I am [[fff]]), I have not forgotten you, sir. Even my own family knows who you are (I speak about you with others). Searching for your name in my ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 will demonstrate that I have continued to think about you (and there are places that don't name you that have been inspired, in part, by you). Do you remember me? `/this` is my account.

I am really flattered by this. Yes, I have thought a lot about you too. I had something to discuss with you that day, so I tried to contact you. Sorry for not texting you on session. I had exams at that time and I needed to focus on them. I’m done with all exams and I’ve got college now.

That's pretty close! As we both know, you have a fairly good memory, my friend (my family has heard me rave about your knowledge and intelligence many times as well). All of these can be easily known from the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 (including just reading from the [[Variety Creepy]] page alone). That's why it doesn't count much as evidence (I agree it's not nothing), let alone proof, that you are who you say you are or that you know me all that well (which is fine*). But, I will agree that your words make me more confident that you are who you say you are; I believe [[Variety Creepy]] is one who would say your words. I [[hope]] you remember that this is where I intend to write from.
<<<

I never expected you to have a literal page for me! No one has done so much for me. Thank you very very much!

Yes, sir. I have been. I've been reading through your Reddit account too (which is not something I do for almost anyone else [sits in a tab on my left, a precious space I save]). I know what it's like to still be searching for [[intimacy]]. I can't say either of us are well-suited to the world as it is (which isn't our fault*). I've thought about pointing you here well over a dozen times. I keep getting burned (and, I say that knowing that my comfort zone is not necessarily a good benchmark). This is the way I'm going to do it.
<<<

Haha! I guess I finally figured it out!
