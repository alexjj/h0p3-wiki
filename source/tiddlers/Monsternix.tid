//Monsternix, Ph30Nix, Divinix, h0p3nix, 0nix, [[NixOS]]...[[IDK]]. architecture astronautery delusions//

I do declare: I want Nix as a base. It's a step forward toward Ansible + Linux From Scratch with much better dependency control. Reproduction makes sense. It seems too useful for all the projects, and I don't see the documentation, language, or ecosystem getting much easier to use anytime soon.

*#* check for existing nodes with k, if it exists, then make k+1, and so on
*#* Do we need to maintain two connections for the time shift? 
*#** We could have some run permanently (manually entered, static), but those keys cannot be put into the script since they are secrets (and those can only be had if we are already bootstrapped).
*#* Should probalby include verification and blacklisting

* Containers
** Snap container, Deb Container, etc. container. I'd like to duplicate aspects of [[JuNest]]. Could, of course, use one of the distributions designed for it running them all. Hrm.
