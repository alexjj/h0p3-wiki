"""
Iâ€™m halfway done with the semester at this point. Feels good. But also, eight more week of hell haha
Feb 23 12:59pm
how are you?
Feb 23 12:59pm
Yo =)
Feb 23 4:10pm
I am glad to hear it's halfway over, sir.
Feb 23 4:10pm
8 weeks can be done! You have any concerns?
Feb 23 4:10pm
I'm hanging in there. Do the same thing, roughly. Uncurling some, I'd say.
Feb 23 4:18pm
Hoping to hear back from [[OldestCrone]].
Feb 23 4:20pm
The magnitude of work thatâ€™s till needs to be done mostly haha. I saw your correspondence! They seem like someone really set in their ways...
Feb 23 6:50pm
That still**
Feb 23 6:50pm
Iâ€™ll be sending my stuff your way once itâ€™s created. :)
Feb 23 6:50pm
Good.
Feb 23 6:50pm
How is working going, btw?
Feb 23 6:51pm
(Yeah, they are old, probably set in their ways, we'll see what they say, if anything)
Feb 23 6:51pm
I went in today and didnâ€™t really have anything to do, so I just kinda hung out. Thursday I should have plenty more to do. Snowpocalypse and administrative things are hindering my workflow right now.
Feb 23 6:51pm
More time for homework though so we love that.
Feb 23 6:51pm
Library aint a terrible place to study, thankfully
Feb 23 6:53pm
Global warming making the weather crazy everywhere.
Feb 23 6:53pm
Very pretty dangerous powder.
Feb 23 6:54pm
I thought your argument was pretty neutral. I hope you get a response.
Feb 23 7:00pm
And yes. I love the library. Itâ€™s a great place to relax and focus. Being able to stay away from the other students is a great perk too.
Feb 23 7:00pm
Please tell me that you shush the kids.
Feb 23 7:01pm

ðŸ˜‚
I have strongly considered it, but I just donâ€™t care enough lmao.
Feb 23 7:01pm
lol
Feb 23 7:01pm
I do wish I had the courage to tell them to put their masks on though. Itâ€™s a huge problem and nobody is dealing with it.
Feb 23 7:04pm
I am surprised by that
Feb 23 7:04pm
It just feels so unsafe.
Feb 23 7:04pm
SAME
Feb 23 7:04pm
You have any idea when you'll be able to get vaccinated?
Feb 23 7:05pm
This is my generation: the activists. College students tend to be more progressive than others. Why are masks suddenly an issue?
Feb 23 7:05pm
Not yet. I can through school but I havenâ€™t looked it into yet.
Feb 23 7:05pm
i want to be sure [[L]] can get vaccinated too.
Feb 23 7:06pm
Rolling out really slowly here
Feb 23 7:06pm
Maybe they are desensitized to it. I know lots of people who work dangerous jobs that eventually stop thinking about it entirely (would go crazy otherwise).
Feb 23 7:07pm
Yeah. I just wanna wait it out. Weâ€™ll hit the next phase soon enough then we can get it taken care of. I also donâ€™t want to prod too early in case someone else needs it more.
Feb 23 7:07pm
Could be.
Feb 23 7:07pm
Hopefully the 4th wave will be the last.
Feb 23 7:07pm
Hereâ€™s hoping. Ready for this whole mess to be over. Not that I mind being a homebody, but it would be nice to not feel like weâ€™re brushing with death when we go out.
Feb 23 7:08pm
That's how you know this shit has gone too far. Even the hikis have a nostalgia for going outside when it was safe.
Feb 23 7:09pm

ðŸ˜‚
Your family doing alright?
Feb 23 7:10pm
I just wanna go sit in a restaurant and relax haha. 

They all seem okay!  Would like to see them more this year but they donâ€™t social distance and take masks super seriously so itâ€™s hard.
Feb 23 7:11pm
[[k0sh3k]] and the kids good? :)
Feb 23 7:11pm
Yeah, that's gotta be tough. I'm glad they are doing okay though.
Feb 23 7:13pm
[[k0sh3k]] is swamped with bullshit at work, but it alright I think.
Feb 23 7:14pm
I'm hoping things slow down here in a couple months after her stupid management classes (absurd timesinks).
Feb 23 7:14pm
My offspring are not working as hard as I wish, but I'm at the point where it's not up to me.
Feb 23 7:15pm
Focusing on whatever time I do get to have with them, making it enjoyable. Trying to become a solid rommate for em.
Feb 23 7:16pm
rommate, hehe. Sounds likes like an emulator tool.
Feb 23 7:16pm
Mother fuck, I will english tonight.
Feb 23 7:16pm
I need sleep.
Feb 23 7:16pm
Reading Sphygmus' diaries from back in college. She wrote 750 words minimum a day back then. Been waiting for a long time to read them. A treat, and makes more sense of the world for me.
Feb 23 7:18pm
How's [[L]] doing?
Feb 23 7:18pm
Yeah I sympathize with her struggles. Nobody likes sitting in pointless meetings all day. Itâ€™s a great waste of time. 

I hear that too. If they want to do well, theyâ€™re going to have to fight for it themselves. 

English is hard. XD

Hope Sphygmus is doing well! I bet those are wonderful indeed. :) hoping your conversations together are going well. 

Sheâ€™s struggling today but seems to be doing well overall. Friendship time is good for her mental health. 

Sorry for the delay in response btw. Class ends at 7:30 and Prog starts at 7:30. Tuesdays suck. :/
