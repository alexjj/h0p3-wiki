title: 2020.05.18 - Prompted Introspection: All About Me

!! What's one of the most difficult parts about being you?

[[2018.11.12 - Prompted Introspection: 99 Problems]]...Preach, yo! Lol. I can't top that. Two years later, and a handful of sentences still nails it. It's not impossible for my answer to change, but I don't see it happening. I'm changing the [[prompt]] for the usual superlative reason. There's no reason to waste this vanilla question.

Overall, I think my life is considerably easier than most others. While I do fight for my survival in many respects, I've had way more resources and opportunities than most will ever have to survive and to thrive. I've won a lot of lotteries. Finding the correct way to spend my privilege isn't easy.<<ref "w">> It's difficult to not be selfish, [[WINTCIS]]. Spending my life on something [[other]] than myself is expensive. It always has been.
