[14:47:22] h0p3: How goes it, sir?
[14:47:47] b3nsn0w: hi
[14:47:55] b3nsn0w: it's kinda weird
[14:48:14] h0p3: Ah, what's weird?
[14:48:22] h0p3: World is totally normal, haha =)
[14:48:27] b3nsn0w: I'm supposed to code, but just can't get myself to it
[14:48:33] b3nsn0w: yeah, sure, as normal as ever
[14:48:51] b3nsn0w: it's a weird place usually
[14:48:55] b3nsn0w: anyway, sorry, go on
[14:49:44] b3nsn0w: dammit... okay, my brain is in a completely different place right now, sorry if I'm being inconsistent here
[14:50:06] b3nsn0w: I'm procrastinating by doing some detective work on a story
[14:50:11] b3nsn0w: ever played Life Is Strange?
[14:50:26] h0p3: Never heard of it
[14:50:39] h0p3: Wait
[14:50:45] b3nsn0w: it's an incredible game
[14:50:52] b3nsn0w: story-based, that's its main appeal
[14:50:54] h0p3: Yeah, this looks interesting.
[14:51:27] b3nsn0w: has the best hard magic time travel mechanic I've ever seen, anywhere
[14:51:39] b3nsn0w: (granted, I still have a lot to catch up with, but it's seriously great)
[14:51:44] b3nsn0w: the characters are just flat out incredible
[14:52:13] b3nsn0w: and the story... in 13 years it's the first one where I actually had to take a short break at the climax because it got so intense
[14:52:41] h0p3: The best kind of story. 
[14:52:51] b3nsn0w: yep
[14:53:03] b3nsn0w: I'm kinda hunting for these kind of games nowadays
[14:53:12] h0p3: You do any RPing?
[14:53:28] b3nsn0w: like tabletop, larp, and the likes?
[14:53:54] h0p3: Aye. Seem to be lots of different kinds. 
[14:54:16] b3nsn0w: yeah, never got to do it, but its on my bucket list
[14:54:21] b3nsn0w: aside from the singleplayer version
[14:54:31] b3nsn0w: but I've been informed that's called "writing a book"
[14:56:06] h0p3: =)
[14:56:09] h0p3: How goes the book writing?
[14:56:46] b3nsn0w: haven't focused on it for months at this point
[14:56:48] b3nsn0w: I should get back to it
[14:57:06] h0p3: It's a beast getting myself to focus.
[14:57:11] h0p3: Too many fucking things to do.
[14:57:25] b3nsn0w: yeah, I hear you
[14:57:29] b3nsn0w: it's the same here
[14:57:56] b3nsn0w: a little over a year ago I started a "laziness tracker" calendar
[14:58:17] b3nsn0w: it's basically a whiteboard where I draw an icon for every day depending on what productive thing I did
[14:58:27] b3nsn0w: or a little black dot if I haven't done anything productive that day
[14:58:47] h0p3: Nice visual
[14:58:52] b3nsn0w: lately, I switched over to two lines (or flat icons) instead of one per day
[14:58:57] b3nsn0w: split my days into two time slots
[14:59:06] h0p3: Aye. Sounds like a good idea to me.
[14:59:19] b3nsn0w: one from 4-8 PM (can extend to 9), and one from 11 PM to 3 AM (can extend to 4)
[14:59:28] b3nsn0w: and now I'm tracking both slots individually
[14:59:55] b3nsn0w: this change helped a ton, because now I'm asking myself to be productive twice a day instead of once
[15:00:00] b3nsn0w: so yeah, can definitely recommend
[15:02:20] h0p3: I'm hoping here in a few years, I will have more time to focus on my own projects. Currently, I'm primarily a dad, philosopher second. Just trying to get my offspring to push. Trying to stay sane, lol.
[15:03:48] h0p3: We do that tick tock 2-push day with them. My wife's work is more standardized in the morning. I handle the pragmatics and then we go wherever I think we must in the evening. 
[15:04:40] b3nsn0w: well, good luck with it
[15:04:54] h0p3: gracias, we'll need it
[15:05:33] h0p3: Been prepping some more lately. Started a garden (though I have no idea if anything will grow). 
[15:06:17] b3nsn0w: that sounds nice
[15:06:40] b3nsn0w: we had a garden way back a decade or so ago
[15:07:12] b3nsn0w: I think it's still there, although I have no idea how it is
[15:07:37] b3nsn0w: it's kind of at the back where you never really have a reason to go
[15:07:52] b3nsn0w: but it definitely sounds like a fun hobby
[15:08:21] h0p3: It's probably a useful experience, but we didn't start it as a hobby.
[15:09:15] h0p3: We've already had food supply chain disruptions. I am preparing for the possibility it will get worse, though it probably won't.
[15:09:40] b3nsn0w: oh
[15:10:03] b3nsn0w: yeah, I really hope for that to not happen
[15:10:09] h0p3: Ha, yeah, me too. 
[15:11:50] h0p3: The conservative estimates are that 1 in 6 children in the US are experiencing hunger, and that's only the parents willing to admit it. Long lines at foodbanks. The division between the proletariat and the capitalists continue to grow here. 
[15:12:36] h0p3: (our school systems are used to ensure that children are fed; growing up, I knew plenty of kids that only got to eat at school)
[15:14:01] b3nsn0w: that's fucked up
[15:14:08] h0p3: Welcome to America!
[15:14:18] b3nsn0w: especially when you add the stories of lunch debt to it
[15:14:25] h0p3: Disgusting
[15:14:30] b3nsn0w: Greatest Country in the World™
[15:14:34] b3nsn0w: *for anyone who can afford it
[15:15:07] b3nsn0w: seriously, it's crazy
[15:18:06] h0p3: Electric anxiety for me reading. I realize I'm in a far safer position than most people too. 
[15:18:47] h0p3: How do things look on your section of the planet?
[15:19:09] b3nsn0w: we got hit much lighter, luckily
[15:19:40] b3nsn0w: after Italy's example all European basically started the lockdown immediately
[15:19:45] h0p3: Aye
[15:20:20] h0p3: Do you have reasonable safety nets for the poor? How are they handling quarantine?
[15:20:46] b3nsn0w: doubt it, but I'm not really up to date on that
[15:21:04] b3nsn0w: I don't read any news I can avoid, and the unavoiadble ones seem to be US politics jammed into meme sites
[15:21:42] b3nsn0w: poverty is very much a thing here, we're kinda halfway between the US and India
[15:21:52] b3nsn0w: geometric mean, I think
[15:22:00] b3nsn0w: or something close to that
[15:23:00] b3nsn0w: but I haven't heard of any supply chain disruptions or the likes, and we haven't had people protesting against the lockdown either
[15:23:27] b3nsn0w: there have been some who just didn't give a shit and acted stupid
[15:23:36] b3nsn0w: but mostly they do it individually
[15:24:11] b3nsn0w: also, they're trying to open up the country gradually, but I'm still pretty sure that's only gonna result in a second wave
[15:24:38] h0p3: Agreed.
[15:24:51] b3nsn0w: at least it's not a polarized political issue here, all sides just try to make the claim that the other one is irresponsible against the virus
[15:25:05] b3nsn0w: so at least we can avoid that catalyst of idiocy
[15:27:00] h0p3: Polarization is necessary. I consider it a fundamental philosophical concept at the root of everything. I am glad that yall may be solving the problem without wasting too many resources though.
[15:27:37] b3nsn0w: maybe it is, but when it becomes identity politics it's extremely limiting and gets in the way of sane solutions
[15:27:54] b3nsn0w: granted, identity politics does that on its own anyway
[15:30:56] h0p3: Standard conceptions of identity politics boil down neoliberal virtue-signaling and the capitalist's red herring. (MORE👏🏿TRANS👏🏿POC👏🏿PRIVATE👏🏿PRISON👏🏿GUARDS👏🏿, where those are claps). Although, more generally, I still think the proles have many identities. There is no politics without dialectics between identities.
