title: 2020.09.11 - Prompted Introspection: Three Realistic Goals

!! Write about three realistic goals you would like to achieve in your lifetime.

# Finishing this [[prompt]]. 
#* Seems like quite an achievement.<<ref "s">> 
# I want to live to at least 48 for my son.
#* I'd like to help him find lifemates, SOs, people who click with him. Probably isn't going to be easy to make a living and what not. I assume the launch never really feels over (look at me: a pile of rubble).
# I'd like to take this wiki as far as I can.
