title: 2021.04.12 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Hell Yeah

Like speaking to a long-lost friend, I had a fascinating conversation with [[Instrume]] (gorgeous name to boot).<<ref "i">> The person is quite knowledgeable and clever. I'm glad we had the chance to speak. I hope they'll consider speaking more and more carefully with me. I'd be interested to see them put their skin in the game here too. 

Kitty Krack Time! Vapelyfe to join my ninja. `/cheers`. Sometimes Ranga is too respectful of my space. It's ingrained in him. He's not been punished for being on my desk (well, except hugs, maybe he just doesn't want my hugs? [nooooooo!!! LOVE ME!] That sucks, if true - he doesn't care for hugs from anyone though generally, but he likes belly rubs). Wish he enjoyed it more. I suppose I could put the crack up on my desk. I have just enough space on the left side to hold our cardboard scratchpad thing. If I'm going to [[TTTOTW]], I need to do it in style, like Dr. Claw (mofo's OG).

[[TTTOTW]]. Had a pizza. Made sure my son was up (he's sleeping in too late). Wife sent me to bed; she was in a good mood. Her sleep last night hit hard. I slept thoroughly.

Intrusion Alarm, Red ALERT! The monsters are here. Battlestation(s), Battlestation(s)! Exactly how I want to wake up. Delicious. I did eventually get my underwear on because my chair is still new enough that I don't wish to ruin it with my sticky ballsack (and, I've found that as I get older, it only stays sticky; it can never become unsticky once it got stuck). 

Hugs'n'bugs. Bro was proud, offspring weren't. Assignments for the wee ones. Talked about my encounter with [[Instrume]] with [[Scout]]. 

//Skintime//, thinking about her seminar (I'm thinking she should just spend more time with the students than anyone else). Inform the Men! Meditation. Shower of the gods! [[TTTOTW]].

[[Family Gathering]] was fulfilling. Offspring made dinner for us. Asha noodles, sprouts, and wantons (plus coffee). My daughter asked for us to be nice, so we're all doing it (her included); turns out, we're getting better at it. My daughter played two games with me. The last one, she gave up too early, so I had her switch places to see. Always talking about life when we play ~~baseball~~ [[magic]].
