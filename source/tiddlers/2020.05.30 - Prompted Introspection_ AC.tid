!! What is a convenience you wouldn't want to do without?

[[2019.01.24 - Prompted Introspection: Maximum Convenience]] will hopefully stave off the caveat-itch for a while. Yeah, the concept requires more analysis than I've given, but I'm going with the flow for now (lord help me). 

Air Conditioning is a convenience that I wouldn't want to do without. I've lived in some fairly hot locations. Thailand and New Orleans were both miserable without air conditioning. I've noticed the climb in temperatures in my lifetime as well, and I'm convinced this is a convenience I will continue to treasure. Being too hot is bad for my emotional state, limits my ability to reason and learn, and I have better outcomes with cooler temperatures. Of course, I can only take so much off.
