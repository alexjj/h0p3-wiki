title: 2020.12.29 - Prompted Introspection: Receiving

!! In total, have you given or received more oral sex?

Just in terms of quantity, it's pretty close. To completion, it is not. More generally, I would bet on receiving. It would be strongly in her favor if it were up to me. Admittedly, our sex is far more for me than for her. It's a gift she generously gives me, including allowing me to give.<<ref "i">> It's not that my wife is not a sexual creature at all, she simply doesn't have the [[dok]] of desires that some do. She's somewhat ace. She can survive, her personality intact and life similarly fulfilled, without being sexually active often; it's not a need for her, it's an elective that doesn't necessarily draw her {[[Focus]]}. I don't think she'd want to give up her sexuality, but it's a lower priority in her character, likely generating far less average utility in her life than many other pursuits in most contexts. She sees the world differently than me. By default, at least 80% of the time when I look at her, it's in lust, usually thinking about how I want every inch of her fucked right then;<<ref "s">> I have to turn it off and ignore it sometimes for us to function ([[WINTCIS]]).<<ref "p">> To the question: I'm the one who benefits far more. I am [[grateful]].

<<footnotes "p" "It's fair to say it is (perhaps neutrally) pathological in me. I have an addictive personality. I tend to know what I want, and I tend to want it intensely and constantly. We make an interesting pair on either end of this spectrum.">>
