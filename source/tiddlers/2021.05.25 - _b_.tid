I don't think the need for backwards compatibility is disappearing. Even Windows with its EEE tactic may be seeking higher degrees of backwards compability. Accepting a Blink browser, integrating more command line tooling, and several attempts at virtualization tell a different story to me, one concerned with drawing developers away from Apple. Hardware compability might be a different story though.

Don't fetishize me in any way that I would not consent to. I won't give you a justification for why you ought not besides vaguely pointing to my own fetishes (including finding a way to be further a victim rather than pay attention to those clearly more victimized than myself). I'd rather you want or need me without requiring any recriprocation, commitment, or costs. You are responsible for your signaling, but not me for mine. No, really: life is just about pursuing my desires.

Robust self-identification is at least an uncovering of our embedded relationships to Forms and other minds. I agree that we can be imprisoned by the desire to be perceived as free, as is the case for any mere status signaling. Unchecked mimesis, non-moral autonomy pursuits of originality or authenticity, and failures to distinguish accomplishment from recognition appraisal are obviously dangerous in many cases.

Why should I care if a standard of [[Beauty]] is fabricated? As long as the fabrication is moral, we're golden, right? I'll admit it: I regret that I have no step-sister to bang. =(.

If you want to kill a capitalist or exploitative manager, show us a place to meet you online (must be negotiable). Talk about it with everyone. We'll think about how to do it, in minecraft. God is dead, but you are permitted.

I'm pretty sure I'm doing something wrong as a parent. Neither of my children want to be sluts, and I have no idea how to convince them to go out and get laid. We shall give it time.
