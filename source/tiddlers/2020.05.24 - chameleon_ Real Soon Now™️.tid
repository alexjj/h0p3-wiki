"""
[2:30 AM] h0p3: How goes it?
[2:42 AM] chameleon: Yeah not too bad!
[2:42 AM] h0p3: Noice
[2:43 AM] chameleon: Wiki stuff a lil... sporadic
[2:43 AM] h0p3: That's how it goes sometimes.
[2:43 AM] h0p3: Like life
[2:43 AM] chameleon: Finally wrote down that breakfast burrito recipe, at least =w=.
[2:44 AM] h0p3: A true art. Imho, breakfast is the fundamental Southern meal.
[2:45 AM] h0p3: Hard to pick out a single breakfast I don't like too, lol.
[2:46 AM] h0p3: Everything in TN opening up at this point? You were able to hit the bookstore. Will the card shop open up soon too?
[2:50 AM] chameleon: Less likely. It's run by two older boomers, so I think it'll take a while for that to reopen
[2:50 AM] h0p3: Ah. k
[2:51 AM] h0p3: Soon^^tm^^, hopefully
[2:51 AM] h0p3: After the second wave hits and we sacrifice more, the acceleration might actually make it so you can.
[2:51 AM] chameleon: Yeah real soon now™️
[2:52 AM] h0p3: lol
[2:52 AM] chameleon:

[2:52 AM] chameleon: :POG:
[2:52 AM] chameleon: I need a bottle of this to get to magic time
[2:53 AM] chameleon: I really miss magic. Haven't played in an age
[2:53 AM] h0p3: I'd share the box we opened if I could. Two hefty glasses in to try to forget the day, lol.
[2:53 AM] h0p3: Drunk magic is special
[2:54 AM] h0p3: Not all shops will let you play drunk. Some do though.
[2:58 AM] chameleon: ehehe
[2:59 AM] chameleon: I know that our LGS has the rule that you can't eat outside food or drink outside drink there
[2:59 AM] chameleon: ...even thinking about the fridge is making me miss the place, fuck
