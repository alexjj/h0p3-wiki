title: 2021.06.25 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: The Museum

Offspring are playing with friends. I hope they will think about what it means to own their schedules. Meet the requirements so you can do whatever the fuck you want! 

[[TTTOTW]]+leftovers. I really like bubbles in water. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Attempted sleep by 9:45.

Garbage sleep, again...stressed, that tightness in my chest (but at least no convolutions in my gut), and a serious headache. My wife came down to let me know we were heading out soon, and I almost didn't go. I'm glad I did though.

I rode in the back with my offspring. My daughter does not like the fact that she can smell mint on our breaths.<<ref "i">> She's increasingly overwhelmed by sound too, I think. Blocks it out. Cool. Went a different way than usual into the city. 

I look cute with my man-purse. I'd rather be comfortable in my athletic shorts (strictly a fat autist thing, I swear) and not deal with the hassle of people being unhappy that they are slipping off me because my pockets are filled with heavy electronics and more authentication mechanisms. 

Gotta say, that is a fancy museum.<<ref "g">> I'm glad my daughter got to see this place.<<ref "t">> Hundreds of millions of dollars poured into it. The whole building was to-the-nines a monument to capitalism. There were security guards every 40 feet, and they were extremely active too. I got to see a bust of [[Saint Plato]] and shed a tear (normally this sort of thing doesn't move me, but it's my teacher). I admire the difficulty in crafting these objects (especially with their resources), but I guess these pieces end up being too small in scope for me in a way. Whoever did the lighting for some of the oil paintings did a damned good job; they glow and move, HPPD triggers abound, it's 3D. I prefer the modern/contemporary section because it allows me to slice through what consists in [[art]], why it matters, and I either laugh at it or am taken by it, with little in between. In any case, show me ass and titties in the art pieces and the gorgeous girls in the museum,<<ref "w">> and I'll be alright. =).

[[JRE]] called while I was on the 3rd floor. I walked and then laid down while listening (upset the security guard, and I gladly ignored seeing the Dali to just talk [mostly listen, as I do these days]). His own truck and schedule: he's on his own now. Troubleshooting just fine, and I think he'll become a master of it very quickly. Got to play with some badass industrial toys in huge basins (Louisville has significant flooding risks they have to handle). He's sounding more satisfied with this position than almost any I can remember, but he's missing an apprentice (that's actually a big deal, imho). He's working with more cops though, and that's difficult. Colorblindness is becoming more difficult to deal with, and perhaps a technical solution is in order at this point. Also, 2nd ER visit with a "waterfall" or one of those shaker music-maker toys that has a trickle of beads through it, but in his intestines, nasty burps, no poops. He's been receiving too much radiation from all the scans he's had over the years. Doctors don't seem particularly concerned, but I trust my brother's gut about his gut. [[Rb]] hasn't put in her notice because of the probationary period + ER (though, I think he can easily find another, and they've got plenty to float on). The boys are babbling more, and [[Bn]] is saying "no way" a bunch. [[Q]] is rejecting baby food: big boy now (well, he's always been a big boy, gonna be monster huge). Brother has to head to his brother-in-law's for a BBQ, and that man does not reason wisely about almost anything, including wood-working. Being with maliciously ignorant people is quite draining for my brother. I think it will be yet another valuable opportunity to see how he's clearly a much better father and husband. 

We went to Pitaziki's! Holy fuck, I'd trade a million Monets<<ref "m">> for a box of this shit. It's insane. It's expensive too. $9-14 for a meal, lawd. We then stopped in on an innercity park that had live music, lawn-games, and women who dressed for the gaze (and, we were all quite thankful, even [[k0sh3k]] was 'mirin). Gotta say, there's too much money concentrated here. Rubs me the wrong way. 

We had considered the second planned part of journey, a hike, but I think everyone was pooped. Too many people, and we were drained. My daughter rested her head on my shoulder to sleep on the way back. God damn, I adore my wife's vacation; she's deserve a much longer one.

//Skintime//+//The Office// until I couldn't stay awake. No idea what time I fell asleep.

Woke at 11:30. Still anxiety in my chest, headache largely faded. I needed that sleep. Fireman Time!
