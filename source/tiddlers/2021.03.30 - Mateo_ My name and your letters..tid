title: 2021.03.30 - Mateo: My name and your letters.

I didn't choose my name, it was given to me, so why should I feel identified with it? It's one more name, it could have been a million other names. It's a word for calling me, for others to know how to refer to me. I'm not saying the words have no meaning, I'm saying the name, and maybe even the Name as an idea, has no power. Because if I have a son, or daughter, and call him Esperanza, which means "hope", it doesn't mean anything more than the fact that I wanted to call that way my child. If you call Guardian your dog (and I know it's not a common name, this is just an example), maybe because it's a fierce puppy that always seems to protect you, it doesn't mean that the dog is the word you put on him.

  The languaje it's a way of seeing the world. I think that when we define something with words, or give a person a name and think it should mean something, we are putting them in a cage. The words aren't the only way of communicating things, there's music, pictures, paintings, dances. I could describe how much I have loved someone by making a poem and saying in an abstract and deeply tied to my unconscious way how it felt like, or I could compose a piano solo and use the sounds to reflect the strenght, or the pain, or the joy of that feeling, or I could make a painting, and use the colors and shapes to define what I felt. And my name isn't that kind of art. No one thought of calling me this way because it meant something for them, they called me like this because they liked it, and that's all.

  And now that I read my own thoughts, I realize they doesn't make sense. A name could mean something, it could be a form of art, because we make poems and music and paintings to express how we feel, how we love, and think, and suffer, and the name could be a reflection of all this, just like the poem is, but this is a short one. I suppose I was mistaken, I apologize for writing without thinking. I won't just delete my mistake and rewrite it because it would feel very artificial, and there's a certain beauty in correcting the mistakes we do in this way. The error remains there, and the correction just below it.

  In the end, to make things clear, my name means... Why do I feel like I'm lying if I say that it doesn't mean something to me? When someone I care about, in one way or another, says my name, I feel something in my chest, like a wave of, hm, joy and anxiety, "you do know my name!" and "do you know my name?" at the same time. If my name means something, it's because it means me, and people saying it referring to me means that they are talking or thinking about me. I suppose this is important to me because I'm alone most of the time, and I don't hear people I care about saying my name as much as I would like to. Hearing them saying it triggers that lovely feeling of nervous excitement, because they are saying my name, and that means me. But I feel nothing if someone I don't care about says it. Maybe it even bothers me.

  I think I have never revealed this feelings to someone. You are the first one to read it, even if you aren't the first one to know it, you are the first in understanding it this way. And it's important for me, because even if I barely talked with you, I felt like you could understand me, and I could understand you. Writing this to you helped me to think about it, so thank you for that.

  And now that I talked about you... I've read some things you have wrote, and felt some dissapointing. Things like "We could talk about LoL if you'd like (you are obviously intelligent enough to play these games)", as if playing the most played videogame in the world and be bombarded with sexism, consumerism and have your reward system filled with short-term excitement was an achievement; or reading your words on some philosophical topic, with lots of invented words that are just two other words together, and long sentences with forced strange words to sound wise, when at the end it's all bad explained and means nothing. It all makes me fear you are like everyone else.

  I don't feel many problems with your syle of writing. You letters are fine, and I feel as if you were discovering yourself in the course of the lines, or exposing yourself, as I am who discovers you by reading you. You said that it may sound you are interviewing yourself when you write, and thats a very beutiful way of saying it. I like it that way, so don't apologize for it.

  You did apologize even if you didn't knew if I think it was bad or not. When do we have to apologize? When we think something is bad, even if it's not for others? ("Sorry for having stained you painting", "Don't worry, you only make it better!") When others think something is bad, even if it's good for us? ("I fixed your painting for you", "But I didn't want it to be fixed!")

  The moment I saw your response, I came to write you. Maybe it's because the time you spend writing for me, and I'm sensitive about that because of how alone I am most of the time. I liked the character art you made, it was a very lovely detail. I'm afraid of getting to know you better, because I'm afraid of feeling the same loneliness that fills me when talking with everyone else. It's not your letter skills that worries me.
