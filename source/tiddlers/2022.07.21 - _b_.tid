Who actually believes the American financial system has little or no exposure to the possible contagion of debt collapse cascades in China via derivatives (credit default swaps), supply chains, transnational ownership of real estate and capital, and whatever other sino-dependence permeates The Stack of Global Society? Not only is it far from obvious that Chinese loss is necessarily anyone's gain here (and, if anyone does, it's the hyperwealthy), I'm hard-pressed to pick out how American money isn't just as (if not more) corrupt, dark, centralized, overleveraged, built on militaristic exploitation, and dangerously short-sighted.

Please stop harrassing the minorities in the store; they've done nothing to you, so mind your own business. Neither you nor your fake Gucci bag will be receiving special treatment.

So, this coupon or warranty, whichever, I don't really care, expired yesterday, and it's not for our store either. Oh? Go ahead and call corporate; your privileged opinions are irrelevant. Here's their number. Please spell my name correctly when you complain. You don't seem to have the patience or intelligence to get through the automated phone system alone, so we can call them together if you'd like. Btw, did you actually pay for that haircut, Karen? My dog has the same one. C U Next Tuesday."
