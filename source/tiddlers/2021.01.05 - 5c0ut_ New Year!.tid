He might be a god
Jan 4 2:30am
You hanging in there?
Jan 4 2:31am
Yeah.  Hung out with Mikayla  Saturday Was a great time. Not much to do right now so we went for a walk down town (it's empty as fuck dude) but Bearno's pizza  was open so we had some really  good pizza, and then  we walked the highlands. I love the conversations  she and I get to have. (I also love that I don't freak out in my head about what to talk about or if I'm being awkward  it doesn't  happen with her the conversation  is very open and smooth. I think because  she is a very intelligent  person with critical  thinking  skill she's  able to make the leaps and jump in what we're talking about  when most can't keep up or even know what we're talking about). After that we came back to my pace and we + gage and his friend smoked up did some dabs and played  cards against  humanity.  I haven't  had a good laugh in a long time.  I got a headache  from laughing  to much (more like the lack of oxygen  intake haha).
Jan 4 2:46am
That is outstanding!
Jan 4 2:50am
I'm glad to hear you had an amazing day.
Jan 4 2:51am
Keeps the fire going.
Jan 4 2:51am
In a sense, I am glad to hear it is empty (people actually trying to be sane).
Jan 4 2:52am
I agree. But the amount of business  that have been lost there is crazy. Im not talk about the economic or capitalistic  part i just mean the emptiness, like these huge buildings and you look inside and nothing  some might have chairs all on the window but empty.
Jan 4 2:55am
Yes. I fear the worst has yet to come on that front too.
Jan 4 2:56am
It's gotta be tough to see it crumble/vanish.
Jan 4 2:57am
Me personally? Or those business?

Yo yo!
Jan 5 12:31am
So I fucked up. Lol
Jan 5 12:35am
How's that?
Jan 5 12:37am
I posted on Facebook forgetting  the connection  [[MWF]] and [[SLT]] have with  Gabeheart and her daughters.
Jan 5 12:40am
Amanda "reached out"
Jan 5 12:40am
Any whoo.
Jan 5 12:41am
`/sigh`. I'm sorry.
Jan 5 12:41am
It's my own fault.
Jan 5 12:43am
It could only ever be partially your fault.
Jan 5 12:43am
That network sucks.
Jan 5 12:43am
I know.  And yes it does.
Jan 5 12:51am
What did Amanda say?
Jan 5 12:51am
Image attached to message
Jan 5 12:53am
Nope. Lol
Jan 5 12:54am
I'm dying over here.
Jan 5 12:54am
I'm sorry.
Jan 5 12:54am
Right lol
Jan 5 12:54am
Triangles gonna triangulate.
Jan 5 12:54am
Get even see there's like a 2 to 3 hour delay in my response I just didn't know how to process this
Jan 5 12:54am
I have considered reaching out to Ms. Terri with my wiki. Often I divvy the world up into territory, and I think that is simply lost ground, sadly.
Jan 5 12:55am
You can*  haha üî∫Ô∏èüî∫Ô∏è
Jan 5 12:56am
Would you like me to speak with Amanda?
Jan 5 12:58am
Yeah I agree. Terri tried something  similar  last year. Saying she had "gifts from [[MWF]] and [[SLT]]" that she was trying to give them to me i  politely declined
Jan 5 12:59am
Up to you. She and I haven't spoken since the last time I physically  saw her years ago. I don't know if it would make any difference.
Jan 5 1:02am
Well, I prefer not to, lol.
Jan 5 1:02am
Then don't haha
Jan 5 1:03am
How's your day going otherwise?
Jan 5 1:03am
Ok i guess.  Im ready for this to all be done.
Jan 5 1:06am
Me too.
Jan 5 1:12am
Ugh I walked into a conversation  with gages friend that is staying with us. Ruined my high.  And just pissed me off.

Jan 5 12:32pm
So kroger just called me saying they have a management position open for 13 hour.  I get paid $11 an hour right now at Thornton's Should I take the job until I move?
Jan 5 2:59pm
Sorry it ruined your high, my dude. =/
Jan 5 4:29pm
I have no idea, sir. Your call.
Jan 5 4:29pm
I am going to take it. 2$ extra...
Jan 5 11:26pm
Makes sense to me.
Jan 5 11:26pm
Get paid, son!
Jan 5 11:26pm
lol
Jan 5 11:26pm
Will see if it actually means anything because The safeguard that we had for evictions is now gone and you will find out tomorrow morning if we get a letter
Jan 5 11:27pm
We will* find
Jan 5 11:28pm
Yes, sir. I know it's shit right now.
Jan 5 11:28pm
I am glad that you have bright things in your life still, btw. You've seemed to find happiness despite the insanity.
Jan 5 11:29pm
Me too. Lol.
