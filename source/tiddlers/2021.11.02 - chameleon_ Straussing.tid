If I'm not to trust the wiki, what am I to trust?
Your wiki is a kami, btw
Oh, I think this wiki is the place to trust.
I recognize that someone could take over my machine to masquerade as though they are me though. That's the reason for a verification. I'm relatively confident it will never be necessary. `/fingers-crossed`
How are you doing today?
I didn't hear much more about the end of the trip? Did it pan out alright?
Nothing got written because it was mostly boring. I'm safe home now and my foot wound scabbed over at last
Glad it healed
The trip was fun in the end, I was glad to have gone, and look forward to going again another time, though this time with the hubby because loneliness haha
Yeah. I bet it will be dope with him there.
Is it this kind of thing where you can show up for a couple hours and then head out with him to see the city?
Will in always be in NY you think?
It depends on how late the stay goes
at the office, that is
day rather than stay, methinks
And I think it'll be in NYC for the forseeable future, at least unless HQ moves to another city (most likely it'd move to the bay, but I don't think that's particularly likely)
Well, I hope it stays in NYC! =)
yeah me too! I don't know that I'd like the bay, haha
If you do go there, I suggest visiting Alcatraz. If you are in for bad movies, //The Rock// would be a fitting thing to watch before going.
hehehe
I do love me some bad movies
btw there's a theory that Sean Connery's character is actually a retired Bond
That makes good sense to me.
Finally think I understand [[Straussian]], by reading about it in another context: https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/what-is-it-about-peter-thiel
It almost smells a little bit like deconstruction.
Many of Strauss' students became profound neocons, libertarians, etc. Strauss only gets a "Sir" out of me. I come from two schools that specialized in him (including one where he taught at). That is one wing of thought coming out of there, and by far the most famous because of conservative political agents.
Mmm, as implied by the Thiel connection here!
I'm a fan of Straussian interpretation of known geniuses writing under difficult political conditions. I'm not a fan of gnosticism, mere rhetoric, and unjustified deception, particularly as tools wielded to maintain the centralization of power.
You might find the style of interpretation of this feller to be far more in line with what I mean by the term: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Benardete
Classic Western religious hermeneutics and exegesis training is what I consider a foundation for the style. Though, I think many would accuse a Straussian of eisegesis.
The analytic philosophers of the departments would read something from one of the greats, find a flaw, attempt to charitably reconstruct arguments to a "reasonable" degree, and if that failed, they would set the matter aside. There's a different kind of fanatical devotion, paranoic charity, and obsession in finding real or imagined lines or levels of narrative in the academic Straussians^^tm^^ I've encountered.
Pretty common to see them re-read everything written from a particular author a hundred times, becoming experts in their own re-working, as an homage, of a previous author. Has plenty in common with lit professors I've met too.
This place is exceptionally famous for it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._John%27s_College_(Annapolis/Santa_Fe)
It makes me sick to see how it tends to be wielded, particularly around the reactionary crowd. Though, I will admit that even many academic Straussian's failed here as well.
Very high rates of Virtue Theorist's egoism. Tended toward history of philosophy more than any other branch too.
