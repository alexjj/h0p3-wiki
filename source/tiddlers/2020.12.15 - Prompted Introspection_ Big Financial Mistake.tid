title: 2020.12.15 - Prompted Introspection: Big Financial Mistake

!! What was one of your biggest financial mistakes?

Most of my largest financial mistakes are a result of even larger interpersonal mistakes.<<ref "n">> I have an enormous school debt, but I would gladly do it again if I were to be in the same position.<<ref "i">> I would wish to have not been in that position in the first place. There's some spilled milk reasoning here perhaps, but it's worth thinking about many times.

My first answer: listening to the boomers in my life. Despite my ridiculous autistic gullibility, in some respects, I learned from a very young age not to trust humans. I had such good reasons not to keep giving my trust to people, and it's been a continuous cycle of deepening disappointment. It was a mistake to trust the sociopaths in my life again (and, the scope of the term continues to broaden as I study it). I've made the mistake so many times in my life, and I was increasingly responsible for them (to the extent that a victim can be responsible for their plight: and, yes, they can to some [[dok]]).<<ref "f">> That's a string a mistakes that I think also counts as a big one. Since then, I've worked to broaden the number of sources in my life.

<<footnotes "n" "Never had debt until I got married. It is, by far, the best debt I've ever acquired. Make it $2 Billion, I don't care.">>

<<footnotes "i" "Here I am pleased by the progress of the web. It is significantly easier to find what is [[salient]] now than before (though I am hacking to talk shit about the web too!). Back when I was ending college, FB, 4chan, and Reddit were brand spankin' new (Reddit was unusable, contentless), the ability to search for topics of interest and join discussions has grown considerably, even if only in virtue of sheer quantity of participants (though it more than that).">>

<<footnotes "f" "[[FTO]] is exceptionally painful here; the more I look at my {[[Axiom]]}, the more [[ridtyawtr]] I feel about it.">>
