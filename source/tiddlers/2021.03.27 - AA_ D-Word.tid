How are you doing?
Mar 27 11:06pm
Grinding along. Lots of reading and writing. Begging my dorks to do their best. Playing magic with 'em a lot lately.
Mar 27 11:07pm
[[k0sh3k]] got her first shot today.
Mar 27 11:07pm
We have to wait.
Mar 27 11:07pm
I saw that
Mar 27 11:08pm
How about you?
Mar 27 11:08pm
I have had both of mine and so has [[UJ]]
Mar 27 11:08pm
[[AG]] has to wait
Mar 27 11:08pm
[[L]] and [[K]] are supposed to be getting theirs shortly
Mar 27 11:09pm
Hopefully over this hump soon enough.
Mar 27 11:09pm
My shoulder is slowly healing after surgery
Mar 27 11:10pm
How long will it take to be all the way to full?
Mar 27 11:10pm
I dunno â€”supposed to have an appt on 4/1 and hopefully I will know more
Mar 27 11:10pm
Does it significantly interfere with sleep?
Mar 27 11:11pm
They put 6 or more screws in it with a plate
Mar 27 11:12pm
Yeah â€”hard to get comfortable
Mar 27 11:12pm
Lots of ice and pain meds â€”trying to stay mostly off the prescription stuff except one at night
Mar 27 11:13pm
On workmans comp at least
Mar 27 11:14pm
That sounds incredibly draining. Probably adds friction to even small things.
Mar 27 11:14pm
Yeah and my left side at least so it could be worse
Mar 27 11:15pm
[[UJ]] doing well? I can imagine he's been extra busy in addition.
Mar 27 11:16pm
Yeah poor guy
Mar 27 11:17pm
The dr didnâ€™t appreciate his sense of humor though â€”said something about making me do the dishes...
Mar 27 11:17pm
lmao
Mar 27 11:17pm
[[AG]] has her moments of helpfulness and [[L]] and [[K]] came down last Sunday
Mar 27 11:18pm
[[L]] helped me wash and cut my hair...canâ€™t brush it long
Mar 27 11:19pm
How short is it now?
Mar 27 11:20pm
I got a few shirts with snaps on the shoulders like a little kid â€”easier to put on
Mar 27 11:20pm
May you have no shoelaces either.
Mar 27 11:20pm

Mar 27 11:20pm
I have joined grandpa in shoe choices, I think. Something similar.
Mar 27 11:21pm
Hey, it's you! =)
Mar 27 11:21pm
Nah all my shoes are slip on
Mar 27 11:21pm
Shoulder lengthish
Mar 27 11:21pm
It's look good.
Mar 27 11:22pm
She did a good job cuttin it.
Mar 27 11:22pm
I think so too ðŸ˜Š

Mar 27 11:23pm
Not fun...
Mar 27 11:23pm
As a little tyke, when I would fall, your dad says I managed to put my drink on a table on the way down even if it meant i would face plant....I think I was trying to save my tea when I fell
Mar 27 11:25pm
Priorities
Mar 27 11:26pm
hows the fam there? [[k0sh3k]] having any side effects at all?
Mar 27 11:26pm
Pain in her arm at the moment. Second shot may be significantly harder.
Mar 27 11:26pm
Yeah â€”[[UJ]] was upset that his second shot had no side effects...insists he was promised some
Mar 27 11:27pm
I was sore with a headache
Mar 27 11:27pm
Folks seem good enough. Time passes so fast lately.
Mar 27 11:27pm
[[5c0ut]] doing ok?
Mar 27 11:28pm
Yeah, I think so. He's chillin. Been thinking a lot.
Mar 27 11:28pm
I heard something about heart surgery for him ...was that recent?
Mar 27 11:28pm
Last year, he had some. May not have solved it all, but seems like it's done some good.
Mar 27 11:29pm
Ablation? I had one of those â€”much better now
Mar 27 11:30pm
I don't remember.
Mar 27 11:30pm
I shall have to ask him ðŸ˜Š
Mar 27 11:30pm
We can be heart buddies
Mar 27 11:31pm
Aye. That makes sense.
Mar 27 11:31pm
He's still having lots of anxiety.
Mar 27 11:32pm
A lot to adjust to.
Mar 27 11:32pm
I am hoping that I can get back to doing things soon...staying in the house is not good for my mental health
Mar 27 11:33pm
Yeah â€”has he tried taking anything?
Mar 27 11:33pm
I'm not sure. Cannabis, yes.
Mar 27 11:34pm
Does that help?
Mar 27 11:34pm
I know it works for lots of people
Mar 27 11:34pm
It keeps him sober, and sometimes does more work than that too.
Mar 27 11:34pm
Thats good
Mar 27 11:35pm
Taken correctly I feel like it has more benefits than downsides
Mar 27 11:35pm
Been trying a CBD based trim, and that is calmer. A different feel.
Mar 27 11:35pm
He's been cookin up a storm too. Trying to rearrange shelves in the basement and redo the kitchen fit for him.
Mar 27 11:36pm
Nice!
Mar 27 11:36pm
Yes, it's been dope.
Mar 27 11:37pm
He and I have similar sleep schedules: absolute chaos.
Mar 27 11:37pm
A natural wandering,lol.
Mar 27 11:38pm
We have had people bringing food since my shoulder thing â€”its been nice
Mar 27 11:38pm
I am already starting to shift to up all night and sleeping while peeps are at school
Mar 27 11:38pm
It is da way.
Mar 27 11:39pm
Yep
Mar 27 11:39pm
I am not fighting itâ€”just getting rest when I can
Mar 27 11:39pm
Do you end up typing entirely one-handed?
Mar 27 11:40pm
Yep
Mar 27 11:40pm
=(
Mar 27 11:40pm
You are fast at it.
Mar 27 11:40pm
Still teaching my kids online too â€”my sub us handling the in person ones
Mar 27 11:41pm
Too much crap for one person to do...
Mar 27 11:41pm
We must find the wizard wielding the chaos orb in the world and defeat him.
Mar 27 11:42pm
From what I have read, first two weeks are the worst so hopefully bu Thursday there will be an improvement
Mar 27 11:42pm
Yes!!!
Mar 27 11:42pm
Do you think the magicquest wands would work?
Mar 27 11:43pm
:P
Mar 27 11:43pm
Hehe
Mar 27 11:43pm
My diabetes meter is still doing good too
Mar 27 11:44pm
As I am about to scrounge in the fridge for food
Mar 27 11:44pm
Yes, ma'am. I hope you have many dishes to choose from (fried chicken in particular).
Mar 27 11:45pm
Woot!
Mar 27 11:45pm
I was thinking cheddar sticks and tomato juice but who knows
Mar 27 11:45pm
That would hit the spot.
Mar 27 11:46pm
I am the only one here that drinks it but I loves it
Mar 27 11:46pm
I think the texture is what people don't like (but, I like the texture).
Mar 27 11:47pm
Or maybe too much acid. But, I like that too.
Mar 27 11:47pm
Me too
Mar 27 11:47pm
And the saltiness
Mar 27 11:47pm
Yes.
Mar 27 11:47pm
I like sundried tomatoes too. Hard to beat tomatoes. Go in almost everything.
Mar 27 11:48pm
Exactly
Mar 27 11:48pm
May have to hire a helper to plant some for me ðŸ˜Š
Mar 27 11:49pm
Hopefully, you'll have a garden-farmhouse making it all.
Mar 27 11:52pm
Goat meat is good.
Mar 27 11:52pm
Goats are not necessarily nice always from what I understand.
Mar 27 11:52pm
I havenâ€™t tried goat yet but they would be fun
Mar 27 11:52pm
I can keep them with the chickens but not the dogs...goats tend to be jumpy and skitter which makes the dogs think they are prey
Mar 27 11:53pm
Ah.
Mar 27 11:54pm
(I hate to say it, but I want to try dog too, lol)
Mar 27 11:54pm
Prim would just want to play but I would hate to find out the hard way
Mar 27 11:54pm
I have had rabbit but not dog
