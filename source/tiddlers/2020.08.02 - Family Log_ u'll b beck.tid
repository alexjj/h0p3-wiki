*** I didn't think that I was writing longer this week, but I was! I've had a log I removed this week. Again, if I wrote it I should be able to remove it. I think I've been more social this week and thought more about what I believed. I'm surprised my paper for Harry Potter and Percy Jackson met the conditions.
** j3d1h
*** I'm happy you've been writing longer, more detailed logs! Seeing such a rich point of view written down from you is nice. I really wish you'd stop calling yourself names in your logs, it's not a good habit at the very least. Your game looks interesting, and I like your pseudocode a lot! I find that's the easiest way to start writing a script, personally.
** k0sh3k
*** I felt like you talked a lot more this week on your wiki about what you were doing and feeling outside of just your school work! I think it's cool that you're planning your own game again; that's always been one of the things that made you happy. You have a bike now, yay!! I liked your exploration of the Hero's Quest; I wish you'd been able to polish up the paper and make it nice, but you got the gist of it done. I hope you pour more effort into your Hamilton paper! You didn't mention your lost tooth at all - but I hope you like your book!

*** [[1uxb0x]] might not have been massively productive, but he produced. Plus, he got some serious drugtime in on Plebbit, Slackernews, and Dicksword. He played //Alien Onboard// and //SCP: Secret Laboratory//. His room is more coherent and less likely to attract ants, and he got some cleaning done in the house. He made sketti for us and even ran an errand to the store (with a cute tiny shopping list). He spent about 10 hours outside this week, and he got some good walking in. He's been setting up dual-boot 2-in-1s, eventually his school-prison machine (and [[hope]]fully a device he'll use in college to great effect); he's had system administration on the brain. [[Something Something a Game Idea Thing]] seemed to be an <<tag "independent project">>of some joy for him. While he didn't write much about it, he's been thinking about [[Hamilton: An American Musical]] this week too. Maybe we should watch more musicals because he seemed to enjoy it.

** 1uxb0x
*** You were a good friend this week, thank you. I think you've also had a bad week. I agree with you that your art this week wasn't as good as usual, but this weeks been a week. Fair trade is cool. I think your RP thing with dad was intresting.
** j3d1h
*** I did not do a good job on my wiki or school this week. I'm happy there's something for both papers, even if it isn't much. I did have several important conversations, and quite a few fun ones as well. My art this week seems to be marginally worse than other drawings I've made, but I don't mind - they were fun to make, and helped me figure out some character design!
** k0sh3k
*** Your artwork continues to be cool. I'm glad you're recording how things like melatonin impact you; it's a good habit to develop. Yay, fair trade! I don't know whether you would like Jane Eyre or not, but you should probably read it at some point. There are several other more modern stories that use Jane Eyre as the underlying story (much as several modern mysteries use Sherlock Holmes). 
** h0p3
*** [[j3d1h]]'s looking a little bit stuck, and I'm trying to pull her out. She was helpful to her brother this week multiple times. It is also good that she has spent a ton of time RPing with her friends, and she has convinced her dad to join her as best as he autistically knows how. Let's see if her 2-in-1 will be something she enjoys. Fall begins soon enough. I am [[hope]]ful, but I do not have predictions. I openly suggest it again: you should consider speaking with [[DeathOfRobinhood]] about your work and perspective; he is a living expert in what you are doing.

** 1uxb0x
*** It sucks that you are sick, why would father do this to you? I like your RCL's. Who cares if you make a mess while eating cupcakes? That just means more is left over! It seems you get migraines at the worst times. Maybe you should take some sick days.
** j3d1h
*** Don't get COVID-19, please. I think both of these RCLs were especially good - the questions you answer are incredibly important, and I like these topics/directions even more than most! The cupcake debate is beyond stupid; the answer is to just eat the cupcake and not make a mess. You need to get some new glasses - or maybe a new brain, that could fix the problem.
** k0sh3k
*** This week was pretty miserable, health-wise. I felt just generally ill for a few days, and this weekend was a horrible migraine period (which hasn't completely ended). My not feeling well is reflected in my very short Prompted Introspections. Still, I got some work done - despite set-backs with The Plan and trouble getting straight answers on some questions. My sisters and Mom made some ridiculous statements that led to us not talking for the rest of the week (although they're talking to me today, as though nothing happened, so I guess we're back to cordiality?). Watching Hamilton with the family and walking with h0p3 were the best parts of the week.
** h0p3
*** [[k0sh3k]] has been sick this week. Sore neck, throat, migraines, dizziness, and she'll have a CV19 test tomorrow. Her offspring have pushed her to the limits, as have her extended family members and co-workers. She's been the emergency planning point-person, including policy-handling, negotiations, interdepartmental laison, and documentation; this function has been fulfilled exclusively by the directors of every other library at Yale except hers. Even for someone as competent as she is, this is a profoundly expensive task for any who has had less than 6-weeks on the ground before having to take the lead. I agree with her boss that it has been a baptism by fire (one that he benefits from by offloading his risk). It's been a tough week, and I think walks, sleep, and //Hamilton// have been the best parts of it for her.

* [[h0p3]]
** 1uxb0x
*** Thank you for allowing me to get mints. I'm happy I surprised you with how much I actually did. You have found a very cursed thing, we love it. We haven't had a good week this week. Thank you for being exceedingly patient, nice, and kind.
** j3d1h
*** Your Omegle conversations were fascinating. I would suggest that you tone your.. //you// down, for the introduction part, but I realized that would just mislead people. I'm sure you're an interesting catch for most of them. Thanks for not finishing your audits or putting your conversations into the wiki - I now have far less to read! I don't think I've gone a single week without finding something revolting in your wiki, and something just as horrific looking at your screen in passing (which, by the way, I have trouble //not// looking at when I walk by). 
** k0sh3k
*** Your philosophy class dream is so you it hurts. I'm glad we got the 2-in-1s; good luck locking them down for the kiddos. I think it's good to give them school machineships that will limit their temptation to traverse exoschoolspace. Your Omegle conversations made me literally LOL. Keep looking for your solar plexis, I guess? I'm sorry we missed shopping and our Saturday date-walk and end-of-the-month-festivities; I have a lot to make up for this week!
** h0p3
*** [[h0p3]] is not in a position to complain. Does it feel like it was a bad week? Yeah. He is very fortunate though, and an honest assessment of what merits [[gratitude]] in his context demonstrates a moral limit to the justification for expressing his feelings. His escapism must be regulated carefully, and he needs to hammer out [[Recent Obsessions]]. He needs to make sure the monthly shopping is accomplished. He needs to encourage his offspring and triage for his wife. He ought to practice breathing because it feels like a deep dive that will have to go deeper.
