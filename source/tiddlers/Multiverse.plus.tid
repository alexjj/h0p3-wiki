Hi.

My name is h0p3. It's a pleasure to meet you. I am lucky to meet lots of strangers in the world. Your name reminds me of what's important.

The following are my valuable, distinctive, and unfortunately wildly incomplete, incoherent, and unoriginal passwords and digested answers to these crucial questions (I feel 'em in my bones). All are allowed to ask me to elaborate if they wish, but they must help me think with them. If I must, I will remain monotone or quiet so as not offend anyone.

> ~> What are you hoping Multiverse will be?

Haha. Hrm. Well, I have no idea how to sum up my hopes for any multiverse. The sky is the limit: it's wide open for me. I [[like]] to think that [[reality could be brighter than I could imagine|ridtyawtr]]. I'm hoping to see explosions and maymays and poems and tall tales of gnostic ninjas and butterflies and nomads and salience-sifting-librarians and ghosts and skins-in-the-game and aliens and cheatcodes and prisms and mirrors and vomit and people attempting to pursue what matters together. Spill your guts, share your sincere fictions, play with your tools, bedazzle your junk, and show me what you got, please. 🆈 🆄 🅼.

May it be a living prayer and a sacrament. May it be 𝕱𝕴𝕽𝕰🔥 for those we love and more. May we rain down our Humanity upon The World Itself. May it be a digital haven and heaven on the wire. May it be a piece of the thing I've been looking for my entire life, a paradise (perhaps a quiet oasis) for all who would want it. May It Be Real, whatever that means.

I'm here to understand what it means to be a creature that thinks about its own existence well, and I hope to learn how to do that with those I encounter in the multiverse. I know neither my place in it nor how to flesh out what it ought to be by myself. In [[good]] [[faith]], you're going to have to help me define what I should hope for here. As a [[hope]]ful retard™ punk, I aim to be robustly empathic and light as a feather in such a cozy place with open integrity.

I wish I knew how to answer your question all the way down. I will try, if you wish.

> ~> What do you feel your purpose is for blogging and sharing things online?

I could offer a tiresome (though sufficiently rigorous and sound) answer, if you'd like (nobody wants that, nobody XD). It would take a long time to explain my unworthy point of view (there's only so much one can summarize). Yeah, that's part of my purpose. I'm trying to demonstrate what it means to be fittingly telic to myself and others as best I know how. That's what It's About, itellyawhat.

I'm a lost outsider, and as such, I have uncommon duties. At the moment, I'm curling up (though still doing what I can to meet my obligations). I'm primarily listening and in Reply Mode with the world. If [[sharing]] requires having someone to share with, then, at the moment, I'm primarily a blind lurker and beggar one would share with. That may change. We'll see.

> ~> How do you feel about gathering around a bonfire with some friends in the desert at nighttime? (Multiverse is supposed to feel like you are in the desert at nighttime.)

Mmmmmmmmm. That sounds good. That's a dope metaphor.

As long as you don't mind my silence or my gibberish, I'm sure it will feel like I'm right at home, wherever and with whomever that may be. I really like mineral water. How about you?

> ~> Without looking it up - so without consulting Google and without removing your eyes from THIS REGION OF PIXELS - which emoji goes by the name of Walt Jabsco in real life? That's WALT (or Walter) JABSCO. This is a complete test of your cognitive abilities.

I failed. Sexy beast tho. It reminds me of many things though (and, yes, memory is one of many cognitive abilities I'm trying to understand and improve upon in my own life).
