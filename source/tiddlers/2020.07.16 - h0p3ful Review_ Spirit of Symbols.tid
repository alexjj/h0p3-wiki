*[[The Lightning Thief: 21, rough draft]]
** Doesn't seem like a big difference between rough and final. Make sure there's a clear improvement.

** Hunting for things that make you happy is important. 
** I wish you had anything for the afternoon here.
*[[2020.07.15 – Prompted Introspection: Yeah, yeet]]

** Cool question. Seems like there's a lot of room to explore in it.
** I appreciate how you are considering the implications of having such a super power. It's interesting that you would aim to be deceptive about a superpower that sees through deception.
*** That merits more reasoning.
** Good work in this one, homie.

*** I hope you continue the trend of trying to express your feelings, especially when it's hard.
