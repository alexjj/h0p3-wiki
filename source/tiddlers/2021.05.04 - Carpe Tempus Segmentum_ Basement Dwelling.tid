title: 2021.05.04 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Basement Dwelling

Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Trying DarkMX out. Nostalgia. A treat from an OG. This one could write it from scratch if they saw fit. Took a while to fall asleep, and it was meh. Woke late. [[TTTOTW]], Fireman Time! Cleaning.

Play a match with my daughter. First was a wash, but the second had me scrambling. 

More DNS work. I don't have a [[Link Log]] for today. But, I need to speak with my offspring about https://opensource.com/article/21/4/opennic-internet. I admire this quite a bit, even if I do not understand it well enough. I will agree to federation of naming to bust Zooko's, but the proof must be tiny, a speed bump and never a Global Warming factor. There must be many attempts, different mutations and species even to survive. 

Asked for another recycling bin from the city. Should be here tomorrow or next week.

//The Walk//. I got the extra circle lap. A choice too, and I'm glad to walk, prefer it right now even. Insane. I often call that man a fool. He's not. Schizo walking with his wife. Annoyed an old woman by introducing myself. We said "hi," and I said, "I'm [[REDACTED]], blah blah." That was the end. It was disconcerting for her. I am a robot, an autistic freak, who would say hello to me? And, yet:  [[WR|https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/n3fb5s/advice_my_boomer_parents_gave_me_which_i_realize/gwy2q3x/]]'s message was crystal. I cannot do such a thing, nothing even close to that. 

Wife was anxious. A mixture pumping through her. High praise, of course, but the implication is expensive. We just fucking got here. A has confirmed my ~~hypothesis~~ bias. Of course she's a fucking rockstar. She may move again, climb or crawl or swim, as we do. He was very surprised to hear the intention to stay. Reminds me of another mentor of hers. I have asked her to reason about what she thinks isn't possible for her, the edge, the limit, and just consider if it were. It might. It is often enough to merit the exploration. An interaction where "I gave up on perfection" is exactly the opposite of what I'd agree to in her. I understand it must be said in some cases. Shibboleth, maybe. For the first time, we do not have to move for survival, so it seems. Nervewracking to think about. We've had to move a lot. It seems to get harder. Even now, I build on the assumption that I am renting from the bank. Hard to fittingly prepare for any shock. We move forward though, and so far, so good.

Continuing to shape [[The Alien Asylum]] and be a rock makes some good sense. I've long respected [[CH]] and [[R]] for this. We disagree about a lot, but not that. They lived for people other than themselves, for real. They actually mean it. They really did take care of the most needy among them quite directly. They've done something with what they've had that I admire and I hope I would be successful at as well.

[[Family Gathering]], sans [[5c0ut]], but saved him a plate. Noodles, veggies, spring rolls, and water. Talk was good. 

Son and I spent much of the evening working in the basement. Chilled for a while cause my head was killing me. He didn't mind. Just wandered.
