title: 2020.05.04 - Prompted Introspection: Cringe & Wince

!! What caused me to wince today?

[[2018.08.23 - Prompted Introspection: Wince]] still causes me to wince. That happens with both my offspring. Kill me now, please. This question is no fun. That's okay; it's my duty.

Tiktok videos cause me to cringe and wince often enough, including today. I think I'm a masochist sometimes. I have no room to talk. There is a sense in which I could not be more exhibitionistic here. I suppose there is some delight in trying to figure out when someone is being serious on the internet. I'm especially prone to believe when I ought not.
