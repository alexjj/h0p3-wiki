//Damn, girl, are you a microwave? because mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, <3. I love you.//

Voting Experts, I Call Upon You:

* Eliminating poor people != Eliminating poverty
* Rule of the people != Rule of the market
* Rule of law != Rule of radically centralized political [[power]]
* Moral != Legal
* Justified Law != Legal Positivist's Law

I wonder if mass media's highlighting of Asian-American hate crimes will only increase the rate of them. Further, I wonder the [[dok]] to which this branch of animosity is influenced by the CCP through shells of shills and false flags.

I know, I know, I know: my passion, it's just SO hawt or disastrously nourishing. Breathe and live on purpose. Often people only look and touch because they want one too. Covetous whores. y u m. Okay, fine. This is our penis. We can share it together. Who does not wish to know what the enduring performance of their lives is for? Transmute the immutable desire for fire into self-immolation.

Of course, I think the //hard//est part of writing this ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 is dodging all the mixed signal used panties that get thrown at me by the thirsty-ass [[anonymous]] bitches and hoes. At what point does streaking (either on foot or in one's underwear, and y not both, really?) become a form of protest, celebration, or foreplay? Let's just take the red and blue pills at the same time. Get this party started! Surely, the most based forms of communism require we lick each other's armpits with joy, verve, and fervor. With her whole mouth, my cat, Chairman Meow, agrees. Do you really want to know the ethical implications of OOO in this space? Lawd. Spread that essence.
