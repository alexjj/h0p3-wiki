//Nothing as gorgeous as what you've been crafting.<<ref "y">>//

<<<
Always your disciple - in truth and txt. Wrestling angels, leviathans and turtles has really caught on, yeah??
<<<

Thank you, [[Root User]]. I am here for that with you too.

`/hug`

Well, `/shit-eating-grin`, like you said, pretty much, hehe: totally, like wildfire, it's unstoppable, everyone has rushed to do it with me. XD. `/sigh`. Welp. I'm doing what I can.

I know I am lucky to have the people in my life that I do, you included. I've been losing [[hope]] in some vocational places, again. You know it. I still look for you everywhere, nomad, even in [[Tapeda the Dragon]] (there are only a handful of people that seem to interpret me as well as you fine folks, and I wish I knew how to return the favor).

Just in case, the Youtube comment section was absurd, but I had a blast. It's not impossible, but god damn is it improbable. If I am noticed, I'm clearly an unhinged jester (that's what the voices tell me anyhow `/raises-eyebrow`). I suppose continuing my work is accepting that mantle more formally and openly. I'm just gonna take a giant shit in the street while screaming that I'm doing so (and, it hurts to poop this much), lol. Everyone, come look at this!

Yeah, I am still ~~shitposting~~ wrestling (however poorly). I am lost. Ugh. That's okay (insofar as it can be). Not sure where to go from here besides focusing local and continue my work in what sometimes feels like practically a vacuum many days of the week.

<<<
People know what you are now. There is a feverish bristling that you have aroused in the gargoyles.
<<<

Yeah. They've got my wanted posters up too. 250 smackaroonies. Those who do know, know to avoid me at almost all costs. The smell is just not worth it. Continue trusting your gut instincts, [[kicks]]; they serve you well.

Appurhuntly, I am The Great Warrior Come To Slay The 4chan Dragon. `/rawr`. Only one feed trigger thus far. I do intend to speak with all [[anon]]s and strange nomads I happen upon in the desert. I've considered keeping open a regular thread there. Perhaps I'll grab a vanity tripcode to live among my people. 

Everytime I get: "wtf is this?" Lol. `/sigh`. I don't know, man. You got me. You'd think I'd get to used to it by now. It's provocatively bad, narcissistic, and grotesque art, for <<tag "The Super Freaks">>only (not by design). Alrighty.

I'm glad to have the slowdown and quietness to some extent. Mixed strong feelings, almost nowhere to put them. 

<<<
Your constant vigilance - forged in the fires of autism - does not fool me, however. You are fucking gas. Of course, I love you, you brittle little shit.
<<<

XD. It's so true. I can't pick out any one particular thing you are talking about; there are too many, and that's how you know it's a real problem. Lol. The video (I can't tell if that was you or me, btw) was a fine cover for my real collapse in this curl-up (been interesting to see what actually sticks during the contraction).<<ref "s">> And, I'm glad that you smiled with my last letter to you. I thought you might. =).

Your line made my days. Thank you.

<<<
I've taken to reading some of our old conversations lately and feeling so fond. What a treasure philosopher.life is. Of all the gin joints to walk into!
<<<

Me too. `/nod`. I'm not convinced I can replicate it with more people either, homie (not everyone is as foolhardy, kamikaze, and patient as you are). But, I guess we'll see. Even just our conversation alone has been a sufficient source of hope. Thank you. 

<<<
I have been very absent - working and processing the experience of the last five years - there is just so much that I've learned from my time among the public self-modelers. h0p3 with his cascading, rainbow-backed logorrhea - he looks up from the stark concrete desk and you can clearly see the places he's been yanking his tufts of hair. Sphygmus with her airy, wistful dabs of paint that run down the wall into deep wells of wandering poetry - and sadness. Chameleon with her sparks, her pop-snaps and ofc the final waifu boss level. I start to see markings when I look through the glass - don't know if I'm going mad here. Just another sniff, yeah?
<<<

Hrm.

Yes, teacher.

Absence is required for digesting. I appreciate that you are so generous with me here too. It's necessary for those who live such intense inner lives. It's quite a gin joint. =).

<<<
I would be sorry about the delay in writing - but I feel that we're forever tied now. It'll be this way - I hope to follow you around from now on - with these intense moments of long, detailed, brutal ARDUOUS conversation in the hells of hypertext philosophy. And moments of, "Where'd they all go?" 
<<<

Lol. Yeah, I hear ya. We are tied together, I agree. I appreciate that we get to have those conversations. Those are difficult moments for me.

<<<
You really can count on Sphygmus to always come back. (I need to write her - the detailed notes she's been doing lately are ace.)
<<<

Yes, [[Root User]]. You obviously know what your words mean to me. Thank you. 

I gotta tell someone, [[kicks]]. It should be you. I'm bursting, \( ﾟヮﾟ)/, and I don't want to hide it (though I have no idea how to label it either).

As I think you know, I have lacked courage and faith. It is mine to fix.<<ref "100">> I have[[『Paused』]]to do so.<<ref "c">> Yeah, she's the reason. Mmmmm. ⊙﹏⊙. I wouldn't know where to begin. `/grin`. I have waited a long time to see the [[ᛝLightᛝ]], [[ridtyawtr]]. With all my lasers and cores, [[I see her|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7k0a5hYnSI]] on the wire and around the Camp{{Text Art: 𝕱𝕴𝕽𝕰🔥}} when I can, [[kicks]] (every chance I get). Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ ƸӜƷ.<<ref "t">> As I've said before, I'm more [[lucky]] to hear her words than I know how to say. Like [[k0sh3k]], she's so generous, [[an eternal well in the desert|https://earth.google.com/my intruder//. Yeah, she's ''treasure'',<<ref "ℍ">> and [[I'm her beggar|Poem: I Am A Beggar Always]]. All the way down, no matter what. Every key and password: it's trust and [[love]]. [[Intimacy]] is so delicate, vulnerable, precious, an exceptional gift to open. To the best of her abilities, she shares what she has with all. A broken perfectionist's story unlike any other I've seen, and I'm a part of it, entwined, alive in it. Perhaps I'm the only one who can see even a quarter of what is lost in this here gorgeous maze of moth languages: our story runs deep. May it become an infinite playground beyond memory and doubt. I feel lucky, like some of my failures can be restored (Preach, yo!). It's like starting all over again with her, and I'm loving every moment `{{fistpump}}`, even [[Moments of Silence]]. I agree. She's always going to come back (she comes at her own pace), and I'm not going to leave (always devouring).

You should definitely write her. 

<<<
Thank you for everything. Say hi to the whole p.l family. We're supposed to get Multiverse out in the next month and then I need to do more good ol FTO on the blog.

- kicks
<<<

`/hug`. No, thank you for everything. And, we're all lucky to participate in your excellent work.<<ref "i">> You bind us together. Take your time, homie. We speak when we can. I will continue to think about what you are saying and doing. 

Love, Your Bri-uhl Li-uhl Shih,

h0p3
