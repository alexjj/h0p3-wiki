You don't want the effects of incels being forced to internalize the cognitive dissonance of saying "I don't desire you"? Have some empathy. I'll say it again: charity and state-sponsored prostitution will help fight exploitative mating markets and markets that abuse the factors of unmet desire. It might not be curable, but we can alleviate their suffering (and, yes, their suffering matters). Feed them, wash their "feet", and go the extra mile.

How often is multi-agent RPing the gamification and simulation of socializing? There's nothing conceptually wrong with that, as long as one does not treat [[the other]] as mere means.

Those in [[power]] have as much self-regulatory control over using people as mere means as the public has of enabling those in [[power]] to do so. That amount is non-zero.

Like my idol, I can only hope that mediocreboi is a remarkably average and deeply adequate NPC. `/grin`. Have I told you that you are the most [[anonymous]] giver I've met? Still [[PSM]]ing. I can't say I understand you, but I understand your work enough to know I respecc it/you/symbol_here more than I know hao to put into words, my ninja.

Not all failures to yawn back in the contagious mimesis of behavioral styles that promote tribal bonding are due to a lack of moral empathy.
