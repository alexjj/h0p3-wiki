Long time no talk! How are you doing today?
May 26 3:30pm
I’m starting summer classes Monday officially and work is coming to an end in a few months. Then student teaching! I’m going to be helping with three honors classes and two dual credit high school classes so I assume all of my students will be really excited/passionate about writing. I’m totally stoked. 

[[L]] is carving through big work projects and seems much happier these days so I am also thankful for that. 

How is everyone down there going? How are your own projects?
May 26 3:33pm
Yo!
May 26 4:45pm
<3.
May 26 4:45pm
I'm doing well. Busy day. [[j3d1h]] is working on selling a car, so I'm facilitating that.
May 26 4:45pm
Reading and writing, my usual.
May 26 4:45pm
Trying to be the glue of the house.
May 26 4:46pm
Your student teaching sounds awesome!
May 26 4:46pm
It's a pleasure working with much of the cream of the crop.
May 26 4:47pm
What classes do you have left in total?
May 26 4:47pm
I'm partially* sad to hear that your work at the library will be coming to an end. It was a good gig.
May 26 4:47pm
What have you been up to this past month?
May 26 4:48pm
I am glad to hear that [[L]] is feeling happier.
May 26 4:49pm
Hopefully, not needing to quarantine to the same extent has brightened her days.
May 26 4:49pm
I think we're still settling into the house. Offspring are more on their own now. Painful to watch, but necessary.
May 26 4:50pm
It sounds like pieces are coming together for you, building the life you want.
May 26 4:52pm
She’s selling a car?! How did that happen? Lol

I have four technically but one of those is literally student teaching and another is capstone. Probably just reflecting on student teaching haha. 

I am also sad. I love working at the library but they don’t want to keep me so, lol. 

I’ve taken a much needed vacation and I have begun coursework in advance once more. One of my professors opened the class early so I’m forging ahead.  

And aye for [[L]]. Being vaccinated means we can be out and about more which is helpful. 

And yeah. As the kids get older it’s natural for them to be more reclusive haha. XD

Yeah! I’m excited to see how this year ends. :)
May 26 6:53pm
I think I answered all of your questions lol.
May 26 6:53pm
Ah, she's selling the Honda. Getting 10% of what she sells it for. Good practice for her.
May 26 6:55pm
I hope the classes will be useful. Student teaching sounds the most useful of them, by far.
May 26 6:55pm
I'm sorry they won't be keeping you. I assume they might be under budgetary pressures or something.
May 26 6:55pm
I’m really glad they won’t just be general English classes. I was worried that I would have to field students who weren’t interested about the class.
May 26 6:56pm
And yeah. Definitely budget. They also just require a certain degree to work there and I don’t have it.
May 26 6:56pm
=/. Yup.
May 26 6:56pm
I assume you've been building contacts and trying to find schools you'd want to teach at.
May 26 6:57pm
You get any gaming time in during your vacation?
May 26 7:00pm
Not really surprisingly enough. It’s been difficult to make those connections online. Those I have collaborated with are with schools I am uninterested in teaching in. 

But I’m also applying to be a substitute so I’m hoping I can try a lot of different schools out!
May 26 7:00pm
Oh yes. PLENTY haha.
May 26 7:01pm
I played Nier Replicant, Resident Evil Village, and currently SMT Nocturne HD.
May 26 7:01pm
XIV is gearing up for a new expansion too.
May 26 7:01pm
Noice.
May 26 7:02pm
What kinda schools you looking for?
May 26 7:02pm
You might be able to teach online as well, but that might not be something you'd want.
May 26 7:02pm
Honestly just something close to home with people who genuinely care about teaching and the students.
May 26 7:03pm
Yes, sir.
May 26 7:03pm
I never considered that online teaching was an option.
May 26 7:03pm
That might require a lot more effort and marketing than I’m willing to exhibit though. Haha
May 26 7:03pm
Lots of options there, including tutoring. It's really not the same, imho.
May 26 7:04pm
Will be cool to grow roots there, be a pillar of your community.
May 26 7:05pm
Your family doing alright?
May 26 7:05pm
Yeah. I’m not as interested in tutoring right now. Field hours killed that drive FAST haha. 

Family is doing more or less well. I have a new nephew so that’s nice. :) he was born legitimately a few weeks ago. He’s TINY.
May 26 7:07pm
Congratz, sir. That is fantastic.
May 26 7:08pm
Most definitely. :)
May 26 7:23pm
How many times an uncle are you now?
May 26 7:37pm
It's been a special feeling watching [[JRE]] with his two from afar.
May 26 7:38pm
Fourth? I think. Yeah!
May 26 9:19pm
How is [[JRE]] doing these days?
May 26 9:19pm
Damn, son. That is awesome. I bet your family gatherings are extra special.
May 26 9:19pm
He's been super busy, imho.
May 26 9:20pm
Starting a new job working waste treatment. Adoption for [[Bn]] went through.
May 26 9:20pm
Having little ones burns all his energy.
May 26 9:20pm
He's happy though.
May 26 9:20pm
I think there's a different fire in his belly these days.
May 26 9:21pm

Cute AF* ofc
May 26 9:23pm

😂
[[Bn]]'s learning to talk more, and [[Q]] is huge (like, chonky chungus 99th percentile big baby, almost toddler).
May 26 9:24pm
[[Rb]] is doing alright. Hopefully, she'll be leaving her soul-crushing job soon enough. She's gonna head back to school, I think, for radiology.
May 26 9:25pm
They've been working on their house, got a new deck (looks pretty dope). Yard has a fence now, and it's safer for the little ones to do their thing.
May 26 9:26pm
That’s good to hear. Things seem to be looking up for them. :)
