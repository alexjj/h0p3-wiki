title: 2021.09.02 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Ida

[[TTTOTW]] + LolVod + pets for Ranga.<<ref "h">> Lots of poop today. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! Finished the LCS Championship. [[TTTOTW]] with a [[Wiki Audit]] on the [[Yearly X-Section]] (I didn't get it done on the weekend). It's quite a trip. I'm still considering whether or not I will have [[Retroactive Footnotes]] in [[Letters]] and [[Notes]]. 

She's up. Bright-eyed for there being such a terrible storm. She doesn't like her hair today,<<ref "t">> and I think she's feeling frazzled this morning. Between PT and Greek, an earlier bedtime, the new semester transitions (and the first one that seems almost normal, before Covid, even though it isn't), and her extra hiring duties (e.g. she's been roped into interviewing a UX dev for something), it's not slowing down. Her head is well above water though. I had millennial toast with her. I stole as many XOXOs as I was allowed.

[[TTTOTW]]. Prep for dinner. Sleep by unknown time. It was late.

Woke at 2:30. It was enough. Meditation. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. [[Morning Routine]].

//The Walk// with my offspring. Jessica greeted us full shields, but casual like. This is the third time we've heard parents talking about bus schedules being off. The weather is so much better. It's not blazing hot. Suggesting finding a friend who is a good student. Thinking about our social lives. Son did his work. Vapelyfe. Lots of argumentation (surprise!) :P. [[JRE]] called mid-walk, and I took it (so it literally became just walking with them [which is pleasant]). Spent social capital to correct an error about regulations from the poly atheist (who apparently has a very odd expertise in these estimating these systems and apparently gets strange on the job too :P), and his mentor pulled him aside to chastise him for arguing for truth rather than getting the job done (roughly also pointing out that as a black man, he's punished even harder for those moves). Had a box blow on him, and he took responsibility for something that wasn't entirely his fault (co-worker said he wasn't going to rat on him, and my brother made the argument that he'd rather normalize being able to take responsibility, but...that's not going to happen). [[Bn]] is putting multiple words together and saying complex words like "umbrella." Potty training seems to be going alright. He's thinking about how to explain to his offspring that their biodad (or one of them) is a murderer (with a fucking pocketknife, no less). Their social worker quit and didn't put through the audit paperwork for [[Q]], so they are floating again. Biomom is in jail, so it's an unpleasant situation again. [[Rb]] needs a computer for school (since what she has is garbage), and we eventually found some recommendations. A discussion of being open about our pornographic tastes with our SOs, which isn't always so easy. 

Assignments. Son seems to have everything but the data moved (and my wife doesn't know, so he's gonna have to use his judgment).

Working on her alphabet and transliteration (could have been casting demonic spells for all I know, as it is all Greek to me [I won't get tired of this joke]). Thinking about [[Zeugmas]]. She's got her universal "oriental" accent turned on as she mutters the sounds (it's very fancy).<<ref "g">> 

She came down after doing her first section of homework. Crazy day. Ida's flooding in the library wasn't bad, but it required dealing with lots of people (also, things are in full swing, tons of people in the library - her students are tracking headcounts for her [one person was almost handed from students to S for not wearing a mask; that woman won't take shit). My wife had to work with collections destroyed by Katrina, so she's extra sensitive to the problems associated with flooding (I'm glad they listen to her - eventually, they'll learn to ignore the fact that she's female<<ref "d">> [oh, the techbros apparently required convincing to move toward open access repos for theses {she's had to fight the same problems at Milligan, including convincing the incompetent}, but after having it handed to them on a platter, they eventually coughed up what was owed]). Thinking about what it's like being one the older people in the classroom. //Inform the Men!// Meditation. [[TTTOTW]].

My offspring were taking too long. They are easily distracted. On task. Got to hear and see [[5c0ut]] some; he seems to be in a decent mood. She finished her homework. If she doesn't go this route, she'd be required to do a summer 6-week intensive (which is basically infeasible with her job). 

[[Family Gathering]] was pleasant. We had sketti, salad, and ubermelon (unfortunately, gone bad). Oh, dark chocolate, too! =). //House// and //Skintime// (I make a reasonable chair...smother me while I devour you).

[[TTTOTW]] + LCK Regionals. Saw everyone, including [[5c0ut]] incidentally, off to bed. It's 11. Gonna try to sleep too.
