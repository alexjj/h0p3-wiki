title: 2020.05.20 - Wiki Review: Experiment

* [[Plato]]
** I'm going to wait on this one.
* [[Socrates]]
** This may be a dumb idea, but I think there could be a skeleton to begin with.
* [[Zeno of Elea]]
** It's an experiment.
* [[Democritus + Leucippus]]
** Ditto
* [[Protagoras]]
** Ditto
* [[Empedocles]]
** Ditto
* [[Parmenides]]
** Ditto
* [[Heraclitus]]
** Ditto
* [[Xenophanes]]
** Ditto
* [[Pythagorus]]
** Ditto
* [[Anaximenes]]
** Ditto
* [[Anaximander]]
** Ditto
* [[Thales]]
** Ditto
* [[Philosophers]]
** Not sure if I need this if I have the timeline...
* [[Timelines: Philosophers]]
** I am not sure how inclusive I need to be. Seems to explode at the tail-end too.
* [[2020.04.18 - Magnus: o/\o]]
** [[MTG]]-players unite! =)
* [[Magnus]]
** It's good to meet him. Wondering if [[k0sh3k]] and [[chameleon]] would like to meet. 
** [[Magnus]] and I are geeks, immediately my brother in this.
* [[2020.05.13 - GClark: Odd Emotions]]
** I assume this is a conversation starter. Not sure how to open the door further with him there.
* [[2020.05.09 - GClark: Exploring People Online]]
** Likely schizotypal, and he's profoundly self-aware. I enjoy listening to him reason in that space.
* [[2020.05.07 - GClark: Out of the Blue]]
** Some people do not handle having a bunch of links thrown at them well. He does. He explored too. A lot of people just shut it down immediately. Oh noes, this person is really different, thus it can't really be worth my time. He doesn't make that mistake. I appreciate that about him. Perhaps he will join [[chameleon]] and me in [[The Super Freaks]]? =)
* [[2020.04.01 - chameleon: Nightowls]]
** Her mom sounds so much like my wife in that respect. My wife calls herself //Bookwyrm//. I think the world of fantasy is a place that my wife and [[chameleon]] would get along really well. 
*** Actually, my wife might even be somewhere around [[chameleon]]'s mom's age.
* [[2020.04.03 - chameleon: The Super Freaks]]
** Do I get a costume tho? I'm not even sure what it would be. 
*** h0p3 the Vindicator. I have no idea what my superhero powers would be. All I know is that I don't like Batman. Fuck him.
** Hopefully, one day we will have one clean P2P channel. 
* [[2020.04.11 - chameleon: Cuddles]]
** Dogs are especially expensive to my eyes too. =/. Sucks.
*** Hopefully, a year or two from now, her situation will be way different. She's had huge curveballs thrown at her, taking it in stride too.
* [[2020.04.14 - chameleon: The Birth]]
** I wish I knew what maymays to pick for her. That's not one of my skills for anyone. 
** I do not send pictures of family to almost anyone. It is an extremely rare treat.
*** If it weren't for my wife on FB (yet again), I don't think any one would know what we look like.
* [[2020.04.18 - chameleon: Books & Games]]
** I wonder how she picks how games. I'm hoping that she will continue to develop that section of her wiki too. She's deep in the culture.
* [[2020.04.21 - chameleon: Social Convention]]
** I appreciate her fair appraisal. That is the kind of approval I hope to seek. It's my honor to have a [[Root User]] like her. 
* [[2020.04.26 - chameleon: Emacs 1b]]
** I'd like to know her take on the other tooling in this space.
* [[2020.04.14 - dziggetai: Wikitalk]]
** I wish a lot of these plugins would work. I've not really made significant changes in a while. Our last plunge failed quite a bit.
* [[2020.04.09 - Ovy: Cool Kids]]
** Was it the crisis that brought him out of the woodwork to speak with me?
* [[2020.05.19 - Wiki Audit: The Urge]]
** I'd like to see at least some basic tagging each day for the [[Dynamic]] content.
* [[Nifty]]
** I suppose I need to pick things out of stream to decorate the garden.
** I'm surprised that my brother [[JRE]] did not find this obvious or compelling. Hrm. It wasn't was he predicted. I don't know what he was predicting.
* [[2020.05.19 - h0p3ful Review: Esoteric Homefry]]
** I am glad he does not give up. He works through a special hell with me.
* [[2020.05.19 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: God Damnit, Jesus]]
** Since then, she does not make coffee for me, lol.
* [[2020.05.19 - Wiki Review: Bert + Ernie = Bernie]]
** Arguably, I'm an unfun friend in most spaces.
* [[2020.05.19 - TDL: Hunt]]
** I tell people that, and they don't outright say I'm crazy. Lol. 
* [[2020.05.19 - Prompted Introspection: Madman]]
** We've been eating a lot of pasta. Feels like more than usual.
* [[2020.05.19 - h0p3ful Review: R E S P E C T]]
** If I didn't have CV19 in January, I'm concerned it will hospitalize me. I'm pre-emptively dosing vitamin D.
* [[Neat]]
** This is a compromise. The major inferences are not in these. These are just shiny. What I find useful, ofc, is not what [[others]] will.
