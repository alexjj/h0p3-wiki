How's your week been?
Jul 17 1:03pm
Hey, good, if a little packed. A social occasion didn't come through yesterday night so we took a much needed relaxing walk in a park instead.
Jul 17 6:38pm
Both of our animators had their contracts extended several months which I'm very happy about!
Jul 17 6:39pm
I'm ready to hope for anything now!
Jul 17 6:39pm
And you?
Jul 17 6:39pm
Dope!
Jul 17 6:46pm
Congratz, sir. That is awesome. I hope they it will be a special place for you 4. I am glad you have the opportunity to work together.
Jul 17 6:47pm
How was the problem with not having access to the files you needed?
Jul 17 6:47pm
I'm doing good. I'm thinking, walking a lot. Got to show [[k0sh3k]] the camp. I'm hoping she'll enjoy it (she really, really despises camping, has ever since she was a young one).
Jul 17 6:57pm
Yeah, we got access to the files. The guy popped in from his vacation to transfer them to us
Jul 17 7:35pm
Excellent.
Jul 17 7:35pm
Are you planning on having access to the internet camping? Or is the point to be totally inaccessible and non-access-abled?
Jul 17 7:36pm
I'm not sure for myself. It will be up to the family what they do here. I'm still thinking about it.
Jul 17 7:37pm
I think just having our wikis and maybe music would be all I would really need for it. That can be done without the interwebs.
Jul 17 7:38pm
I suppose I could just bring the guitar or banjo instead.
Jul 17 7:38pm
Paper and pen would work too.
Jul 17 7:39pm
How many days since you've started your wiki have you not published a public update?
Jul 17 7:39pm
None.
Jul 17 7:39pm
This feels like you're doing a *big* thing
Jul 17 7:39pm
Well, let me take that back. I have had failures in my infrastructures.
Jul 17 7:39pm
I could survive on paper and pencil for the crucial problems, namely writing about my day and dreaming about the next.
Jul 17 7:40pm
[[Review]]s and [[Prompted Introspection]]s can happen out of order, much closer to a quota.
Jul 17 7:41pm
I like how you've defined 'problems' in this case
Jul 17 7:43pm
Like the usage of the word 'problem' in bouldering: A chaos of coloured rocks your body needs to sequence properly.
Jul 17 7:44pm
If I am lucky, that is a profoundly apt metaphor. Sometimes it more like drowning than climbing a mountain. But, I agree it is instrumental reasoning toward the categorical, [[WINTCIS]].
Jul 17 7:45pm
Where did you find that metaphor?
Jul 17 7:48pm
I don't know. I went bouldering with my brother in law yesterday, so it's been on my mind
Jul 17 7:52pm
I love it.
Jul 17 7:53pm
You know, as a colorblind person, the coloration of my world isn't as vivid as the norm. I imagine that tetrachromats and those who paint worlds tend to see more color than I can imagine. I would be willing to describe visual phenomenology as "a chaos of colored substance(s) my mind needs to sequence properly." When I squint, it seems like a motivating example metaphor about how we evolved too.
Jul 17 7:57pm
I have exceptional vision. I can read things on signs from distances that most people can't. This despite spending an incredible amount of my time as a child watching tv and reading books. Like, Adam, I did not have to kill successively for generations to achieve my clear-sightedness. It was given to me 'ex-nihilo'.
Jul 17 8:03pm
I am not surprised to find you have excellent vision. Pilots also tend to have excellent vision.
Jul 17 8:37pm
I cannot speak to that interpretation of Adam.
Jul 17 8:37pm
I will agree that our vision of metaphysics is dependent upon metaphysics in multiple respects.
Jul 17 8:38pm
I kind of wanted to see what you would do with sudden brazenness. A brazen-brag.
Jul 17 8:39pm
Lol. I don't think it was much of a brag; it's a fact!
Jul 17 8:40pm
A big bag of raisin breads
Jul 17 8:40pm
What are you doing tonight?
Jul 17 8:41pm
Mostly just thinking, lol. Just got back from a mini-walk with wife around our neighborhood because she just got done with her bookclub. It was exactly what she needed. I'm relieved.
Jul 17 8:42pm
I'm reading and writing too.
Jul 17 8:42pm
Probably going to watch some MasterChef porn while I do.
Jul 17 8:42pm
Since [[k0sh3k]] seems especially interested in it.
Jul 17 8:43pm
How about you? What's your plans for the weekend?
Jul 17 8:43pm
We're just sitting in the living room. Our door is open and there's a nice breeze coming in. Selah is reading a novel, I just finished disco Elysium.
Jul 17 8:44pm
Noice. How are you feeling about it?
Jul 17 8:45pm
Tomorrow, we are meeting a couple of friends at the park. Made contact with someone selling a bike online and will go check it out.
Jul 17 8:46pm
Well, I just just finished it. Like, credits rolling finished.
Jul 17 8:46pm
The ending kind of crept up on me, and now I wished I'd spent more time investigating some of the secondary storylines
Jul 17 8:47pm
It jerked me into some unexpected emotional and conceptual spaces.
Jul 17 8:49pm
The game is not particularly optimistic or idealistic in its outlook, but I appreciate that it acknowledged my attempt to play 'good', and I feel my choices were rewarded.
Jul 17 8:50pm
And that I've left a thousand doors unopened, hah
Jul 17 8:51pm
To clarify. The world isn't idealistic, but the creators don't strike me as particularly misanthropic. Even the worst characters are handled with humanity.
