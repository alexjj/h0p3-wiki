I'll agree that class is non-trivially concerned with mere status-signaling, aesthetic, and internalized faux-etiquette, especially insofar as these spectacles enable them to cost-efficiently maintain the centralization of [[power]] through appearance. Yes, that's part of why people go so far into debt to maintain veils of status. Most any tradesperson making the same amount of money as white-collar employees doesn't move up in class-signaling in virtue of their wealth. There are multiple kinds of capital, and even money never abstracts the real^^tm^^ capital or universal [[power]] that capitalists are after well enough. Also, tradespersons work much, much harder in my experience, they are less likely to own the means of production (including through stock markets), and they endanger their lives and bodies as slaves considerably more (which comes with risks for their futures and their families that most white-collars I've met are completely out of touch with). That pale skin of yours buys you a lot, including avoiding hard work. Signaling is the major game though. I'll agree that white-collar workers who pour their resources into bribery, self-marketing, mastering framing conversations for the sake of persuasion, and constructing asymmetries in responsibilities tend to be successful sociopaths. I'll even agree that political [[power]] is significantly driven by mere social constructions that exist solely for signaling. Lastly, I'll agree that cultural practices (including pursuits of religion and moral philosophy) will often be co-opted and warped to facilitate centralizing economic activity. An ideologically rich and historically complex tradition will tend to be transformed into something that either facilitates consumption of some sort or helps to increase productivity. This is why I'm so severely concerned with ideologies that cannot be co-opted by egoists. Status anxiety or depression is not irrational by definition (though some deserve to feel bad), particularly when an inequality obtains in virtue of knowing that one has been dehumanized or treated as mere means. Again, not all pain is equal. We must prioritize and triage our [[shared]] needs, [[WINTCIS]].
