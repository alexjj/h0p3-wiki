My wife has been taking fewer anxiety meds, and her emotions have been stronger. Less zombie, more her. I know it's painful for her, but I'm also glad to have her as herself.

School has still been...sad. But, it's not like they aren't learning at all. Ups and downs there (you'd think I'd learn that lesson by now).
Aug 14 5:17pm
That's good to hear. I'm glad. Hopefully it will get better and better
Aug 14 5:17pm

Sorry I was spraying the school. Pretty good how are you?
Aug 21 5:10pm
Is it extra difficult for you? I imagine there's some extra duties.
Aug 21 5:11pm
I'm doing pretty good too.
Aug 21 5:11pm
It's not really difficult it's just more time consuming and a little bit as far as preparing to spray. It's some pretty wicked stuff
