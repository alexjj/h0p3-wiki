title: 2021.12.06 - Prompted Introspection: Out For Summer

!! What did you do as a child when school let out for the summer?

I played a lot outdoors. I was regularly darkly tanned. We'd play some in the food gardens, and where allowed, I'd take the tobacco sticks and whack things. Sometimes we'd head down to the Mannsville Store^^tm^^ for a drink (25 cents for a can) when we decided to spend some of our savings.<<ref "f">> I wish we were encouraged to read, write, and use our Commodore 64 during this time. My donors preferred not to have to deal with us though, and dare I say it, I think they were non-trivially anti-intellectual in how they bought into the noble savage, probably reeling from the culture shock too. So, they sent us outside so we wouldn't bother them. Talk about a wasted childhood. Not entirely up to me. I think [[5c0ut]] probably got hit the hardest of the bunch in the end. As I have said before, //The War// did a fine job of picking out what our impoverished summers felt like. A few Southern Gothic creators have done an alright job of it too, I suppose.

I spent plenty of time at Ms. Mozel's and with [[Krystal Wilson and Caren Cox|2018.03.21 - Prompted Introspection Log: First Kiss]]. RIP to the first two. `/vapelyfe`. I know Caren tried to find me many years ago. She went military. There'd be no way to explain who I am to this woman; even if she became someone who enjoyed reading, the gap is too much. I prefer to preserve the sweet, golden amber memory of this girl. She was actually a good person, and I couldn't bare to have that memory tarnished. Unfortunately, the boys in the neighborhood were mostly shits and assholes (though fighting was fairly uncommon). Not much [[hope]] in that town. 

Eventually, I was able to use a computer consistently (with access to the web!). Some variation of that has dominated all my summers since.

<<footnotes "f" "I have fond memories of this store (though upon analysis, you will find the deep undercurrents of Southern Gothic evil), including the nearly naked ladies on the gambling machines, the cigarette candies, and the knife I won. That tiny section of that tiny 600 person town felt like a western downtown (and, of course, many people had cowboy hats, etc.)">>
