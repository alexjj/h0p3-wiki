title: 2021.08.17 - Antipleonasm Analysis: Loving The Other As Yourself

!! Respond to [[the following|Why Not A Wide Area Network, Watson?]]:

<<<
[T]he relationship of self to other is the complete realization that loving yourself is impossible without loving everything defined as other than yourself.
<<<

I highly doubt you hold a definition of [[love]] like mine (and, in my experience, those who weakly or systematically take up your stance-at-large don't actually [[love]] anyone in practice [though your rhetoric does enable your flock to achieve those warm fuzzies, ofc]). I feel like you've lifted or even misappropriated these words.<<ref "i">> Qua New Criticism, however, stripped of its context and hurled into mine ([[lucky]] you, bucko), I'm enamored with this sentence. 

It is not the case that the relationship itself is reducible to the realization, and even the realization is not necessarily the practical actualization and implementation of that knowledge. I am quite [[flawed|fff]] in trying to make this problem explicit myself, so I have little room to talk. The sentiment, however, is something I admire. 

There is a unification consideration in The Kingdom of Ends, as Saint Aristotle has thoroughly asked us to consider in anticipation of his second coming (not Saint Aquinas* but Saint Kant himself) and charitable axiological [[reconstruction]] of [[Saint Plato]]'s [[Good]].<<ref "u">> Insofar as we are committed to wielding our autonomy (the seed of our dignity) to be categorically justified, the claim may be correct, especially if we reinterpret what it means to "love" non-ends-in-themselves in a virtue-theoretic sense (i.e. to be the kind of person that is morally motivated and behaves as such, even if not directly toward that which cannot be a valid target of [[love]], but for the sake of how they aim to treat their own agency, which can be functionally identical or nearly so).<<ref "b">>

Further, I take this to be an attack on conveniently misguided cliches such as "you can't love someone until you love yourself."<<ref "t">> It gets at the heart of the matter: we really can't [[love]] ourselves without loving [[the other]].<<ref "n">> It is the hilarious paradox that egoism cannot complete itself by definition (no matter how ad hoc the argument). The CI is fundamentally concerned with not making an exception of ourselves, coming right up next to the flat relativistic line without crossing it. Decentralizing our anthropomorphic and selfish pursuits, recognizing that what matters is non-trivially (and even largely) outside ourselves, and loving the other as ourselves, with an openness to the ancient monadology, is precisely what we must realize and act upon.

<<footnotes "b" "But, I am obligated to remain open to the possibility of loving non-sapient objects (aside from what may be [[The Good]] [[Itself]]), even if only for Saint Hegel's sake, both from a dialectical OOO-like perspective and qua The Absolute (whatever it means to say it).">>
