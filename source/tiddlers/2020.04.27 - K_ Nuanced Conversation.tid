[10:44 AM] Ardent_Assailant: Hey. What’s the plan for today? Did family time go well yesterday?
[11:51 AM] h0p3: Besides school, nothing definite. Family Time went. We started and ended late.
[11:52 AM] h0p3: How was the past week?
[11:56 AM] Ardent_Assailant: It was a pretty good week. Had a bad case of insomnia last night though. Probably the worst I’ve ever had. Hoping tonight is better. Lol.
[11:56 AM] Ardent_Assailant: Gonna keep pushing through my grad school essays today too.
[12:08 PM] h0p3: Sorry about the insomnia. Hard to concentrate without sleep.
[12:09 PM] h0p3: I hope it won't be a lifelong thing for ya. Mine has never disappeared. There is usually going to be a night a month I don't really sleep; I'm lucky enough to be able to afford to have a blurry next day.
[12:09 PM] h0p3: What schools are you applying to?
[12:10 PM] h0p3: I don't know much about the grad school essay process for your domain, nor how competitive it is, etc.
[12:10 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Hearing that it isn’t really uncommon helps a lot actually. This is for my teaching application. :slight_smile:
[12:10 PM] Ardent_Assailant: I found out Friday that they are waving the praxis for now
[12:10 PM] h0p3: Sweet.
[12:11 PM] h0p3: Might be something they require later on, by X semester or something.
[12:12 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Yeah. They will supposedly tell me more once the application is approved. Either way, we can save a few hundred dollars right now. Lol.
[12:12 PM] h0p3: Good. Everything alright on the finances front?
[12:16 PM] h0p3: For my masters, I wrote a couple generic letters with a few things that could be personalized. I spent more time on phd letter because I only had one program I could apply to. Tight, one-page, picking out specific professors I wanted to work with (and regarding what), etc.
[12:16 PM] Ardent_Assailant: I wish I could do that instead. One of my essays is supposed to be about how cultural heritage influenced the way I learn.
[12:17 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Short answer, it kinda didn’t. Lol
[12:18 PM] h0p3: I am surprised by that claim.
[12:20 PM] h0p3: I probably have maximalist conceptions of "culture" and "heritage" here. Our conditioning environment just is a core of our cultural heritage to my eyes.
[12:20 PM] Ardent_Assailant: They want to know how coming from a diverse background developed the way that I engage with a text. Despite being told we were Native American, I grew up in a white household and attended a southern baptist school for seven years.
[12:21 PM] Ardent_Assailant: That’s an interesting way to look at it though. I already wrote a rough draft of that essay where I basically said being out of touch with my own heritage gave me a natural curiosity to learn more about it and others.
[12:23 PM] h0p3: Are you competing for scholarships here?
[12:25 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Nah. It’s just for admittance. :slight_smile:
[12:25 PM] Ardent_Assailant: I’m not putting too much stock into it tbh. The university is hemorrhaging money and they’re really worried about students not attending. I think they’ll admit me even if I turn in blank essays lol.
[12:26 PM] h0p3: Cool. Good. Not a problem then.
[12:26 PM] h0p3: (sorry, I'm in analysis mode, lol)
[12:27 PM] Ardent_Assailant: All good. :joy: I hate half assing it, but I’m just unconvinced that’s whoever is going to read it will truly care.
[12:27 PM] Ardent_Assailant: “Did they turn it in? Yes? Okay that’s good.”
[12:32 PM] h0p3: Yeah. I take it that it's a test of basic literacy (a non-trivial portion of applicants lack it even though they have a college degree) and a parallelizable test of empathy with your future students (which I think you obviously appreciate). Might be rubberstamped. I don't know how large the program is. I can say that at least some people who looked at my application remembered my application. Your professors may be crucial to getting a position you like (they might not).
[12:32 PM] h0p3: You have any fun this week? We barely talked this past week.
[12:35 PM] Ardent_Assailant: It was a pretty lax week tbh. Motivation has been hard to find and my health issues are putting my anxiety through the roof. I had a video visit with the urologist Friday morning which ended up being a prolonged two minute conversation summarized under “It’s all in your head.”
[12:36 PM] Ardent_Assailant: I’ve got some relationships with friends that I’m reevaluating as well and I know that’s stressing [[L]] out which sucks.
[12:36 PM] Ardent_Assailant: I’ve been thinking a lot about how to confront that specific issue but I keep coming up short.
[12:38 PM] h0p3: "All in your head" :smile: dick joke, lol
[12:38 PM] h0p3: Sorry, that is disappointing.
[12:39 PM] h0p3: Video visits might be underwhelming. I assume being in person provides additional vulnerability and expectation.
[12:40 PM] h0p3: I'm sorry you have to reevaluate friendships. That is an expensive thing to do.
[12:41 PM] h0p3: I'm glad it was lax because, from the sounds of it, your week kinda sucked in some ways, =/.
[12:41 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Truly it was one of my better weeks but yeah. I guess it did suck lol.
[12:43 PM] Ardent_Assailant: We have three specific friends who are incapable of having nuanced conversation with two opposing sides because any stance that goes against them becomes a personal attack no matter how gently said point is made. It’s getting to the point where I’m ganged up on because they aren’t intelligent enough to have an objective view.
[12:43 PM] Ardent_Assailant: It’s frustrating because they’re great people but part of me just thinks they’re dumb.
[12:43 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Or maybe I’m just an asshole. /shrug
[12:44 PM] h0p3: lmao, naw, you aren't an asshole
[12:45 PM] Ardent_Assailant: But I am. :joy:
[12:45 PM] h0p3: I am an elite asshole in many contexts, and I don't see it in you. You are kind, and I think you aim to be exceptionally diplomatic.
[12:46 PM] h0p3: One day, I will have the opportunity to see you slit throats, lol.
[12:46 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Lmao
[12:47 PM] h0p3: I doubt mere ignorance is the problem for you; malicious ignorance, though, I can see that being a problem.
[12:48 PM] Ardent_Assailant: I like to think most of my views are shades of grey now. I also think nothing should be immune to criticism. These folk, despite masquerading as accepting and understanding do not echo those ideas in the way that they live.
[12:48 PM] Ardent_Assailant: It’s more contrarian ignorance if I had to put a label on it.
[12:49 PM] Ardent_Assailant: I’m not afraid to take a contrarian stance as long as I have evidence to back up my belief, but these folk will actively move against something when they don’t agree with it with no good reason.
[12:52 PM] h0p3: That sounds maliciously biased to me. I think of our identities as non-trivially a web of beliefs and desires (some we choose, and some we don't). Reason must have emotional components to it, but they have to be configured and used correctly. They sound dishonest to me in dialectics. Their goal isn't the truth, wisdom, or fairness. It's selfish.
[12:53 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Driving. I’ll answer when I can :slight_smile:
[1:09 PM] Ardent_Assailant: It is selfish. And delusional. On what planet is it antagonistic to gain a more understanding view of the world?
[1:09 PM] Ardent_Assailant: But it also sucks because I used to consider these folk very good friends. And [[L]] still does.
[1:16 PM] h0p3: Sounds like a tough spot to be in. I assume that you rocking the boat, being honest, saying what ought to be said, holding your friends accountable (which just is being a good friend), and possibly even letting go of the relationship (which can be necessary) costs [[L]] something big here.
[1:16 PM] h0p3: It's a triangular problem.
[1:19 PM] h0p3: I still maintain relationships with people my wife hates (and, in fact, I don't like these people, but I love them), and vice versa. We're lucky to have each other's perspectives on non-shared friends too. But, even though I maintain these relationships, I think it makes sense for me to not ask her to sacrifice much energy or freetime about or with these people.
[1:22 PM] h0p3: As I get older, I think it's harder to find relationships that both spouses enjoy cultivating.
[1:23 PM] h0p3: The Dunbar Number becomes crowded, and you have to pick and choose which relationships matter the most.
[1:26 PM] h0p3: Deep relationships are a heavy investment of our lives (usually joyful, and sometimes sacrificial). Individually, it makes sense to have networks of shallow relationships, but together as a unit, I aim for my wife and I to bond deeply with roughly the same people. That is probably not the norm though, and I don't know how to do this well enough at all. I'm thinking out loud because I know this is a hard problem.
[2:06 PM] Ardent_Assailant: I do rock the boat, but only when I feel strongly about doing so. Despite the craziness of 2020 so far, my resolution to be more honest with people is still something I'm investing a lot into. Even when the truth hurts, I would hope that my own friends would give me the truth as well.

Random tangent, but I appreciate the openness of the relationship we share. I feel like I can tell you anything without fear of judgement, and you also challenge me to dig deeper into pretty much everything we talk about. I cherish that.

That being said, I find it even more infuriating with these friends specifically that they would rather be content to stay the way they are now than to grow and evolve as people. [[L]] recognizes this too, but she also feels that it's just something they may never overcome. To that extent, she is probably right. Despite she and I butting heads over this issue, I appreciate that she recognizes that it is a problem, even though she would rather forgive and move on than confront the issue. These are almost her own words so I think it's okay to put them in her mouth lol.
[2:07 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Yeah, at the end of the day, I want more than just surface level friendship. I want the tough conversations and the struggles. I want everyone to grow and become stronger people.
[2:08 PM] Ardent_Assailant: I realize that might sound like I'm trying to fix them, but that isn't the case. Just challenging them on beliefs when I feel something doesn't add up.
[3:04 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Random, but I bought 10mg of melatonin at the store today. Do you have any experience with it?
[3:07 PM] h0p3: Sorry, went down a small rabbithole.
[3:07 PM] Ardent_Assailant: all good!
[3:08 PM] h0p3: I have tried melatonin several times. It does something, but I'm not convinced it helps me sleep better (or fall asleep faster, etc.). I feel weaker (and relaxed) when I wake up though.
[3:08 PM] h0p3: The rest of my family have been using for a couple weeks now, and they say it helps (they seem to forget sometimes). I don't know if it is placebo for them.
[3:09 PM] Ardent_Assailant: do you know how much they take? Most places I see say that 10mg is excessive but not dangerous
[3:09 PM] h0p3: Getting the bottle now
[3:10 PM] Ardent_Assailant: bless
[3:10 PM] h0p3: [[k0sh3k]] is taking 5mg, and the offspring 2.5mg.
[3:11 PM] Ardent_Assailant: I'll cut it in half and see how it works. Even if it does nothing, placebo is indeed strong. :slight_smile:
[3:11 PM] h0p3: Placebo-generated good sleep is good sleep, lol
[3:15 PM] h0p3: Also, I'm grateful that we get to be so open too. Our friendship is a rare treasure for me. I cherish it too. I like that we can say literally anything, gross, silly, extremely serious, painful, and everything in between.
[3:16 PM] h0p3: It's obvious to me that you are building community. You do it in your family life, in your pleasures, and in your vocation.
[3:16 PM] h0p3: One of my rules for interpreting and evaluating people boils down to: would I want to see more of this person in the world? I wish there millions more of you in the world. It would be a better place.
[3:19 PM] h0p3: I often see your anxiety as a wrestling not just with yourself, but the world. You do it well. Not everyone who had to grow up as fast as you did fills in the missing gaps with the integrity that you do.
[3:19 PM] Ardent_Assailant: Lol. One of me is plenty. :joy:
[3:19 PM] Ardent_Assailant: I really appreciate that though. That's very kind of you to say.
