* Stunning!
** https://www.reddit.com/user/thegentlemetre/
*** If true, while GPT-3 isn't even the golem, even this leviathan could drown the world before the defensive arms race on most platforms could survive (and, if I were wealthy and evil enough, that's exactly how I would cash out: cheaply forum sliding my competition). I suggest this argument will be used to "justify" the centralized control of most ML in the hands of capitalists still.

**** Will I be running some ML tool off my GPU in FF to highlight the likely MLed text in the way that I highlight zero-width characters? I hope. We'll see.

* Think About It

*** You'd agree that blackbox detection of even correlation might actually be effective enough that it will be used, right? Even if it was only a small part of the total weight of the score, it could do some real damage.
** https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/online-content-policy-modernization-act-unconstitutional-mess
*** I know a lot of conservatives who are nearly powerless.  
*** Moderation that isn't decentrally user-controlled is fundamentally flawed. 
*** The fine is insane. Which platforms benefit from this piece of legislation?

* Fishy
** https://aeon.co/essays/racism-is-baked-into-the-structure-of-dialectical-philosophy
*** `/facepalm`. I've met my fair share of philosophers, and folks are generally quick to point these flaws out. Basic charity would go a long way here. 
** https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj479d/irs-investigation-location-data-no-warrant-venntel
*** I, of course, despise this bullshit. I also think the IRS is under attack on all fronts. This is targeting.

*** I have a hard time seeing this happening well enough. I'm going to take it to just be talk. So, then, I don't know what is really being pursued here.
