I love you too!

> You're my Root User; feel free to call anytime unannounced or otherwise, if that would be preferred. 

Hey, I've been doing a lot more VC recently (to the chagrin of [[my hubby|The Abyssal]]), maybe we could slide a sesh in somewhere.

> I agree that Impassionata is fascinating, especially during these times. I've almost read their complete PSM (they've been more active than usual lately, I suggest); it's gonna take a while to piece my argument together for them given the sheer number of contradictions (I do not predict they will have much interest, but we'll see).

Who knows how their life is going. I know my activity waxes and wanes and not always due to my mood (it's the same on plebbit as well; I can go from not posting for weeks to posting multiple times a day; though I'll always be a comments-only (just as I was replies-only on 4chan, never or rarely making threads)). I'm really enjoying the Book of Impassionata, either way. Some great stuff in there.

> I've been watching your work like a hawk too, ofc (I still aim to be your most loyal reader...I think your wiki updates comprise 98% of my web-based notifications these days).

As much as that? Wow! Hopefully those updates can be worth it :)

> Some of your arguments have reminded me of Saint Aristotle's concerns with teleology. Those are some mighty maxims to live up to. Many religious texts have no digital copies, and if there are any you need a scan of, let me know (I'll see what mi amor can do).

I looked into teleology a little; not sure I really understood it (those words like epistemology, ontology, etc. can do a number on my brain) but I think it's to do with things having inherent ends (as in purposes) in some sense? It's an interesting thought. The closest I came to understanding it was when the article (I think it was Wikipedia) said that evolution can be explained using it.

I've not needed a scan for a while - most stuff I have a copy of already - but thanks for the offer, I'll keep it in mind `^^`

> My /b/ is increasingly gibberish each day (plenty of the Recent work inspired by Impassionata in particular), and, no, you aren't stupid, lol (far from it, madame), :P.

Hey, gibberish may be gibberish, but a little poke in the right direction always helps. I think about a lot of it very carefully (in the event that I understand it!).

> We're hanging in there; the adults are stressed and worn, but the young humans seem to be doing just fine. How about you?

It's ticking over. I'm doing decently well at work. Working on beating procrastination as much as anything (an eternal issue for me) and hoping to take a week off WB the 28th. Glad to hear the young'uns are doing well and yeah this is a stressful time (I don't post geopolitics #Takes here because I'm positive that I'm incredibly uninformed, but I am watching the war in Ukraine; terrible situation all round).

Take it easy - hope to hear from you soon.
