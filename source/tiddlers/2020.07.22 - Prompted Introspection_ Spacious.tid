title: 2020.07.22 - Prompted Introspection: Spacious

!! Tell about your home.

I wish I had been answering this question all along in life. I'm left with figments or fragments, and I don't know which. [[2019.08.02 - Prompted Introspection: Living Room]] is cute, optimistic, and within range of being [[grateful]].

We live in a 1600ish sqft apartment (it's more than we need), hardfloors (I'm glad), it has a circle on the primary floor that we walk. We even have a dining room with chairs and tables. There's room for us to spread out now. I really live in my living room. I spend ~19 hours a day in it; [[monster-16]] and I sit in the corner of the living room, and my wife's office has been on the dining table for the past several months. My offspring have their own rooms now, and that seems to be something my daughter especially appreciates. I'm grateful that we have room for everyone to be in the same room in multiple rooms. It's a home that has more designatable workspaces. We have a little patio with a chair on it, plants (bushes in pots), and a dead [[Zeᶜʳᵉᵗ Garden]]. We have a catdoor. 

Someone, somewhere in my home is on a device right now. By the time I'm falling asleep (which I do with my device on, quietly speaking to me, usually //Archer// S06E05), my wife is waking up to listen to NPR or some other garbage podcast, :P. My offspring follow, and folks jump into the day. We take pomo breaks to stretch (though my son wants to cloak himself in his blanket and play on his phone while laying on the stairs) and walk that shit off in diffuse mode. The dining room tables often have laptops and cups and books and papers and cats and beads. When I am awake, there is music. Our lives are concentrated together, and we try to concentrate on what matters.
