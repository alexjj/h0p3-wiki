title: 2022.03.09 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: The Ketamine Hammer

Woke at 1. Hummus, rice, olives, water, and dark chocolate. [[TTTOTW]]. [[Variety Creepy]] pops in again. [[TTTOTW]]. //Koyaanisqatsi// per [[Impassionata]]'s suggestion as I work to finish off my archive of his posts (lots of digesting). The <<tag "Collage">>needs more shape. Then, //Wax or the Discovery of Television Among the Bees//, way beyond my paygrade. A schizo morning.

She's up. Decent mood. =). I'm a simple man. 

[[TTTOTW]]. 

//Skintime// with my sympaticon while watching //Wax or the Discovery of Television Among the Bees//. Couldn't stay awake any longer. Sleep by 7:45?

Woke at noon. Pinged [[Variety Creepy]] back. Seems like there's next to no willingness to speak asynchronously or dive any deeper, and the [[wrestling]] lines grow ever clearer. I shall take my signs and continue to be his sounding board. I've done my best with him, and the bridge remains.

//Skintime// and dialectics with my sympaticon. 

It's snowing. She promises to be safe. Planned a toilet-date. Finished up some tax identification paperwork for the state. [[TTTOTW]]. 

We're hitting what may be emergency territory. Doing the best we can with what we have. Tripsitting for my sympaticon. My DCK supply is old and less potent. 70mg. Have her in the bed behind me with all the soft things and her kitty plush. My son came down to grind, and we [[shared]] dark chocolate. Assignments and arguments with my daughter who does not value her time (or mine). [[DCK|DCK Meditation Log]] started to hit some, so I turned off the appliances and turned on the classical music. [[TTTOTW]].

My sympaticon is such a profound sensory beast. I'm doing my best to limit my questions (and, as usual, I have many to ask, especially of [[ASK]]) and be a good tripsitter. She's all giggles, purrs, wimpers, and begging to run around.<<ref "t">> Not convinced she's gonna K-hole on it, but it does something. It's definitely new. Her anthems soar, and she really wants to dance. It's not safe. I find the ketamine experience to be damn hard, but she's clearly having a great time. [[Good]].

Daughter got over the hump and decided it was worth talking to me with [[civil]]ity. She's experimenting and measuring commissions. She's easily burnt out, in her view, and this will help her evaluate and plan. `/thumbs-up`. Often no fun making [[art]] that you don't find [[salient]] except, in large part, because your audience does. She's admittedly jelly of my endurance and persistence; it's a goal for her.

Son thanked me for the new timer I bought him, can't find, so gave another. Pomos seem to be helping him, and I'm glad he's taking it seriously.

[[TTTOTW]]. [[ASK]] and I [[hope]] to work on a survival library. Checking out [[ASmith]]'s as well.

I'm not convinced DCK has helped, but I am glad we tried. Dialectics. She was convincingly over the trip, numbness subsided, lucid speech, no dizzyness. Timing was reasonable. Went to her own bed.

[[TTTOTW]].

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. She laughed her ass off at me for 20 minutes straight for gettin' completely rolled by my daughter. She says she wish she found it first. XD. I am a retard. Literally. 

Found my sympaticon huddled around Fernando the Fern. She was delirious, clearly on the edge of the k-hole. Fuck. Every person's timing is  different, and I should know better. Eventually got her to the couch. Traded dinner and dishes with my offspring. //Skintime// with my sympaticon. About an hour later, she started puking. Two shots of rum or 70mg of Deschloroketamine will do it, folks. Held her hair and comforted her, trying to do what you do after each puke cycle, eventually went downstairs again and started rotating our pots. We listened to music vidyas while mi amor was speaking with [[CH]].<<ref "s">>

She was good enough for [[Family Gathering]]. Held her, and we had tendies + salad. //House// tries to quit opioids the first time episode. 

More puking (dry heaving the entire time, as she's consumed only sparse amounts of water the entire time). Put her to couch. [[k0sh3k]] has been lookin' out for her too, brought [[ASK]] special ginger beer and ginger root pills.  

Kitchen.<<ref "k">> Put mi amor to bed.

[[TTTOTW]]. 

A wild [[Lutzi]] appears...

Made tea with my sympaticon. Seemed alright. More puking. Put her to couch. [[TTTOTW]]. This is well past the normal duration. I'm glad she didn't eat anything before we decided to go for it. Trying to get fluids in her. It was clearly an experience.
