title: 2021.10.01 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Whelmed, Neither Over Nor Under, A Calmer Sea of Feelings and Emoceans

Sleep by midnight? Woke at 5? Jittery. I need 2 more hours, at least. Nope. Meditation. She's up! I think she's feeling better this morning. We had bagels, coffee, and held hands while Meow begged and nuzzled. She's wearing a classic grunge flannel shirt, her vest, and a brown, velvety gypsy skirt. Offspring are being encouraged to try tea or coffee at this point (think my daughter made tea this morning, from the sounds of it). 

[[ASK]]ing. Sent her to bed. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]] + LCK Finals + Vapelyfe. Ranga wanted a lot of pets and crack. [[TTTOTW]].

//The Walk// with my offspring was poggers.<<ref "i">> Everyone enjoyed it. I didn't say much, and my daughter is tolerantly* annoyed when I don't respond, particularly when I'm lost in my world. They talked 90% of the walk, and I sat back. He had been reading about the Panama Canal. She did most of her schoolwork, and she has plenty to say about the differences and oddities of the German language (plenty of talking points with her mother on this one too). I don't remember enough. =/. They had a discussion of how animation smears sometimes look like the fear-inducing images of angels. 

My offspring found, formatted, and reworded 563 prompts for [[Prompted Introspection: Library of Prompts]]. My daughter prefers to regex replace, but everyone had fun with multi-cursor and macros. [[JRE]] called my son on Signal, and we all listened to their conversation. I like that my son says things that makes my brother laugh. There's a naturalness<<ref "n">> to the rhythm, content, and connection they've developed. Their quirks overlap, and they care about each others' stories. They're friends! I am sure to fail as an uncle by comparison. XOXOs and fuzzy tiddybean rubs with [[5c0ut]]. [[k0sh3k]] called me on the way back, with strings of accidents otw. 

Shopping @ W-Entity with mi amor. Friday night party supplies, 20 bathtowels (may we never run out). I was extra nervous (but decent), feeling the pain of her file losses. Sat in the car for a while. [[k0sh3k]] has a lot on her mind, and, primarily, it's about the fact that her mans pulls down his pants and underwear down to his ankles to whizz (I still play swords at 36), especially in public restrooms.<<ref "s">> She's way into it.

Cooked up some food. She did my nails. //Raw Skintime// (OMGourd, skinhungry) while watching //Making The Cut//. It's beyond a farce. My stomach is actually sick at re-interpreting Tim Gunn. =(. I should know better by now. Cynicism is painful. She did not want to fall on the sword (oof). She was going to study, but didn't want to disturb my sleep. Fine. Beat it, toots. Sleep by 8?
