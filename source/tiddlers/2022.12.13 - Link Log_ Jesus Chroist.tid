*** XD. Unfortunately, I've found this tooling does not work well. I realize I often sound like a bot (it flags tons of my writing, `/rawr`), which is fine. But, plenty of the latest GPT-3 goes unnoticed. I really want a working version of this tool that's local. Eventually, if I'm [[lucky]] I'm going to have to cough up for expensive GPUs to run it locally. `/fingers-crossed`. I'll probably need more than one.
**** This is a background tool I want running on every page I visit and in every conversation I have. Even with this type of tooling, the bulk of humans won't be able to tell is already quite a danger.
***** Even if there were a human middleman to the interface (set aside the box problem, its own terror), you're looking at an army that can simply out-produce copy all day erryday, especially with minimal training. Who is really going to regulate the transnational hyperscalers behind closed doors?

*** oof, so brutal, walk all over you; I think this is one of the reasons that [[good]] people need to be on guard, quicker to retaliate in [[Gradual]]ized [[T42T]], and prepared to jettison the garbage as politely as possible
