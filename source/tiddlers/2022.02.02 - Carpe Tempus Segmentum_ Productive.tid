title: 2022.02.02 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Productive

Woke at 2:30. Meditation. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Made some quesadillas, pears, water. Hugs'n'bugs with [[ASK]], and back to the couch with her. ~~Master~~ Mister [[1uxb0x]] was still far too loud on VC at 3am playin' [[vidya]] [[game]]s. Didn't have to say anything more than "I [[love]] you." He knew all of what I thought on the matter.

+0/-0/+0 Dredge vs Affinity. I barely took it down. [[TTTOTW]]. Chats with [[anon]]s. Assignments.

Wraps with [[ASK]] and picked up that special sugar snack for mi amor. I'm feeling warmer today. I do not know why. Seems good to me though.

Shopping @ Costco with [[ASK]]. We picked up a complete cart. We need more soap (they didn't have what we needed) and rosemary. Grabbed the hotdog and fizzy water combo too. 

Shopping @ Aldi with [[ASK]]. We got another full cart. We're efficient, and we have fun. I adore shopping with her.

Pre-emptive cleaning of the pipes. Trying Bio-Clean. I am convinced a powder is the only thing that will stick.

Dadnap, and not nearly enough. She came to join me, then drug me upstairs. //Raw Skintime// as she walked me through more old people losing their health. It's like a pandemic over here. Boss asked her to go for the DMin (similar to a PhD). `/nod`. Some epic shittalk. //Inform the Men!// Tight. Meditation. Shower of the gods!

Sore throat, ish, and headache (hrm...). Hoping it's just the dry air from the heat (which gets me often) and a lack of sleep. I'm sneezing too, so that's a preferred sign. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

[[Family Gathering]] was sick. [[ASK]] made pan-roasted chicken with veggies. It was insane. We watched The Bezoar episode of //House//.

Nearly asleep, [[JRE]] called me up. He's on the job, getting some food. Talking about the harsh realities of being a dad. He's been reading some narc survivor stories. Surprising number of "can't remember if I told you this or not"'s. [[Bn]] has more medical work on his ear coming up over the week. Says my curl-up is depression. I've done my best not to direct my anger inward while remaining back-breakingly polite. I am a hiki. I'm likin' it. `/shrug`. Have you gotten a load of the many, Socrates? Lawd. (Still fighting for democracy, ofc). He's got a gaming laptop for the worktruck now, gonna have to run some new wires. Takes a lot of energy speaking with the pig. Pig gave a standard argument against [[game]] addiction, that it detracts from our purpose, and my brother's response was, ofc, that he doesn't believe we really have a purpose (and then felt unhappy with his response, `/nod`).

Sleep by 9?
