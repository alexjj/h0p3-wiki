>> Is this a joke or for real, dude?

> Yes, sir. As a hypersexual creature, even as I walk through the store, I'm actively undressing females and fucking them in my imagination on the spot. Half a second to glance at their assets and I'm already watching them work their hypothetical magic.

Do people ACTUALLY fantasize about 'fucking' a 'hot' person they literally just saw on the street?

Holy crap, dude. What the hell is that? You just saw them right now. Oh my gosh!

[00:25:09] [[esinpe]]: Hey
[00:25:16] [[h0p3]]: Yo
[00:25:21] [[h0p3]]: How [[itdo]]?
[00:26:24] [[esinpe]]: Hey
[00:26:47] [[esinpe]]: Okay, so, you know my aunt who robbed us all of that inheritances, right?
[00:27:02] [[h0p3]]: How's she doing?
[00:27:39] [[esinpe]]: Well, she's doing fine. She called my dad up yesterday and asked him if she could visit our house today.
[00:28:10] [[h0p3]]: What'd he say?
[00:28:32] [[esinpe]]: She's coming to invite him for a house-warming ceremony. She's got like 10 houses. Never been invited for any of them before.
[00:29:04] [[esinpe]]: He said, "yeah come tomorrow at 8pm because that's when I'll be at home". 
[00:29:33] [[h0p3]]: `/nod`
[00:29:46] [[h0p3]]: I can imagine it's a complex feeling for you all.
[00:29:46] [[esinpe]]: I'm not interested in seeing her face. Neither is my mum or my bro.
[00:29:50] [[esinpe]]: Yes.
[00:30:02] [[esinpe]]: I know she is his sister, but holy shit dude.
[00:30:22] [[esinpe]]: He's all like, "The ball is in my court now"
[00:30:28] [[h0p3]]: To do what?
[00:30:34] [[esinpe]]: I really don't know what is going on in his head.
[00:30:44] [[h0p3]]: Hrm.
[00:31:31] [[esinpe]]: [10:00:28] [[h0p3]]: To do what?

To an egotistical and proud maniac that my dad is, the fact that she is the one who is giving up her pride to come talk to him.
[00:32:38] [[h0p3]]: That can be a complex situation too.
[00:33:00] [[h0p3]]: It doesn't sound like she really deserves the time of day.
[00:33:25] [[h0p3]]: Perhaps it is mercy, grace, forgiveness, an attempt to reconstruct.
[00:33:29] [[esinpe]]: My grandpa died 3.5 years ago, and my dad was the only one from our family who went to his funeral. Apparently it was a huge mess because of an argument between my grandpa's younger brothers and my aunt upon where he should be buried.
[00:34:17] [[esinpe]]: Before covid, she had once told my dad through a middleman that she wanted to meet him.
[00:34:25] [[esinpe]]: The middleman was their cousin.
[00:34:48] [[esinpe]]: > [10:03:25] [[h0p3]]: Perhaps it is mercy, grace, forgiveness, an attempt to reconstruct.
Dad isn't the merciful person you expect.
[00:35:12] [[h0p3]]: I do not predict he is.
[00:35:47] [[h0p3]]: But, I also know dark-triads who are made rather than born tend to have the ability to choose to switch their empathy on and off at-will. It is only a [[hope]].
[00:36:32] [[esinpe]]: I seriously don't know what runs through his head. After all, he's a fucking hypocritical, bureaucrat and he shows that bureaucratic behaviour. His head is full of weird calculations and everything. 
[00:36:36] [[esinpe]]: I don
[00:36:46] [[esinpe]]: I don't know what is going on here.
[00:36:54] [[h0p3]]: May he be conflicted for fitting reasons.
[00:37:17] [[esinpe]]: Hmmm. Let's see how it turns out.
[00:37:23] [[esinpe]]: That bitch...
[00:37:35] [[h0p3]]: Is that how he tends to speak about her as well?
[00:37:40] [[esinpe]]: Nah.
[00:38:05] [[esinpe]]: Even when my grandpa was hospitalised, he talked to her whenever she talked to him.
[00:38:23] [[esinpe]]: They never speak in public spaces and only in times like this.
[00:38:42] [[esinpe]]: And she's the one who starts the conversation and my dad replies. 
[00:38:48] [[h0p3]]: May it be a time of healing.
[00:38:52] [[esinpe]]: They talk as if everything is totally normal
[00:39:07] [[esinpe]]: > [10:08:48] [[h0p3]]: May it be a time of healing.
It isn't.
[00:39:14] [[h0p3]]: `/nod`.
[00:39:31] [[esinpe]]: I just hope that my grandmother doesn't come with her.
[00:39:51] [[h0p3]]: Sounds like your dad is in [[Reply Mode]] with her. 
[00:40:50] [[esinpe]]: My aunt said that she will be here with her husband. Never mentioned about her. I just hope she doesn't come. If she comes, she will deliberately try to hug me or something like that. Drama queen. I don't want to be touched by that scum.
[00:41:53] [[esinpe]]: > Sounds like your dad is in [[Reply Mode]] with her. 
Probably. I never bothered to understand the dynamics of their relationships.
[00:43:33] [[h0p3]]: It may be wise to continue to study the people around you and their relationships with others, especially when it is painful, unsavory, disgusting, and so on.
[00:43:59] [[h0p3]]: You're all riled up. Even more reason to be analytical about it. 
[00:48:57] [[esinpe]]: Honestly, I consider that a waste of time. I don't give a shit about this. Am I getting any money? Nope. So, fuck it. I don't even want a relationship with these people.
[00:49:17] [[h0p3]]: Do you really mean exactly those words?
[00:49:35] [[esinpe]]: Yes.
[00:49:39] [[h0p3]]: `/nod`.
[00:52:23] [[esinpe]]: She asked if mum and mym brother are gonna be there.
[00:52:28] [[esinpe]]: But not me.
[00:52:57] [[h0p3]]: I'm going to say it again to you, sir. Every person is my teacher.
[00:53:25] [[h0p3]]: They don't have to intend to be, nor do they have to be effective, let alone good people. 
[00:53:32] [[h0p3]]: Study your enemy.
[00:53:44] [[h0p3]]: Know why they are wrong to the core.
[00:54:04] [[h0p3]]: It is a rare opportunity.
[00:54:18] [[esinpe]]: Okay
[00:55:48] [[esinpe]]: So, do you really fantasize about a random person on the street?
[00:55:56] [[h0p3]]: Constantly.
[00:56:02] [[esinpe]]: Damn
[00:56:47] [[esinpe]]: That really sounds messed up to me
[00:57:18] [[h0p3]]: `/nod`.
[00:57:24] [[h0p3]]: I can see that.
[01:00:22] [[h0p3]]: I appreciate the upvote. :P
[01:04:20] [[esinpe]]: You're welcome.
[01:04:29] [[esinpe]]: Does it bother you in any form?
[01:04:39] [[esinpe]]: Walking around like that must be hard!
[01:05:04] [[h0p3]]: Oh, I'm often too busy to engage in thinking about sex. 
[01:05:44] [[h0p3]]: It can be be //hard//, ofc. XD. 
[01:05:50] [[h0p3]]: Mostly a delight though.
[01:05:59] [[esinpe]]: A delight? Wow.
[01:06:40] [[h0p3]]: People are often the most interesting objects (though not mere objects) in the room, and sex is easy to imagine.
[01:07:07] [[h0p3]]: Having a serious, intimate conversation, now that seems much harder to imagine, in my experience.
[01:07:22] [[h0p3]]: Much higher requirements for that.
[01:07:28] [[esinpe]]: That is much more easier for me than sex.
[01:07:55] [[h0p3]]: Well, I'm not claiming sex is that easy, just imagining it rather.
[01:08:17] [[esinpe]]: I understand.
[01:09:01] [[esinpe]]: Sometimes it takes me a moment to realise that I live in a sex-crazed world.
[01:09:43] [[h0p3]]: It must be difficult to instinctively make some kinds of inferences for you.
[01:09:59] [[h0p3]]: (and, I say that as an autist who is mindblind except through hard work)
[01:10:37] [[esinpe]]: Well, most people don't talk about sex so openly. That makes things easy for me.
[01:11:15] [[esinpe]]: Even when I'm eavesdropping on other people's conversations, it's more like them talking about some random tv show, gossip, etc. but never about sex.
[01:11:28] [[h0p3]]: I hope you will find crowds that do. It's sometimes great to be with people who will cut loose and say how they feel and think in an unguarded fashion.
[01:11:46] [[esinpe]]: Yep, that is true.
[01:22:50] [[esinpe]]: https://www.reddit.com/r/greentext/comments/tdwahc/this_post_is_irradiated/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
[01:25:55] [[h0p3]]: Pretty sick grindset
[01:27:03] [[esinpe]]: Sleep for only 5 minutes? Work for like 2 hours? That's the dream!

[14:02:51] [[esinpe]]: Hi
[14:25:59] [[h0p3]]: Yo
[14:34:48] [[esinpe]]: SUp?!
[14:45:03] [[h0p3]]: How's your day been?
[14:45:38] [[esinpe]]: I wasn't there when she came
[14:45:47] [[h0p3]]: `/nod`
[14:45:54] [[esinpe]]: She came, with her husband and driver.
[14:46:10] [[h0p3]]: classy
[14:46:12] [[esinpe]]: Ate some snacks and sweets, drank coffee.
[14:46:31] [[h0p3]]: All the mere virtue signals, surely.
[14:46:53] [[esinpe]]: >[00:16:09] [[h0p3]]: classy

Nah, I've got drivers too. A lot more than her and not even paid by my dad.
[14:47:45] [[esinpe]]: >[00:16:31] [[h0p3]]: All the mere virtue signals, surely.

More like pure awkwardness. She just sat there, asked dad a few questions and told him a few things and left.
[14:47:54] [[esinpe]]: Was like some 20-25 minute visit.
[14:49:25] [[esinpe]]: In fact, my dad gave a job offer to the driver's son when he asked for it (Old driver. Knew him even when things were good back then).
[14:50:17] [[esinpe]]: There was like a 15 second silence between every question she asked.
[14:50:22] [[esinpe]]: Awkward as hell for her.
[14:50:33] [[esinpe]]: Dad was mentally prepared.
[14:52:49] [[esinpe]]: She probably came because many people had advised her to mend things before it was too late.
[14:54:02] [[h0p3]]: `/nod`.
[14:54:08] [[h0p3]]: Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
[14:54:27] [[esinpe]]: To hear what?
[14:54:44] [[h0p3]]: That it was awkward, unsuccessful, maybe unconstructive. 
[14:54:59] [[esinpe]]: Not at all.
[14:55:09] [[esinpe]]: That was the message my dad wanted to send.
[14:55:15] [[esinpe]]: It was successful.
[14:55:48] [[esinpe]]: I wouldn't be surprised if my younger aunt is the next person to visit.
[14:55:57] [[esinpe]]: And then my grandmother.
[14:56:10] [[esinpe]]: I don't know who will be the first in those two.
[14:57:29] [[h0p3]]: I'm surprised to hear there will be a line of people like that.
[15:03:23] [[esinpe]]: Let me tell you one thing, sir. These are the people with zero self-respect, and don't care about humiliation. These are the kind of people who would even jerk a dog off if they think it would help them in the future in any way.
[15:04:01] [[h0p3]]: Hrm. I don't have a problem with people jerking dogs off. It can be morally done.
[15:04:27] [[h0p3]]: I've met plenty of folks in vet school who had to jerk animals off for their futures.
[15:05:38] [[esinpe]]: Look, I know that people in the breeding business and vets do it, but for an ordinary person like us, nope!
[15:05:54] [[h0p3]]: Why is it a failure to respect one's dignity?
[15:06:33] [[esinpe]]: I respect the vets and the others.
[15:07:22] [[esinpe]]: My dad's sisters and mum don't have dignity.
[15:07:31] [[h0p3]]: What is dignity?
[15:07:39] [[h0p3]]: I am not convinced they lack it.
[15:07:49] [[h0p3]]: Or, at least not the sort that I'm concerned with.
[15:09:34] [[esinpe]]: Nobody respects them for how they buried my grandfather.
[15:09:58] [[h0p3]]: Why should we think that the kind of dignity that matters is in virtue of whether or not the people around them recognize and respect that dignity?
[15:10:34] [[h0p3]]: Can't someone be treated like a subhuman without deserving it? And, wouldn't that lack of desert be in virtue of dignity?
[15:11:42] [[esinpe]]: Look, I have never treated someone subhumanly.
[15:11:59] [[esinpe]]: Nor has anyone in my family.
[15:12:04] [[esinpe]]: Even to them
[15:12:04] [[h0p3]]: `/nod`.
[15:12:23] [[h0p3]]: That's not responding to my line of questioning.
[15:12:33] [[esinpe]]: I'm coming to that.
[15:13:51] [[esinpe]]: When I talk about dignity, I am talking about treating them the same way for who they are. You will surely treat your own brother better than a distant relative.
[15:14:29] [[h0p3]]: Sounds like evo-psych reasoning to me.
[15:14:54] [[esinpe]]: She received the treatment she would get if she was a nobody with an appointment to meet my dad, not as his beloved sister.
[15:15:27] [[h0p3]]: I work quite hard to make it so that even strangers in the desert receive the same treatment that my brothers do. Birth lottery is a morally arbitrary characteristic.
[15:15:57] [[h0p3]]: I understand your description, but I don't see a viable prescription here.
[15:16:15] [[esinpe]]: You do those things to your brothers out of love.
[15:16:22] [[h0p3]]: [[Love]], yes.
[15:16:22] [[esinpe]]: But you don't do that for a stranger.
[15:16:26] [[h0p3]]: Yes, I do.
[15:16:28] [[h0p3]]: I'm doing it right now, sir.
[15:16:38] [[esinpe]]: Out of love?
[15:16:41] [[h0p3]]: Yes.
[15:16:45] [[esinpe]]: Okay.
[15:17:38] [[esinpe]]: Well, I may treat a stranger better than my brother, but I would never do it out of love. How could I love and care for them? I have just met them.
[15:17:54] [[h0p3]]: There is where you must search for the concept of dignity.
[15:18:19] [[h0p3]]: I'd like to recommend Saint Kant to you. 
[15:19:01] [[esinpe]]: I treat the stranger well because that's what they deserve. They're a fellow human. But to me, my brother is a lot more.
[15:19:32] [[esinpe]]: We are, after all, of the same blood.
[15:19:52] [[h0p3]]: I do appreciate where you're coming from.
[15:20:18] [[h0p3]]: This is a hard place to think about. 
[15:20:35] [[esinpe]]: I don't think my aunts even deserve what a stranger deserves.
[15:20:40] [[h0p3]]: I see that.
[15:21:56] [[esinpe]]: And thus, they don't get to be treated with dignity others get.
[15:22:19] [[h0p3]]: Because you don't think they deserve it, they don't. 
[15:22:32] [[esinpe]]: From me, yes.
[15:22:37] [[h0p3]]: I see.
[15:22:58] [[h0p3]]: A mere social construction, a subjective evaluation alone.
[15:23:33] [[esinpe]]: Oh yeah? Why do you hate your parents so much?
[15:23:47] [[h0p3]]: A long story. A matter for the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱. 
[15:23:50] [[esinpe]]: Why don't you talk to them?
[15:23:53] [[h0p3]]: I do.
[15:23:57] [[h0p3]]: At great length.
[15:24:15] [[esinpe]]: Why don't you have the same relationship you had when you were younger?
[15:24:39] [[h0p3]]: Some components are the same, some are different.
[15:24:57] [[esinpe]]: But you still hate them.
[15:25:07] [[h0p3]]: I do, and yet, I work hard to love them.
[15:25:19] [[h0p3]]: As is quite clear in that letter.
[15:26:08] [[esinpe]]: Why? It's also a mere social construction you have created. Something quite subjective, only evaluated by you. They might be the best of the people I know.
[15:26:44] [[h0p3]]: Why should I think it's a mere social construction? Why do you think I'm assuming a subjective standard here?
[15:27:01] [[h0p3]]: I agree that subjectivity plays a necessary role, but it's hardly sufficient.
[15:27:43] [[h0p3]]: I do not agree to the claim that X deserves Y merely because I believe it.
[15:28:39] [[esinpe]]: [00:56:46] [[h0p3]]: Why should I think it's a mere social construction? Why do you think I'm assuming a subjective standard here?

You say that your dad is/was a pastor. He definitely has helped so many people find peace of mind with God, a thing which you believe to exist.
[15:29:08] [[h0p3]]: That is not my claim.
[15:29:10] [[esinpe]]: > [00:57:42] [[h0p3]]: I do not agree to the claim that X deserves Y merely because I believe it.
But that's what you're trying to say when it comes to my case.
[15:29:58] [[h0p3]]: That's what you said though.
[15:33:24] [[esinpe]]: > [00:59:57] [[h0p3]]: That's what you said though.
Yes. That's what I did. I did it purposefully, just to make you understand how it feels to be in my place when you did that. Things don't look all philosophical now, do they? What you know about my family is just the tip of the iceberg. It is the same with what I know about yours. It is not right for either of us to talk about them. It's best if we drop it here.
[15:34:02] [[h0p3]]: Oh. Okay.
[15:34:23] [[h0p3]]: How else was your day, sir?
[15:34:34] [[esinpe]]: I went to my mum's sister place.
[15:34:37] [[esinpe]]: It was nice.
[15:34:50] [[esinpe]]: I went there to avoid this.
[15:34:54] [[h0p3]]: I see.
[15:35:03] [[h0p3]]: Did you get to chill with any folks there?
[15:35:16] [[esinpe]]: She didn't mind me coming to her house unannounced.
[15:35:22] [[h0p3]]: A blessing, no doubt.
[15:35:31] [[esinpe]]: Nobody was here, other than her.
[15:35:47] [[esinpe]]: My uncle and my cousin were out to watch a movie.
[15:36:15] [[esinpe]]: She was all alone. I didn't mind it.
[15:37:26] [[esinpe]]: It's 1:07 am now. I'm now. I think it's time if I went to bed.
[15:37:29] [[esinpe]]: Goodnight!
[15:37:32] [[h0p3]]: Yes, sir. Sleep well!
[15:37:35] [[esinpe]]: And have a good day!
