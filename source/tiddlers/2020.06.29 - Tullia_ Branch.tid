oh, what is your philosophical branch? Analytical/continental/something else?

Tullia d'Aragona, [29.06.20 13:32]
branch seems like not very fitting word, but i guess thats understandable in a context

h0p3, [29.06.20 13:33]
Primarily analytic, but I have been lucky enough to study continental too.

Aw, and what was your field of study? If i may ask, im just very curious

h0p3, [29.06.20 13:41]
Primarily moral philosophy

I seek Straussianly heterodox interpretations of many philosophers. Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, Marx, Heidegger, GÃ¶del, Wittgenstein, Rawls, and Chomsky are my primary philosophers of interest. I'm profoundly opposed to Psychopaths, Humeans, Nietzschephiles, Egoists, Physicalists, Moral Anti-Realists, Constructivists, Coherentists, Truth Relativists, Libertarians, the online Bayesian-LW-empiricists who refer to themselves as "Rationalists," Reactionaries+Capitalists, and those who stand in the way of the decentralization of power in the right way, at the right time, for the right reasons. I'm interested in The Good, Dialectics, Computational Theory of Mind, Logic, Moral Realism, Neo-Rawlsian Marxism, Privacy, Cybernetics, and Game-theoretic Definitions of The Golden Rule.
