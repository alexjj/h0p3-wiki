You both like Philosophy.
You: Yo
Stranger: Heyo
You: It's my honor to meet you, nomad.
You: You a fan of philosophy?
Stranger: I am
You: Dope.
You: Me too
Stranger: Do you have a topic in mind? If not, I can suggest one
You: I have a topic, but it might not be what you want to speak about. I would much rather speak about what interests you.
You: In case: I'm thinking about trying to use Omegle more consistently. I don't have much practice with it. I'm interested in how GPT-3 might enable honeypots or trawling Omegle. Imagine continuously hunting for people who probabilistically respond to prompts in such a way that an operator can have many concurrent conversations without missing a beat.
Stranger: I want the topic to be of interest to both of us
You: I aim for broad definitions of philosophy. Hard word to define as it is.
Stranger: That was tough to understand
You: I apologize. I am not a great communicator.
Stranger: Because I don't know what a honeypot or trawling is
You: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)
Stranger: Well anyway, what you're looking for was possible before Covid
Stranger: The website has 13,000 people online at any given time
Stranger: Now it's too overflowed
You: Aye. That is a serious number of anons.
Stranger: So, good conversations were possible before
Stranger: You could find 3 of them in an hour
You: Wow.
You: That is a very high signal-to-noise ratio.
Stranger: Now the website is like the mind of a schizophrenic chimp
You: Does it feel like this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September ?
You: I see.
You: Schizophrenia is an interesting topic.
Stranger: I have a topic
Stranger: It's a very important one
You: Go for it
Stranger: Not many are made for this topic
Stranger: Third force.
You: Tell me about it.
You: I'm woefully ignorant about the matter.
Stranger: In reality, everything is made of 3 forces
You: I'm making a joke meme for a second, but I take your claim quite seriously: tri-force.
Stranger: The assertive force, the denying force, both of these are visible. It's someone saying "No" to someone offering something, or a mountain in the way of a road being built
Stranger: The third force, the mysterious one, is not visible
You: Are you a fan of Saint Hegel?
Stranger: I'm not
You: How about Saint Marx?
Stranger: No
Stranger: The third force however, flies completely under the radar for all of humanity
Stranger: They have no idea of it's existence
Stranger: This is why people argue for hours, never coming to an agreement
Stranger: And why disputes and conflicts happen over and over and over
Stranger: Between countries
You: Are you a fan of Saint Laozi?
Stranger: No
Stranger: I'm not
You: I am still listening. Forgive my terrible questions.
Stranger: Well that's it
Stranger: Third force
You: I am a linkwhore. Do you have any links that you consider especially valuable in this space?
You: Maybe a linkslut* lol
Stranger: Are you female?
You: I am not.
Stranger: Alright, anyway, what you can google is the Law of Three
Stranger: The 3 forces are diefied in religions
Stranger: It's the trinity
You: Yes, indeed.
Stranger: It's objectively a boring topic
You: Do you think this three-body problem has universal appeal to all cultures?
Stranger: Because people cannot see third force
Stranger: It's taken me a few years to understand what I've read about it
Stranger: It is not that is has appeal
You: Do you mean to say you cannot perceive anything of it at all?
You: Can you know properties of such an object-process?
You: Do you believe there is such a thing as a true contradiction?
Stranger: It's that the acknowledging of "third force" is the key to becoming a fully matured, loving adult
Stranger: So all wise men know of it
Stranger: And it makes it's way into religion and mythology
Stranger: Third force is transcendent of reality
Stranger: It involves creativity, which is irrational
You: Do you think it has a strong relationship with the concept of emergence?
Stranger: I don't know what concept that is
You: Do you consider it a Wiccan concept?
Stranger: It is most likely in Wicca
Stranger: But I don't of it being in it
Stranger: know*
You: What do you think of the concept of Karma?
Stranger: I believe it
You: Do you believe reality is ultimately a just one?
Stranger: I do not
You: I'm enjoying my conversation with you, btw. It is rare that I reveal anything about myself to people. This is me: https://philosopher.life/.
You: What do you mean by karma?
Stranger: You're asking me but you brought it up.
You: That's true. Would you like me to give a definition first?
Stranger: I generally don't answer questions that have no gusto behind them
You: Ah, what's a question that has gusto behind it?
Stranger: A question which comes from the still heart
You: I can't say I understand what a still heart is.
Stranger: The mind still
Stranger: The heart feeling
Stranger: A question coming from that
Stranger: As opposed to coming from memory
You: I am open to the claim that memory extends beyond the circuitry in my brain.
You: For example, I consider my computer to hold part of my memory.
You: My brain has pointers to places on my computer that house what I take to be my memory.
Stranger: Yes so
Stranger: That's why I don't answer questions from memory
You: Why is the heart feeling not a form of memory?
Stranger: It's like talking to a chatbot
You: Sometimes I am quite bothered by the idea of speaking to bots.
You: I've been speaking with GPT-2 and GPT-3 as though they are more than computers to get a feel for the possibility that they might some day become sapient (or future incarnations based on these tools or data sets).
Stranger: I'm sorry to tell you, but AI will never be sentient
You: It might never. I am unable to say either way.
Stranger: Well what's being suggested is that humans are simply complex computers, and since the growth of AI is considered to be exponential in nature, then what follows is that AI will match humanities abilities one day
Stranger: And therefore be conscious
Stranger: But humans are not complex computers
You: I agree there is a part of us that is more than merely a complex computer.
Stranger: The only part that is a computer is the body
You: We are at the very least complex computers, but I suggest far more than that.
Stranger: The mind nor feelings are computers
You: Will you agree that computation of our bodies is necessary even if insufficient for being Dasein?
Stranger: I don't know what Dasein is
You: The kind of subject that is aware of its own subjectivity. It thinks about its own existence, perhaps recursively.
You: Self-consciousness in the right way, at the right time, for the right reasons, especially.
Stranger: I don't know
You: Fair enough.
Stranger: I don't think so
Stranger: Because what being is
Stranger: The most pure being
Stranger: Will
Stranger: Will itself
Stranger: It is spontaneous
You: Infinitesimal and instantaneous?
Stranger: Robots, computers, are what Will made for world functionality
Stranger: So that worlds run on their own with not total interference from the source of them
Stranger: Like watches, they continue with very little help forever
You: Do you believe that Will can be subdivided into smaller wills?
Stranger: Why do you ask questions that are disconnected from eachother?
You: What is the "largest" Will? (If that is even a cogent question for you)
You: I don't think they are disconnected.
You: We have a language barrier. I'm doing the best I can with what I have.
Stranger: How old are you?
You: I am 35.
Stranger: Where are you from?
You: Chicago
Stranger: Are you male or female?
You: Male
Stranger: You're very head-centered
You: I agree.
Stranger: You should do something artistic, it will bring balance to your life
You: You should see the link I sent you.
Stranger: Try to become the best painter, composer, something in your city
You: It's my magnum opus.
You: I am a reasonably strong pianist too.
Stranger: Feel your solar plexus
You: Doing so now.
Stranger: It will active a hidden brain you have not used in your life, at least since when you were young

You: You can test a limited version of it here: http://aidungeon.io/
You: There is this institution called "OpenAI" that has made a pretty sweet chatbot in a way.
Stranger: that's interesting
You: It's kinda shocking what it accomplishes.
Stranger: to be honest AI stuff scares me
You: When I was your age, nothing like this machine learning existed.
You: It is scary.
You: I am extremely worried about how it will be used.
Stranger: yeah technology is always advancing
Stranger: me too
You: It does. And, I have to ask myself: to whose benefit?
Stranger: i think the intent is good it's just how it's used that can make things go terribly wrong
You: Ah, you are much kinder and more charitable than I am.
You: I appreciate your idealism.
Stranger: well isn't that with anything? or at least i'd hope
You: It is important to make sure you look for those who have good intent. Hold them close and dear.
Stranger: like we're trying to make the world better
You: I agree that some people, like you, do their best.
You: You have good intent. I agree.
You: But, after your frontal lobes have developed at 25, you'll find that people tend to slide further and further into a kind of selfishness and disregard for others.
You: That doesn't make it right.
You: It's just a description of a large subset of humans.
Stranger: i already know that but i choose to focus on the positives, my optimism is what keeps me alive
Stranger: being cynical seems like a waste of time
You: Pessimism in the right doses is exactly what will keep you alive in some cases too.
Stranger: maybe
Stranger: being realistic is the best
You: I agree that being cynical at the wrong times, in the wrong ways, for the wrong reasons is at the very least a waste of time and energy.
You: yes. agreed!
You: I hate to say it, but I think that depressive realism is an important consideration.
You: It takes a lot of careful reasoning to handle it.
Stranger: but it sort of makes it harder to improve and make changes
You: Well, it makes it easier to improve where it matters most, and to recognize where you actually can make a difference.
You: Stoicism is an important concept here.
Stranger: look at all the media and news sources for example, all they show is the depressing negative and horrible things going on in the world and not the actual small changes that are happening
You: Oh, I agree that many media outlets portray what will make them money or increase their power. Just because they present the world in this way doesn't make it so, of course.
You: But, just because they are wrong in how they represent the world in many respects doesn't mean that the world is doing great.
You: I agree that you need a balance.
You: Having dances, biking on trails
You: good sleep
You: I think that's super important.
Stranger: it is
You: I've been thinking about getting a bike, btw. Been a long time since I had one. Any recommendations? I'm kinda fat. I weigh over 200 pounds, lol.
You: I'd like a bike that is fairly inexpensive but durable.
Stranger: i have no clue
You: Well, worth asking. I don't know many cyclists.
You: I'll probably end up just buying whatever is cheap and appears to be reasonably rated.
You: So, what was the last book you read?
You: I'm reading a book called Watchmen. It's delightful.

You both like Philosophy.
You: Hey
You: Philosophy is an excellent topic. Would you like to talk about that?
Stranger: About it's broadness?
Stranger: Sure.
You: I am fine with that question.
Stranger: Something specific?
Stranger: Sure.
You: I hate to admit it, but I do not know how to define the word "philosophy."
You: I don't know what doesn't fall within the umbrella or space.
Stranger: Philo, from the greek work "φιλια" which means keenness, and sophy, from the from the greek word "σοφια", which means wisdom.
Stranger: Besides.
Stranger: It isn't something inherent in the nature.
You: I agree that it is the love of wisdom.
You: I like this quip: "Knowledge is knowing a tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad. Philosophy is wondering if that means ketchup is a smoothie."
Stranger: Much more like a human construct.
Stranger: Great analogy.
You: Hrm. I hate to admit that I cannot define nature well enough either.
You: It's a weasel word in some places.
Stranger: How about the tangible scope of things?
You: Do you believe that knowledge is a construction? Do you believe the thing-in-itself is a construction?
You: Tangibility for what? If it enters my phenomenology at all, does that count?
You: I would argue that reality and nature are the same thing, but I'm not a nominalist or a physicalist.
Stranger: Everything is really. Even the matter "brain", down to a molecular level {that's huge compared to the infinitesimal scale of things}, creates knowledge, but it's nothing more than "matter". The neural synapses, are a real thing.
You: I suppose it's a weird question, but do you believe that all things have minds or subjective perspectives?
Stranger: If you want to attribute this, to a philosophical lenses of viewing, so be it.
Stranger: Define minds. A start? Yes they surely do. Everything has a start. It just doesn't exist, without first being non existent.
You: I suggest a mind is a subject with qualia that experiences a computable medium.
Stranger: As for subjective perspectives? Some tangible things, are able to be in different momentums, thus superficially defined by me, has a rather cohesive perspective, rather than the object that was just created.
Stranger: Tangible value they say..
Stranger: You either attribute such, or don't. The rest are plain ambiguities.
Stranger: For instance i have a necklace.
Stranger: Why is it so important though?
Stranger: Or my first banknote.
You: That is a valuable question.
You: Are you a realist?
You: (or, we can disambiguate that)
Stranger: I do not embrace radical notions, ever, so somewhere in the middle, on par with idealism.
Stranger: Narrow mindedness helps nobody.
You: Ah, I see. I am interested in the middle way of idealism. That seems to be a hard problem.
You: I suggest that virtue is a uniquely deviant kind of bias and narrow-mindedness.
You: Including for picking out the golden mean on a virtue spectrum in any given context.
Stranger: Virtue, and it's reaction to it, is utterly subjective. But i really like the "golden mean" part.
Stranger: Golden mean refers to societal norms per se?
You: If we take subjectivity to be the only function for defining what is normative, I suggest it is particular to an individual or collective.
You: What are your thoughts on egoism?
Stranger: Masses, do certainly interfere in one's proclaimed free will. 
Egoism, I'd like to think, alleviates the fear of death, thus people embrace it.
You: Hrm. I'll agree that some egoists have mitigated the fear of death by embracing egoism.
You: Do you feel most people embrace egoism?
Stranger: It's more of an inevitable thing to embrace.
You: All subjectivities inevitably arrive at the conclusion of egoism?
Stranger: You cannot help it at times...
You: Perhaps. That seems fair to say.
Stranger: No. I think they arrive from the acknowledgement of the oneness of this existence, and it's attributed importance to one.
You: I am interested in this oneness, but I cannot say I understand it well enough.
You: Would that be the most important topic, in some sense, for a philosopher?
Stranger: Oneness = Existence = You and me talking right now
You: All that exists is a unity. The Real?
Stranger: Every philosopher {egoistically} chooses their most important topic, hence the different topics in philosophy.
Stranger: Well i can slap my face, so yes.
You: Would you accept this definition of philosophy: "the love of the wisdom of studying everything"?
You: Btw, I'm enjoying our conversation.
You: Thank you for speaking with me. If you ever want to reach out again, here's where you'll find me: https://philosopher.life/.
Stranger: Even if i agreed with that, our capacity does not allow so. From an age, a person starts to prioritize what's to love, and not. What's important, and what not. Kids, do love to study anything, thus making them the ideal philosophers, but from an age, a person starts to realize it's just counter efficient.
Stranger: Likewise friend, and I'm really appreciative of you, liking our conversation.
You: Aye. One must pick out what is salient from the heap, to reduce the world to the particulars that really stand out as being more valuable than all the others in one's context.
Stranger: You could say it like that too. One thing is certain. There isn't one explicit answer to anything.
You: Hrm.
You: Certainty is a very expensive thing to attain.
You: That seems like a very radical position to me.
Stranger: Maybe. without it human would be spaced out?
Stranger: *human{S}
You: I will agree that we require first principles from which and upon which to compute about the world wisely.
You: It is our plight to act from a sense of certainty in some contexts.
You: So, if you don't mind a personal question, how'd you end up becoming a philosopher?
Stranger: To add, pure anarchy is not the main initiator of what you know, and what you will know. It's just "placing your feet, in cold waters". People being bombarded with all sorts of notions, morals, values, anarchy's potent interference, is nothing but disputable. As always... Anarchy = Originality = Something superficial that you either care, or not care about.
You: Nature itself seems to be the origin on that view, right?
Stranger: Not a philosopher hahaha. I would like to pursue a post-degree someday though, in the foreseeable future.
You: Ah, I'm super broad in how I use the words philosopher and philosophy.
Stranger: The vicinity where, occurrences happening you say?
You: I think you are clearly doing philosophy.
You: I appreciate your humility for such a title.
You: I've had teachers refuse that title as well.
Stranger: The only philosopher i know, is my drunk uncle hahaha.
You: Haha. Dope.
You: I wish I had a drunk philosopher uncle.
You: You get to speak with your uncle often about philosophy?
Stranger: So drunk, unable to think, and reason correctly. That, in of itself, is a form of philosophy, I'd like to think. I never speak philosophy though no hhahaha. But each and everyone got their own story right?
You: I can say the selectively choosing not to think (or think about some particular) in some cases is the wisest thing to do.
You: It's shame you never get to speak philosophy. You have strong opinions and feelings about it.
You: Will it be difficult to continue your formal education in it?
Stranger: That was the initiator of my uncle, being a philosopher
You: Ah, that I agree to.
You: More than I know how I say.
Stranger: My own philosophy {if such thing exists}, is not to be strong about anything. There might've been things i said before, that sounded as if they were "absolute", but for the sake of the conversation they are nothing more than hypothetical yadayada. I never hold firm stance onto anything. Much rather, listen, analyze, and secretly assess, as if i've done otherwise so, i would've been the firm believer eheh.
Stranger: As for education? I tend not to care much, though i would like to pursue a degree in philosophy, and shortly after in psychology, as these two field link quite seamlessly here.
You: I have an {[[Axiom]]}: [[Question Everything]]. There, I agree, one must remain unstable, unfrozen, capable of bracketing and choosing a path for justification.
You: Those two fields go together very well.
You: Philosophy of Mind and Metaethics especially
Stranger: Question everything, without questioning everything.. Am i right?
You: I do not know well enough.
Stranger: No worries mate. Are you a philosopher yourself, may i ask. Like a holder of a diploma or something?
You: Aye. I do hold diplomas, and I've been paid to learn and teach philosophy. I consider myself a philosopher because I engage in philosophy (however poorly).
You: All that can also be found on the link I gave you.
You: It's a very special place to me.
Stranger: That initiation of yours, creating a "save haven", is nothing but peculiar. It's like a diary. A digital, and futureproof diary, Knowing all your thoughts, notions, and your model of reasoning is there, gives you a peace of mind.
Stranger: I do write a lot, and i feel that way exactly.
Stranger: There are some unfortunate cases, where one loses their mind completely.
You: No doubt. I steel myself against that worry.
You: I hope to be successfully resilient there too.
You: You should check out Tiddlywiki. It's an amazing tool.
Stranger: A knowledge base?
You: Many people use it for that, yes.
Stranger: There are certain applets, which are used explicitly for business, and there's a whole computer science field, which relates in to that.
You: It's a very flexible computing and writing tool.
Stranger: Myself, i use Joplin .
Stranger: Will definitely check, thanks for the recommendation.
You: Ah, I can see the appeal of Joplin.
Stranger: It's great yes.
You: TW is a quine (or at least quine-like), and you'll have the ability to shape the data and how you use it again and again. You build the interface inside it. It often helps me find what I'm looking for even when I don't know what I'm looking for.
You: It is cross-platform, and you own the process, data, and infrastructure.
Stranger: As in, self hosted?
You: It is, yes.
Stranger: Great. Definitely bookmarked.
You: Also a great use for these tools. I keep an enormous [[Link Log]]. Tens of thousands of bookmarks.
You: Eventually, I'll build out the tooling for archiving and grepping through them.
You: Hope to use it as a corpus for MLing a model of myself to speak with.
Stranger: I guess i could use that too, as the only organizational tool i possess and use at this instant, are folders, within folders, and so on, and so on...
Stranger: Speaking of bookmarks...
Stranger: Toolbar's folders..
You: Yes, those are super useful.
You: Are you asking how to emulate that functionality in TW?
Stranger: Not specifically, but i think sql databases are involved quite a lot.
Stranger: Sql in general.
Stranger: Javascript is powerful too.
You: If I were going to re-envision TW, it might be in virtue of something like SQL.
Stranger: Definitely so, as it is a wiki manager.
You: Javascript is very portable, and WASM isn't there yet. I am excited by it.
Stranger: Technology...
You: I'm a junkie, lol
Stranger: I smoke, whatever it is open sourced. I wish i would run linux, but i'm stuck on Windows, due to compatibilitY, and maintenance issues.
You: VM can work here.
You: I run Windows in VM, and passthrough is useful for gaming.
Stranger: Vm is pain in the ass, in an non virtualization based cpu lol.
You: Ah
You: It's infeasibly slow if your CPU isn't designed for it.
Stranger: Will update someday...
Stranger: YEah
You: Your machine must be ancient. Gotta be quite a hacker to survive on limited resources.
You: Well, you could also dual-boot.
You: Hit Windows only when you must.
Stranger: It's an oldie thinkpad from 2009. I5 200k, 8gb ram, A beast for daily tasks. I never game though, hence me not updating in all those years lol.
You: Hrm. I am surprised that it is not capable of VMing.
Stranger: I considered dual boot, but it has some profound performance issues still. When i install linix, i cannot help it but enable end to end encryption. That comes with it's caveats though.
You: I don't think encryption should be a problem for ya.
Stranger: It's 2nd gen based, so i think it can barely run windows 7.
Stranger: Lot's of over heating issues too.
You: One of my favorite processors was the i7-2600k.
You: Yeah, second gen could run a bit hot. It was a big step forward for Intel.
Stranger: Sandy bridges had definitely the "snappiness" embedded onto them
Stranger: Anything sandy related.
You: It's a shame to see the slow progress we've made in processors since then.
Stranger: 2009, was the pinnacle of progress for sure
You: haha
You: It was a special year, no doubt.
Stranger: 2009ish 10ish, hell yeah
You: So you use Joplin a lot. If you don't mind me asking, what sort of work do you do for a living?
Stranger: I'm a systems adminstrator, coupled with management (hardware-software)
You: Neat.
Stranger: Thanks.
You: Do you enjoy your job?
Stranger: On thing i like about being a system adminstrator, is that serenity is involved there big time. Just your typical maintenance schedule.. (Setting aside management). Though i definitely had other plans. Wanted to be a psychologist, but were too stupid for it. Still am, so I;m stuck here. No complaints though definitely a decent one.
You: What pieces of software do you hold in high regard? What pieces do you abhor?
Stranger: Languages you say? or work's daily requirements?
You: Yeah, okay, languages. What languages do you enjoy using with computers?
Stranger: I mostly use C, and javascript. As for the job, my responsibility is to direct the team efficiently.
Stranger: Creating plans, documentations, and so on.
You: Makes sense.
You: And, Joplin surely comes in handy there too.
Stranger: Nah, Joplin is just my preference.
Stranger: Anyways mate, it was nice talking to you. Very much appreciative of you talking with me. All the best.
Stranger: Farewell friend.
Stranger has disconnected.

You: `/wave`. Lawd, our disagreements (and/or your trolling or ignorance) run deep. IIRC, Q6600 in 2009 for me, no Sandy Bridge. Not worth the time correcting at this point. Farewell.
