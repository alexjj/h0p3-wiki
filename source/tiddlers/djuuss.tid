* djuuss is away.
[18:06:43][djuuss] thank you for your artful and generous collection of files 
[18:08:20][djuuss] i found you by looking for estas tonne and i got curious to find it in a folder called 'bootable usb' :D and any playlist that has him on it.. and it's splendid
[18:08:32][djuuss] thank you very much
* djuuss is available.
[19:15:37][h0p3] It's my pleasure. If you have any recommendations anywhere near as good as Estas Tonne, please let me know. I think that dude is magic.
[19:15:51][h0p3] More on my [[Music: Library]] here: https://philosopher.life/#Music%3A%20Library
[19:16:03][h0p3] (that's a single html file, but it packs a lot in it)
[19:20:33][h0p3] Looks like you already have our wikis queued up. `/salute`.

[6:05:34][djuuss] ohhh i love it
[6:05:47][djuuss] about the relationsihp between good and beautiful
[6:05:56][djuuss] terence said the same thing, and i found it too
[6:06:06][djuuss] you can't directly approach 'the good' because how would you know it? 
[6:06:27][djuuss] but, you can concern yourself with the beautiful. and trust that it will take you also towards the good
