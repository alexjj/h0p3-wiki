title: 2022.04.30 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: She's Feeling Off

Woke at 9:30? Had been ruminating, meditating, and dreaming for hours. [[TTTOTW]].

Woke the offspring. Assignments. Usual peptalk and review. Thinking through the history of their choices over the years here. `/nod`. Can tell my daughter is struggling with our newfound agreement to be tender. Sometimes saying nothing is the best one can do, ofc. I worked more on the door hardware. More paint stripper coatings.

[[ASK]] made a grits + corned beef hash + cheese sauce casserole (from leftovers) into a smashing dish. Folks chilled in the kitchen. [[5c0ut]] was told the stage interview was called off only hours before it was to occur. Bullet dodged, I suppose. He was feeling alright about it too, as I had been thinking about the matter with him this week. Glad we are doing the right way. We argued about the nature of casseroles, again. The two chefs led us on a journey as my daughter tried to poke holes. Vapelyfe. 
   
Mi amor is off today. Blue, nasty headache, anxious, feeling crowded, and something else is off too (can't put my finger on it). [[TTTOTW]].

Mi amor took us to The Library. There's a seedbank there. Neat. I looked lost, but just in my head really. It's what I do in public spaces. 

Shopping @ W-Entity with mi amor. Ended up not getting stuff to make cookies for her students. Grabbed some breakfast for her (which she had been skipping pretty consistently otherwise).

Assignments. 

//Skintime// with my sympaticon. We chilled at [[m16]]. [[TTTOTW]].

//The Date// with mi amor. We had Mexican food. I had enchiladas and one taco al pastor. Chips and dip too. It was dope. This cheered her up considerably.

Assignments. Failures to be honest. `/sigh`. Doing what we can.

[[D2]]. I had a death on NeckRomancer. Beyond the glory, ofc, I'm having a hard time caring about anything beyond 93 though. We're going to make it, and I think Aurora too. Found 3/10 gloves for javazon and 3/20 bow from vendor farming. Sugar was loaded with a new-made Harmony, Valkyrie helm, Cat's eye, Sander's, and every run/walk speed charm I have for it, since she's 75 (perfeck #). We need to take Jill through Baal to do Cow runs. I've got a reasonable amount of gear for her to run them quickly enough, and with the loot filters, it will be much easier on the eyes. Also, Key of Destruction looted. Only took 30 runs? I've got at least 20 of the other keys. This is the standard bottleneck. Gonna keep collecting them until we can't wait. We've engaged in time trials. 7 and a half minutes is our best run. We may eventually get that down to 3 with practice and top gear.

[[TTTOTW]]. Chilled with mi amor, and a bet about her bedtime. Put my sympaticon to sleep. [[TTTOTW]]. Hugs'n'bugs. Put mi amor to bed after said marker. =D. [[TTTOTW]]. Ranga came down for pets and crack. I had leftover roasted veggies. [[TTTOTW]]. //Altered Carbon// for bed.
