Merry Christmas and happy holidays, [[h0p3]]! Hope you and your family have had a restful time. :)
Merry Christmas, homie!
It's been a chill day.
I got penis and boob toys (not for these objects, but replica toys), like you'd get out the quarter vending machines.
You having a good one?
Lol. I bet those are super amusing. :)

Not terrible. We saw my folks yesterday and it was good for once. We got a hotel in etown and it was super swanky. Sleep sucked but we were comfortable at least. 

Today was more anxious because [[UJ]] was having a rough day, but the big Christmas went off well enough. I masked the whole time just to be safe. Now we are driving back home and I might make some alcohol when we get there. We did a big brunch btw. I forgot to mention that. [[AA]] made some very untraditional French toast that was mouth watering good.
Sounds like it was mostly a solid party.
Not too many allergies either, hopefully.
You'll have to tell me about how student teaching went this past semester.
Oh yes. It has been a VERY eventful five months. Apologies in advance for the wall of text. I’ve owed you a massive update and here it is. Haha. 

So student teaching went very well. My mentor teacher was incredibly helpful and we had a very good dynamic between the two of us! Our honors kids had a lot of trouble at first, coming back to school especially in the middle of a pandemic. Over the months they significantly improved but a lot of them still had issues even to my last day. Regrettably, I never got to teach the two senior classes. My mentor teacher had them on a VERY TIGHT leash. It sucked but I still got to talk to a lot of them and help with their writing. 

As the semester went on and on, I was actually asked by one of the other teachers in our hallway to be her longtime sub whi... Read more
I did have a library interview and I did really well, well enough that they asked for references, but now it’s the holiday so who knows how that’s going? lol. Hoping for the best.

This is [[k0sh3k]]: what would it take to add library certification?
Going back to school not at UofL. Cause they don’t offer it. I may look into it though!
I'm still thinking about what you said.

No apologies necessary for the wall, of course. =D. You'll never write enough for my taste.*
Hope you made some good alcohol for x-mas when you got back.
No doubt, it is a difficult time to enter into that vocation. A time of crisis.
I can imagine there wasn't much you could do to help so many. That powerlessness sucks.
That illiteracy is widespread. Huge jump from the honors courses, surely.
In a sense, I think most teachers who don't have wealthy or self-motivated students are set up for failure in public schooling.
What did you mentor teacher says about the substitution situation?
And, as to your fight story, I have a nearly identical one in my first year.
I did not intervene other than to stand and loudly tell them to stop. I cannot say stepping in is necessarily the moral thing to do (I think that depends on the circumstances quite a bit).
You may still teach. I do not know.
Glorified babysitters, wranglers, and social workers in disguise.
I think you'll also often find that "the moral thing to do" in a teacher's shoes will get you fired.
To my eyes, it's undercover work, since you're fighting the system itself.
It's a deeply underappreciated and misunderstood vocation (even by many of the prison guards who work the job).
My mentor teacher did a lot to help me mitigate the issues but she could only do so much having her own students to worry about. 

The way I see it. I still have my degree so there’s nothing stopping me from trying again once things level out from COVID. Working on the west end of Louisville was 100% not for me either. I am disappointed in myself, but I also think taking some real time to evaluate my future path is probably good right now.
Also good morning!
Good morning. =)
I'm glad you'll be standing back up to fight again.
Hurts like a bitch.
Yeah… it’s hard. But everything will be okay. If anything, not being so fucking busy anymore gives me time to get back to work on my hobbies, reading, writing, and talking to folks too!
