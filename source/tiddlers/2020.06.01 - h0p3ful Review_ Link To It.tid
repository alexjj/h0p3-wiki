*[[Fun TDL.TDL]]
** Lowercase, please.
** It is empty. You should put stuff in here. 
*** For example, why not make a pornstash? Check out Veracrypt if you want to make it so no one can see (though, keylogging and many other attacks would work). 
*** A list of games? 
*** I don't know, whatever you think is fun.
*[[Notage Ti.28]]
** I like how you have leveraged your [[Notage]] as a buffer. You gotta get it out. It's like spinning up a text editor to get do it. I lurv it.

** Yeah, we had a really tough 15 minutes there in [[Family Time]]. Overall, though, it wasn't "the worst" to my eyes. We had a good time in general. I'm glad we did it.
*** Yes, you are correct: you are engaged in hyperbole. 
** Did your alarm clock go off at the appointed time today?
*[[2020.05.31 – Prompted Introspection: Fantasy]]
** Link to it, homie.
** I'd like to see a link to [[Books]] or [[Deep Reading]] or something like that too.
*[[2020.05.31 – Carpe Diem: 10:30]]
** Ditto.

** Weaksauce, sir. =)

** I like how you are aiming to be careful. When you go out of your way to say "some," you provide the forks that are so often necessary for wise reasoning. 
** I am not sure if that is why most religions exist. I would argue, instead, that religions tend to arise to explain our (and the world's) relationship to the divine, generally attempting to right that relationship in some respect. 
** It is important to recognize what it means to say that "science" can //prove// anything. Do they offer proofs like we have in logic? They give us reasons based on evidence and methods that we hold in high regard, yes, but there is something probabilistic about it that merits investigation. 
*** As a contextualist, we may be willing to say these consist in proofs. It depends on how you want to define these terms.
** Some may have a problem with the conflation of //god// with the //divine//. 
** It is unclear what you mean by "rules of life."
** I like what you are pushing for here. Keep going.

** [[2017.06.01 Reflection]]: Preach, yo! =)
** Compare [[2018.06.01 -- Free reading]] to your [[The Lightning Thief]] work. My god. You put forth great effort in both of them, and it shows. Bravo, sir.
