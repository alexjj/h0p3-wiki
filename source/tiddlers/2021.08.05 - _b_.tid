I'll agree that the sybil misinformation attack is a form of censorship. Flooding us with bullshit disrupts and sometimes drowns out what is [[salient]]. Clientside F2F moderation/curation multiverse model seems the only fair way out, with federation holding the backups and providing the footholds where necessary.

Oh, yes, surely, I am the autistic weirdo victim people have encouraged and deceived in one way or another until I felt validated in every insane deviant thought I've had. Now, I have fallen into true depravity. None of this up to me anymore. Complete and total NPC. I'm just here for the ride like the rest of you.

Taleb is wrong, again. (SOMEONE ON THE INTERWEBS IS WRONG I TELL YOU!!!!). Hyberbolically pithy but unfortunately inaccurate, yet again. Reactionary rhetoric, `/puke`. =D. Perhaps one of the differences between slaves and modern employees is that slaves didn't have to commodify their minds so thoroughly that kowtowing included the emotional labor of unfailingly flattering and showering adoration upon one's buyers and owners down to every single detail imaginable. The intelligence of your enemy requires more from you to survive, and that has only increased the pressures people feel. Further, our enslavement is empowered by technologies that can dehumanize and alienate us from ourselves in ways simply unimagined by the ancients beyond prescient [[Straussian]] metaphors. They never had double-edged swords that could eat the world in the blink of an eye.

I am generally always interested in what it means to relate outside and inside worlds. Elaborate, please.
