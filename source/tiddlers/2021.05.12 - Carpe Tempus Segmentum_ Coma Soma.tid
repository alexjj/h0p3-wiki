title: 2021.05.12 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Coma Soma

Double Dark Chocolates. [[TTTOTW]]. Sleep by 4?

Woke at 11? Coma soma sleep. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! Hung out with [[pinephone]] devs. I'm trying to understand their {[[dreams]]} and motivations. The problem of fragmentation is quite clear here. Deathmist is an interesting kid. 

Cleaning. Hugs'n'bugs. Offspring aren't proud. My wife is flooded, as we anticipated. Holding off on insulation now. Not clear now is the right time. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Canvassing.

Wrestled her machines away because she won't get off the clock. Get pissy all you want. =). Times up.

//The Walk//. Ran into Dave. He grew up in this 200 yard radius area. Talked with us about how to get into the woods and about the town. He's been a music teacher for 25 years (he sounds exhausted), and his school is right next door to the divinity school. Coincidence. I asked him about the gnome army art of his lawn. He asked me what I do, and as usual, I don't have a great elevator speech. He says he and his wife are down for dinner whenever. Still, want the offspring to get their shots (they still haven't scheduled, and my daughter is working on selling the vehicle too). My wife continues to look up all the plant life around us (autist :P). 

Shopping @ W-Entity, returned cups, grabbed fruits and veggies. 

//Skintime// + //The Office// until I fell asleep. I would die happy like that.

[[Family Gathering]]. [[5c0ut]] made dinner. Stirfry, pickled veggies, and his take on salabao with biscuit dough (it was awesome; I should have got the hot sauce out). My daughter took us into the territory of [[Justice]]. It was a somber conversation, as it usually is. She cannot stop poking me and feeding me quarters. That person. Son's new tactic in arm wrestling is to tell me how sexy I am so I'll laugh. It does throw me off my game. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Watched lolvods with [[5c0ut]]. He's doing a good job on his diet. [[TTTOTW]].
