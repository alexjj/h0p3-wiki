title: 2022.02.25 - Variety Creepy: Post-Test Anxieties

"""
[09:51:27] [[Variety Creepy]]: Hi! I'm here. Just like I said.
[10:09:16] [[Variety Creepy]]: Hello, h0p3!
[10:41:29] [[h0p3]]: Good morning, sir =)
[10:41:43] [[h0p3]]: Just got done making breakfast. Watching //ATLA// with [[ASK]]-sympaticon.
[10:41:51] [[h0p3]]: How has your day gone?
[10:42:18] [[Variety Creepy]]: The day went good. I had 3 tests today
[10:42:30] [[Variety Creepy]]: I'm confident that I did well in them.
[10:42:37] [[h0p3]]: Me too
[10:42:47] [[h0p3]]: What were the tests on?
[10:44:28] [[Variety Creepy]]: The first one was a MatLab test. It was 3 programs and I had to type them out and show the output. The second test was on Quantum Mechanical Treatment of Magnetic Materials and Dielectrics. The third test was on Python laboratory work we had done.
[10:44:59] [[Variety Creepy]]: And I just got the results of the tests I had last week. It was bad. Haha
[10:47:43] [[Variety Creepy]]: My score is 177.5/230. Average is 127/230.
[10:47:54] [[h0p3]]: Good.
[10:48:15] [[h0p3]]: Culling away people who won't make the cut in engineering.
[10:48:30] [[Variety Creepy]]: I'm above average, but I don't think I'm in the top 20%. 
[10:48:55] [[Variety Creepy]]: Yeah, but these scores aren't gonna shoo them away.
[10:49:36] [[h0p3]]: Finding your sea legs at college then.
[10:52:02] [[h0p3]]: What were problems you had to solve in Matlab and the Python lab? 
[10:52:27] [[Variety Creepy]]: On second thoughts, I think I can make the cut into the top 20%.
[10:53:01] [[h0p3]]: Make sure you spend as much time with your professors as you can, including their office hours and the moments before and after class. Do not allow your shyness to get in the way.
[10:53:15] [[Variety Creepy]]: What are office hours?
[10:53:19] [[h0p3]]: Oh.
[10:53:23] [[h0p3]]: Hrm.
[10:53:37] [[Variety Creepy]]: I mean, please explain. It might exist in my college too.
[10:53:38] [[h0p3]]: Well, do you have TAs who hold hours outside of class?
[10:54:01] [[h0p3]]: Well, office hours are times set aside outside of class for you to speak with the leaders of the class.
[10:54:19] [[Variety Creepy]]: Um, no. I don't think we have that/
[10:54:31] [[Variety Creepy]]: But all the professors are approachable all the time.
[10:55:05] [[Variety Creepy]]: I have their phone numbers. I can text them. I can go meet them in their office if I want to, but I have never done those yet.
[10:56:51] [[h0p3]]: Will their personal relationship with you affect your ability to access internships? I would be quite surprised if their letters weren't crucial to your ability to attend the graduate school of your choice.
[10:57:12] [[h0p3]]: Plus, gives you a chance to fill in any gaps you may have.
[10:57:44] [[h0p3]]: I would be surprised if they wouldn't have valuable perspectives concerning questions about the industry in your city.
[10:58:07] [[h0p3]]: You're on the job.
[10:58:45] [[Variety Creepy]]: Letter of Recommendations are given to anyone who asks, sometimes it is the student who writes the letter and the professor just signs it with his name. But yes, staying in touch helps a lot!
[10:58:57] [[h0p3]]: Interesting
[10:59:18] [[Variety Creepy]]: I wouldn't want a letter from these people. I mean, I'm doing basic engineering stuff. This isn't even focused on my major.
[10:59:37] [[h0p3]]: Yes, sir. Alright.
[11:00:11] [[Variety Creepy]]: I'm kinda pissed that my score is low in electrical engineeing, but surprised in math
[11:00:46] [[Variety Creepy]]: I'm gonna start interacting more with the profs next semester.
[11:00:50] [[Variety Creepy]]: It's a promise to you.
[11:00:51] [[h0p3]]: Yes, sir.
[11:02:01] [[Variety Creepy]]: This semester is almost over, I'll try my best. Most profs already know me as the guy who attended the classes when there were tests going on. They all know me, but nothing otherwise.
[11:03:05] [[Variety Creepy]]: I got 32.5 in electrical and 28 in math. I was expecting 37+ in electrical and less than 15 in math. Lol
[11:03:50] [[h0p3]]: I am glad to hear your math is higher. I think it is an undervalued skill in many places that EEs may eventually end up.
[11:04:52] [[h0p3]]: (the majority of STEM students do not work in the direct field they studied here in the states)
[11:06:48] [[Variety Creepy]]: My professors all tell me that math is important
[11:07:24] [[Variety Creepy]]: I'm not that good in math, I hope that I can improve that skill in the next semester.
[11:08:00] [[h0p3]]: Let us consider that you do not feel good in math, but that maybe you've got actual and potential talent here.
[11:08:19] [[h0p3]]: Might not be the wizards you've met or have it come as natural to you as other things, I realize.
[11:08:58] [[Variety Creepy]]: Okay, I'm listening.
[11:11:29] [[h0p3]]: Oh, I haven't much to add to that. You've given me a range of answers on your self-evaluation of your math skills. You're in the right place to push the pedal to the metal. 
[11:11:47] [[h0p3]]: I'm excited for you.
[11:11:56] [[Variety Creepy]]: Thanks
[11:12:05] [[Variety Creepy]]: And sorry, I'm not answering properly today
[11:12:29] [[Variety Creepy]]: I'm not in the right mind as I'm busy checking my scores, comparing it with friends and stuff like that.
[11:12:44] [[Variety Creepy]]: I want my average to be in the top 20%
[11:13:11] [[h0p3]]: `/nod`. Completely understandable.
[11:14:47] [[Variety Creepy]]: I'm in the top 17% in 3 classes, top 21% in 1 class, 34% in the other, and 2 percent in another.
[11:15:09] [[h0p3]]: I like the gamification of it.
[11:15:40] [[Variety Creepy]]: When I take the average of it, it says 18
[11:15:55] [[Variety Creepy]]: Do you think I make the cut to be in the top 20%?
[11:17:32] [[Variety Creepy]]: I think I would be around the top 20%, give or take a couple of percentage.
[11:18:27] [[h0p3]]: Do all the students you wish to compare yourself to take the same classes?
[11:18:42] [[h0p3]]: Some programs are more set in stone than others.
[11:18:54] [[h0p3]]: And, are these classes with the same teachers?
[11:19:06] [[Variety Creepy]]: Yes, and yes again.
[11:19:13] [[h0p3]]: I've been in situations where there were 3 different teachers of the same course, and one of them was wildly harder, for example. 
[11:19:36] [[Variety Creepy]]: We get the same question paper.
[11:20:30] [[Variety Creepy]]: Even if it is a different teacher
[11:21:09] [[h0p3]]: Dope.
[11:21:24] [[h0p3]]: You'll get to a certain point in your schooling where the grades aren't what matter.
[11:21:46] [[h0p3]]: The best student in the class won't even care if they get a B. 
[11:22:20] [[h0p3]]: What the classes add to their own understanding of and work in the world is what will tend to matter the most. 
[11:22:52] [[h0p3]]: The comparison may matter significantly in your shoes though. I don't know.
[11:23:23] [[Variety Creepy]]: That is true,
[11:23:38] [[Variety Creepy]]: Okay, I'm freaking out now. My friends are all above me.
[11:23:51] [[h0p3]]: 6 classes seems like a heavy load. That's not all this semester, right?
[11:24:14] [[h0p3]]: If you're the smartest person in the room, you're often in the wrong room.
[11:24:36] [[Variety Creepy]]: 6 classe per semester.
[11:24:46] [[Variety Creepy]]: It might be considered heavy
[11:24:47] [[h0p3]]: 3 credit hours each?
[11:26:11] [[Variety Creepy]]: Let me check that
[11:26:53] [[Variety Creepy]]: 16 credits in total
[11:27:13] [[h0p3]]: Cool, labs, I take it.
[11:27:30] [[Variety Creepy]]: Oh wait. 
[11:27:37] [[Variety Creepy]]: I need to include labs too
[11:27:42] [[Variety Creepy]]: Make it 20 then.
[11:28:26] [[h0p3]]: Yes, sir. That is considered a significant load here.
[11:46:49] [[Variety Creepy]]: Welcome to India!
[11:46:49] [[Variety Creepy]]: Sorry for the late reply
[11:46:49] [[Variety Creepy]]: I was eating dinner. Mum forced me to sit at the dining table.
[11:47:05] [[h0p3]]: I'm extremely glad you did.
[11:47:09] [[h0p3]]: How was dinner with her?
[11:48:37] [[Variety Creepy]]: Thanks.
[11:48:41] [[Variety Creepy]]: It was good.
[11:48:47] [[Variety Creepy]]: I told her about the score.
[11:48:52] [[Variety Creepy]]: She wasn't satisfied.
[11:49:07] [[Variety Creepy]]: I could have done better. Closer to 200/230.
[11:49:36] [[Variety Creepy]]: She isn't wrong, but I don't have the will or the energy to slog 40 hours a week on studying.
[11:50:53] [[h0p3]]: Pomodoro technique may be valuable here. Makes it more palatable, and doesn't waste your time.
[11:51:32] [[h0p3]]: It's difficult to know how one should interpret a parent's disapproval as one ages. 
[11:52:38] [[Variety Creepy]]: I waste time majorly on Reddit and then on binge watching shows. 
[11:52:57] [[h0p3]]: I know the feeling. =D
[11:53:14] [[Variety Creepy]]: I have stopped caring about what my parents think about my grades.
[11:55:46] [[Variety Creepy]]: And I just deleted reddit!
[11:55:54] [[Variety Creepy]]: And Tumblr and YouTube
[11:55:58] [[h0p3]]: Haha. Noice.
[11:56:19] [[Variety Creepy]]: Now no more distractions.
[11:56:32] [[h0p3]]: Takes guts.
[11:56:41] [[Variety Creepy]]: The pomodoro technique seems nice. Does it actually work?
[11:57:00] [[Variety Creepy]]: I don't think so, I just hope that I don't install it for at least a month!
[11:57:47] [[h0p3]]: Pomo works for plenty of people. It's something you tune to your circumstances. 
[11:58:10] [[Variety Creepy]]: Oh, alright.
[11:58:25] [[h0p3]]: Virtuosos often divide their days into 2 sections of work, about 4-6 hours total. 
[11:58:33] [[Variety Creepy]]: Should I start preparing for the exams now? Or start tomorrow?
[11:59:25] [[h0p3]]: That's up to you, sir. I don't know enough. There are lots of valuable things to do with your time. 
[11:59:34] [[h0p3]]: You have a month until the exams, right?
[11:59:58] [[Variety Creepy]]: I can't go for 2-3 hours in oen single sitting. So virtuosos is ruled out.
[12:00:17] [[Variety Creepy]]: Yes, a bit less than a month. It starts on 21st March
[12:01:11] [[h0p3]]: Maybe working on Ubuntu?
[12:01:44] [[h0p3]]: Fun and productive, take your mind off things too.
[12:02:27] [[h0p3]]: (Should definitely try Manjaro out too...pacman/aur is hard to beat, imho...though you can use JuNest to get around this problem in Ubuntu)
[12:02:51] [[Variety Creepy]]: Hmm. Yeah, I'd prefer something else. Not in the mood for ubuntu.
[12:03:13] [[h0p3]]: What are your list of projects other than school then?
[12:03:59] [[Variety Creepy]]: I'm not doing anything other than school. I know I should be, but not started yet.
[12:04:17] [[Variety Creepy]]: There is one, which is work in progess
[12:04:22] [[Variety Creepy]]: Progress*
[12:05:04] [[Variety Creepy]]: It's an idea, and I have been making progress in it.
[12:05:28] [[Variety Creepy]]: Not it's good enough to start coding for it yet.
[12:05:53] [[h0p3]]: Writing it out makes a ton of sense.
[12:06:15] [[h0p3]]: Brainstorm, explore, build up streams and gardens of thoughts.
[12:06:35] [[Variety Creepy]]: I am writing it down. But most of them are sketches, flow charts and stuff like that.
[12:07:07] [[h0p3]]: I will continue to argue for the digitization of your notes, including your drawings.
[12:07:38] [[h0p3]]: (and, TW is self-hosted and private by default...you own the data, including who can access it...by default, that is no one but whoever has access to your machine)
[12:08:19] [[Variety Creepy]]: And then again, I'm a paranoid, anxiety ridden idiot. 
[12:08:28] [[Variety Creepy]]: Can you please send the link to TW?
[12:08:35] [[h0p3]]: https://tiddlywiki.com/
[12:09:30] [[h0p3]]: It comes with the ability to encrypt the entire document (have to enter a password to decrypt it). You can also use tools like this: https://www.veracrypt.fr/code/VeraCrypt/
[12:10:13] [[h0p3]]: Though it comes with a drawing utility, you might find TW isn't what you want for drawing (though embedding images in the same directory is easy). 
[12:10:58] [[h0p3]]: If the paranoia runs deeper and must be sated, my previous advice about the LUKS setup is worth your time (assuming you can't devote a device entirely to it). 
[12:14:36] [[Variety Creepy]]: Okay, I may be sleep-deprived but how do I write my own tiddly post?
[12:14:50] [[Variety Creepy]]: Like, I'm trying, but I cannot find.
[12:15:15] [[h0p3]]: You'll need a saving mechanism. I suggest Firefox and https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/file-backups/
[12:15:21] [[Variety Creepy]]: I cannot devote an entire device for it right now, but probably in the future.
[12:15:57] [[Variety Creepy]]: FIrefox? Is it still good enough to be used?
[12:16:02] [[h0p3]]: Lol
[12:16:05] [[h0p3]]: <3
[12:16:12] [[Variety Creepy]]: I'm using Brave
[12:16:16] [[h0p3]]: `/sigh`
[12:16:36] [[Variety Creepy]]: So... Brave is the wrong choice here?
[12:16:49] [[h0p3]]: Imho, yes. 
[12:17:07] [[Variety Creepy]]: Can you explain why?
[12:18:12] [[h0p3]]: Continue exploring the world of FLOSS. https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/floss-and-foss.en.html
[12:19:30] [[h0p3]]: We sort of need to nail down what counts as [[good]] software in the first place. We need some standards to evaluate with. 
[12:21:44] [[Variety Creepy]]: So, brave is FLOSS but not FOSS?
[12:22:54] [[h0p3]]: Brave is free in many respects. 
[12:24:24] [[h0p3]]: Given that it uses Chromium underneath the hood, it's not free enough. 
[12:24:24] [[Variety Creepy]]: Hmmm, then I seriously didn't understand what you said.
[12:24:46] [[Variety Creepy]]: Oh right, the Chromium thing
[12:25:26] [[h0p3]]: You'll want many browsers, of course. Having one dedicated to TW alone makes sense.
[12:25:55] [[h0p3]]: You may find you'll want addons to complement/customize your environment further.
[12:26:46] [[h0p3]]: I have Brave installed on my system too*. 
[12:27:36] [[Variety Creepy]]: Yeah, I have multiple browsers but I use only 2 of them.
[12:27:49] [[Variety Creepy]]: I use Brave for regular stuff
[12:28:08] [[Variety Creepy]]: Chrome for college related stuf
[12:28:15] [[Variety Creepy]]: stuff*
[12:29:03] [[Variety Creepy]]: And another browser that doesn't do anything
[12:29:45] [[h0p3]]: Worth trying many out, again and again. You'll spend a lot of time in that interface.
