!! What kind of fairytale creature would you be?

I'm grateful to have the giggles in [[2019.01.10 - Prompted Introspection: Fairy Tale Creature]]. It's true. I can be other kinds of fairytale creatures too, I think. Sometimes I feel like a magical vine, the kind trying to crawl up in everyone's orifices. I do slither and creep often enough. I'm incorrigible, relentless in some cases, and annoying like a devouring weed out of control. I can be smothering and choking too. I'm also the kind of creature you'd want to let loose in your enemy's base, a trojan plant. 

Alright, that's enough answer for narcissistic me tonight. I need to go find some tentacle p0rn to masturbate to. Shooting strings of myself into the world, as always.
