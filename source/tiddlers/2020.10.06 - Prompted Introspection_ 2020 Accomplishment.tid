title: 2020.10.06 - Prompted Introspection: 2020 Accomplishment

!! What have you been able to accomplish this year that you are really proud of?

We were able to move up here under tight timing and overextended financial circumstances (with significant illness), rapidly deploying a base in this sphere while CV19 hit (it's good that I saw it coming early), continued transformation of my vocation, and having generated sufficient proofs to my offspring of their responsibilities (my son has grown ''so'' much; and it's been hell for him). Finding [[hope]] for my small circle was at least partially successful, though anxiety-ridden. We've been exceptionally lucky while the world has not. Bittersweet. We have pushed quite the pace this year, and I'm [[grateful]] for the effort of my family. I'm honored to contribute what I can to those I [[love]]. I am proud of my [[Applied Computational Existentialism]] effort in this [[vidya]] [[game]] of life.
