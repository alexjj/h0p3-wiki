!! Audit:

* Okay, so I've been very loose in how I complete my [[CDR]]s, [[Prompted Introspection]]s in particular. They've been more like a quota. 
** This doesn't capture my day-to-day feelings well enough, and that is a huge strike against it.
*** However, it has allowed me to Walk+Talk and use that flexibility for relief. The work is getting done, though it may not be the right kind of work.
* It's a [[power]]ful reflective experience to learn how to modify the [[Generic Prompts]], especially because I'm shooting for more objective, outside perspectives, simulating the generic [[Other]], [[WINTCIS]]. 
** I've noticed that I'm pushing back against myself quite a bit. I'm trying to figure out how to round the edges. 
** I still cannot see how far this process will go. Will it just flatten out? Will it continue to braid and yet clarify?
*** This is the most standard narratival component of this hypertext. 
** It feels less like Sunday School here. It feels closer to friendship. 
** There is a [[retroactive footnotes]] + [[audit]] + [[review]] process going on here, and it's in a single [[Project|Projects]] [[Directory]] namespace. 
*** It even feels like a subwiki. 
* I love how disgusting I get to be. That's me!
* This continues to be a damned useful bridge with my offspring. 
* This is still the primary {[[Vault]]} constructor/farmer.
* I feel like this is also a practicing ground for conversations. [[Sphygmus]] identified this before long ago. 
* I've been picking out more and more people in my life here. Dope.
* [[2020.06.10 - Prompted Introspection: Forth]] has been something I've been tacitly thinking about with [[Lojban]] too.
* Some of these have been link-heavy! 
** I don't predict it, but it would be amazing if it became increasingly link-heavy over time. What a way to bind a story together!
* Re-reading and thinking about these is always an emotional ride.
