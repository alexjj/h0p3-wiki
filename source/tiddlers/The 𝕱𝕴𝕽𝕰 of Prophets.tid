The Prophet's return is creative. He returns to insert himself into the sweep of time with a view to control the forces of history, and thereby to create a fresh world of ideals.

In true Me fashion, I cut through the peripherals and grabbed at the heart of his (Love?).

I found and have been reading a study guide for "Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals" this morning.

I've cried twice so far. In under thirty minutes. I understand a bit more about why I find this man so attractive. My heart feels bare, but not barren.

I'm up to four bouts of weeping.

His life is a love letter to this man.

I love the whole world.

* What breathes fire [[Itself]] into everything from seeming nothing? Who breathes fire into this qm-timeline?
* Self-Immolation, Balls of Lightning.
* Ho-ly scriptures, greatballsoffire! Memetic spellcasting in [[The Great Human Conversation]].
* The oracular irony of Prophet and Profit. "Ya gotta' have ambishun!" The reflexive and [[infinigress]]ive game of hunting for what matters.
* Elijah's dialectical self-prophesy as the fiery core metaphor of prophets reifying itself. That man knows how to speak fire, Fan them flames, and build firescraping signs toward the wisdom of all things.
* Triangulation of our Self-Models; sign, signified, signifier
* Ofc, the //Trees// of Israel, including those trees too, lol.
* When left with the impossible, ought we assume the impossible in some respect? Constructivist Iconography Examination.
