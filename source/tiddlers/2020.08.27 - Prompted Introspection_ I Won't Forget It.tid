title: 2020.08.27 - Prompted Introspection: I Won't Forget It

//I'm breaking one of my rules: injecting a [[prompt]]. Forgive me, Samwise. It's an old one, but it still checks out, I believe.//

!! Describe an incident that had something to do with water.

I stumbled across [[2017.12.04 - Prompted Introspection Log: The Water Incident]] today. I've searched my wiki and my snapshots for what I thought I had written down.<<ref "B">> I swear I had written it down. Feels like I did. I must be delusional and confabulating a [[phenomenology]]. What I thought was my memory of writing it down is incorrect (or maybe I didn't save it).<<ref "s">> I don't know. I know I'm even wronger somewhere though.

This canoe story wasn't found. Well, shit. That's an important one to me.

IIRC, I may have been 14ish. It was after our move away from the Mannsville area, and we revisited our old region, and dontcha ca-noe we were there to k-new for a day. We were past the dam on the outflow of the Green River Lake. [[SLT]] and I were in one canoe with the cooler, and [[JRE]]+[[AIR]]+[[MWF]] in the other. We were foolishly showboating and having fun going backwards in our canoe on a faster part of the river, and we flipped. Time slowed down, and we both instantly reached for each other in the swirling water and tried heaving each other up to make sure they could breathe. We worked to guarantee the safety of [[the other]] first. There was an existential moment under the water where we both realized what the [[the other]] was doing, and it calmed, tickled, and touched us both.<<ref "i">> I won't forget it.

<<footnotes "B" "I'm feeling the need for something like a BERT-empowered semantic search tool. I wish I could just ask a question and the probabilistic associations alone would likely pull me to the right surface. Will the real Jeeves please stand up? I imagine a limited context search story river stamped with probability distributions and ordered by what is likely most [[salient]] to the query. Crazy hella' advanced versions of this would actually show branches of inferences (like those I have in my [[Wiki Review]]s).">>

<<footnotes "i" "I am...the profane ruiner of moments and the remembrance of all that is holy (this is what footnotes are for!). I just can't hold my breath or my tongue for very long (lawd knows what [[Freud|Freud and Beyond: A History of Modern Psychoanalytic Thought]] thinks of this leap in logic): Deepthroating is such a unique way to demonstrate that you temporarily care about the [[other]]'s pleasure more than your own breathing. (Yes, I would laugh at a funeral which is why I don't get invited to them or I'm put in the back room with the other retards [muh tru homies] where I belong.)">>
