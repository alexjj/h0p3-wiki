Hi [[Jaxx]]. My opinion is that it should be FLOSS, but I've already said what I need to publically, and I'm not here to argue it. Linux users may want to consider bubblewrap or firejail. Sandboxing doesn't solve a variety of problems, but it is also better than nothing in some cases. If you use Windows, there a variety of sandbox tools available that might help alleviate some of your concerns.

Full virtualization is a fine sledgehammer too, especially within a setup like Whonix.

The mail was never received, but I hunted your account down anyway and sent you an invite (you've not accepted) yet. I am tickled that you sent the message from [[DarkMX]]. I [[hope]] you'll be tickled that I've answered by my ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱.

Hi. Check your mailbox/inbox on Retroshare from me using the node ID Jaxx(Tor) .. There should be my old RS Info with my RS ID etc as well as my new RS ID. Check it. Add my new RS ID that is in there and once you have added my new one,mail me back here on Darkmx or mail me back on my new RS ID
