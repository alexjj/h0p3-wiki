title: 2021.07.20 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: So Much Reading

Woke at 3. Back feels odd. She might be right about the mattress. =(. Solid sleep though. [[TTTOTW]]. Back in some kind of groove. Ranga came down for pets, ignored the kitty krack. Aight. [[TTTOTW]]. He came down for pets again. I think he wants something, pointing me somewhere else, but I don't know what he wants. `/sigh`. I'm sorry cat. I'm dumb.

Vapelyfe. [[TTTOTW]].

Millennial breakfast. Asked her about her dope study translation. Blew my mind by describing the competing demographics of Judeo-Christian traditions that fail to interpret Garden, Fall, City. She thinks it's pretty standard for self-described Christians to believe (even though largely implicitly) they are aiming for The Garden. Wat. You gotta be fucking shitting me, woman.

[[TTTOTW]]. [[Morning Routine]]. Hugs'n'bugs. She sounds quite unhappy this morning, and he's alright. [[TTTOTW]]. Preserved the final Discord log; a treasure to me. Took down the basic info I may need one day. Also, I have a fucking monster to hyperread, and then hopefully I can scrub.

I continue to pester my offspring remotely and in-person. I've discovered why they are so tired: they were up late playing. Of course. Jerky, Dark Chocolate, [[TTTOTW]]. Brain hurts. It's so much to swallow, drowning. More checking in, and more sadness.

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! Nap. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]

[[Morning Routine]]. Prepped dinner with my offspring. Chilled with her. Second in command has asked her to be the primary consultant for a new group that is shaping policy and procedures surrounding accountable collections, missing items, etc. for all libraries at Yale; said they want to crib off what she's done. She's got a month to prepare. It's logistics meets quality assurance, she's good at it, and she knows how to speak in their languages too. I'm always jelly of her raw competence. It's kinda disgusting. Still begging her to take some mental health days (as she advises others to do, hypocrite! :P). //Skintime//.

[[Family Gathering]], ghetto al pastor tacos, mole and rice, water. //Arrested Development// + //Skintime//. I'm eating it up.
