title: 2020.07.31 - Prompted Introspection: Selfish Death

!! How would you like to die?

I'm not sure if I should keep this question. I've got some fairly thorough answers in [[2017.05.24 - Prompted Introspection Log]], [[2017.06.17 - Prompted Introspection Log]], and [[2019.09.20 - Prompted Introspection: Like To Die]]. I despise how Lady Melisandre-esque this question is, but it seems like such a basic being-toward-death question that I need to leave it and keep answering it. Ugh. Okay.

It reminds me of how I don't want to die more than how I want to die. I'm aiming to be practical here. I hope I'll have stage 4 cancer and a reason to take my own life in a controlled even pleasurable manner. I'd want to say my goodbyes and give my thanks to people who made my life worth living. I don't think I'll have any resources to bequeath, and I doubt my affirmations will matter.

I want to die in a place where my body can just be left there. I want to die before my wife, son, and daughter would. I think they could live with me being dead (I work for that), but not the other way around. I want to die sooner rather than later. I'm glad I still have reason to prolong the inevitable.

I'd like to die in a forest, near running water, with my [[monster]], a last hit of bliss, and then OD on heroin while I say, "I [[love]] you" to those closest to me. I assume it will be far more painful, expensive, ugly, unromantic, and undesirable. Still, a man can {[[dream]]}.
