title: 2020.11.15 - Prompted Introspection: Recent Gift

!! Write about the most recent gift you gave someone.

Does my penis count?<<ref "t">> No? Shucks.<<ref "i">> 

It's not so obvious to me what counts as a "gift." Sacrificially giving anything without expecting (which is not the same thing as predicting) reciprocation seems like a start.<<ref "p">> Is it a gift if I've given someone something they didn't appreciate? Or, better yet, is it even a gift if they do appreciate it if I didn't intend for them to appreciate it? How tangible must it be? Could even having an unspoken thought be a gift? It seems possible under some circumstances. What about my silence? Lol. Sometimes that counts too.<<ref "w">>  Is it one of them "I know it when I see it" kinda things? Maybe. Without nailing this down, I'm going to have to caveat my answer with a "I don't know if this the //most// recent, but it's recentish." Alrighty then. 

I gave money to someone who needed it.

<<footnotes "i" "What an uncomfortable [[prompt]]...I'm going to inverse shit-sandwich it. Like any truly authentic genuine hipster, I can't even handle my own sincerity without a chaser of irony (and a hint of [[arrogance]]). I admit that answering the question endangers the very status of the answer, so I must throw tomatoes of sinister nescience to protect its integrity.">>

<<footnotes "p" "The secret key to defining words boils down to passing the buck to other words. Yes, you know what //sacrifice// means, dontcha? Surely, there's no Strangely_Closelooped-Wittgensteinian-Baudrillardian-[[Pure-Simulacrum|Simulacra and Simulation]]-Ladder-reference-meaning-justification-problem here (if someone could kindly translate that into a single German word for me, I'd appreciate it [that would be such a gift to me]). I think taking a shit on accounts of internalism counts as a gift to [[Humanity]] (or that's what I tell myself, XD). You're welcome! <3 `/muchas smooches`">>

<<footnotes "w" "Like their users, [[words|Alias]] are so fucking stupid sometimes, ([[ITS]], excepting instances of '[[ITS]]'). Lol. I swear to god, Samwise, you drive me up the wall. I think me trying to ~~joke about~~ answer your dumb ass question is really, really the most recent gift I've given someone.">>
