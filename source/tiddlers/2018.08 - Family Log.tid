<<footnotes "2021.09.04-2" "A painful process, no doubt. You have caused negative feelings in every person for this one, but it has been quite worthy. Your wife is still the most technically competent librarian at every library she works. Your offspring have a chance to be hackers if they want, and, at the very least, they've gotten their hands dirty and made real things that help us. Your son, in particular, doesn't hate his computer anymore. You did a good job, even though it was so expensive.">>
