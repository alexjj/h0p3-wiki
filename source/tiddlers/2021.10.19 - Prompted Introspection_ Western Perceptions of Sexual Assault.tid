title: 2021.10.19 - Prompted Introspection: Western Perceptions of Sexual Assault

!! Does modern western culture encourage women either to overreact or underreact to "minor" sexual assaults, such as groping, too-drunk sex, etc.?

It's quite difficult to sum up modern western culture as this monolithic object (and, presumably, we're not talking about modernism here either; you mean "contemporary"). There's not only signficant variance in what consists in a contemporary western subculture, there's also plenty of variance in what is considered a "minor sexual assault" (including my own disagreements about what counts as that),<<ref "a">> perceptions of their problematicity, let alone that I don't know the actual consequences for these behaviors in the many contexts we're considering here. I only have guesses, as usual. I can find subcultures that overreact, and I can find subcultures that underreact, and I can't say the rate of either is stable, consistent, well-measured, or easily known. 

Yet again, we are at the problem of consent, not the least of which requires fleshing out an understanding of the virtuous agent's perception (let alone knowledge) of [[salience]] (likely in [[TOP]]) and an analysis of moral agency. For a moral perfectionist (`/raises hand`, and I'm talking about the technical concept here, again) who is not convinced that there's nearly as much preference freedom and spaces of imperfect duties (that, in fact, our moral lives are largely radically defined for us in Hohfeldian analysis that demonstrates mostly perfect moral obligations) as the average Neo-Kantian (in no small part because I take us to be making a moral choice with how we spend even our moments of time in a way that many find repugnant), I don't think consent structures are as pervasive (though still quite pervasive) in the world. It is my experience that most people really have chosen to be slaves to their passions, that they tend to be unreflectively driven by their poorly trained (though relatively coordinated, manufactured, and constructed for maintaining egoism, capitalism, anti-realism, etc.) moral intuitions. I think that what most people choose, feel, and believe in this context is a joke, at best.

Sexuality is also not so easy to define the more I look at it. The libinidal aspects of our identities appear more far reaching than our initial or commonplace intuitions about sexuality might suggest. We'd like to draw the lines of unwanted advances carefully, even on the grounds of "I know it when I see it." But, as I have pointed out, I don't trust how the people I encounter (and I am a student of people) believe based upon what they see. I think this problem is particularly interesting to autists because we are so mindblind, and, for the high-functioning, often aware of it (even if only indirectly and inarticulately). It is quite instructive to know that one often fails to effectively model or predict a theory of the mind of [[the other]]. What does it mean to be informed about how informed another is, to know the intentions of each other, including into the problematic [[infinigress]]es we face? I feel commonly violated on this very issue all over the place (and I know I tend to put in way more effort than [[the other]]s I meet here), but I also think I have to react carefully (and, most people will agree, in the end, I am a highly reactive player<<ref "s">>). It is wiser to be [[robust|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle]]ly hedged-conversative, I agree. Further, I also think we should be slow to punish people for microaggressions, less significant failures to game-theoretically cooperate, and tiny infractions. As an autist who has had to learn to become someone who can tell his [[fff]] stories of what is good and evil in each person he encounters, no one would have much of a life if I held everyone accountable for everything (and, I'd argue I hold people accountable in an extreme manner as it is). There has to be tolerance here, and the consequences for not making room for error here are far, far reaching (and I consider this one of the most fascist and selfish aspects of many of those who call themselves [[pleft]]ists).
