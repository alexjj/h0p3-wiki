*** Backup, but no compression
**** `# RESTIC QUICKSTART FOR LINUX`
**** `# Choose where you want to save your backups`
**** `MYREPO=/mnt/mybackupdrive/somefolder`
**** `# Initialize a new restic repo at your chosen backup location`
**** `restic init -r $MYREPO`
**** `# Backup your files to the newly created repo`
**** `restic backup /my/files -r $MYREPO`
**** `# To restore a backup, first mount the repo`
**** `restic mount /mnt/backedup -r $MYREPO`
**** `# Browse the latest backup at /mnt/backedup/snapshots/latest`
**** `ls -la /mnt/backedup/snapshots/latest`
**** `# Copy the files you want to restore out of the repo`
**** `cp -r /mnt/backedup/snapshots/latest/directory-to-restore ~/restored`

*** Continued arms race in shelling and tracing. Mixed bag for me since we really can't own the means of production of that protocol. Obviously, I think it's much easier to take my domain from me than to take protonmail's down (which is hardly a claim that this is sufficiently secure or that it has the fitting ownership model).
