*** If you have a mental health problem, they don't want you. You have to hide it.

*** And for those who do secure an academic post, census data suggest that close to a third of part-time university faculty—many of whom are graduate students—live near or below the poverty line.

*** Your circumstance is nearly a unicorn bubble.
** Plenty of anecdata:
