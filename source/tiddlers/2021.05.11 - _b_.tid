Student's arduous perspective: I'm nodding my head to your recent virus. You're doing it! It's amazing. =). Floating spirits in the wind. Honey rather than vinegar. I hope to be someone who seeks ignorance without malice in all. Toss it in a bubble. I admire the exaggeration in your language, including celebrating the consensual hunting of people for...sport. It's good rhetoric, and you wear your heart on your stylish sleeve (that alone may negate any relevance of what I think, and you already know what I think). Not like all the other ~~girls~~ ~~subreddits~~ social media sites. Your essence is different. Essentially, one of the properties is an anti-essential playground attempt (and you are quite skilled at it). What is this? What is isness? What in the isness is this? The Truth is solid among the fluid. Who does not copy the recipes our cultures provide? We must riff because we can't start from scratch. You still have to pick ends for mutation and selection. You and I both know what your {[[Axioms]]} mean, imho. I think you are de-WEIRDifying, seeking relationships over abstract categories. Distancing yourself from the dogmatism of morality (celebrating the relativity of style) in name while obviously embracing it in practice (with an unspoken social contract). It's downright [[Straussian]], constructing grounds for civil discourse in some cases, and perhaps even an attempt at decentralizing the construction of a shared altar. You can overcurate your conversations together I suppose. Still centrally controlled with the appearance of tolerance. Also, [[PSM]]ing is about consistently putting our skin in the non-mere game on-the-wire (where consistency itself is also part of our skin). I don't think [[PSM]]ing is concerned with being directly connected to or gathered around my site at all. I [[aim]] for [[PSM]] to be a much broader label than using wikis too (yes, I'm telling you that many pornstars are PSMing). But, ofc, I think wiki-like structuring is still the best approach for a large percentage of the job atm (connecting and unifying our digital identities into a single model is hard to do). [[DrDeezee]] is a fine counterexample, he was [[PSM]]ing decades before I ever met him. He's built many homes online, though he has been nomadic. There's quite a story there. Aside: I've largely stopped generating notifications for others in my life; I try to take their precious attention only when they've explicitly intended to seek me out.

Apparently, one person's upvote is not identical to another's. They tend not to be the same currency. How do we best attempt to make coherent and compatible the various methods of signaling? How can we make sure everyone puts their skin in the game correctly? F2F still seems the only route. I suggest it may be worthy for negative signaling to require a higher threshold of user interaction. Words often require more skin in the game than than just a button, at least for now. Perhaps downvote buttons should be earned, but all downvotes should require skin in the game comments (something I've probably changed my mind on). Still, popularity contests in positive signaling is deeply flawed too. I just want to connect with the right signals from the right people at the right times in the rights way for my contexts. Please. Plz. PLEASEDSJSLKfadf;lkjdf;lkasjfd;laskfj.

I love your mother, Mark, you transnumale faggot incel. So, grill on them grillers. Gift them hao 2 grill books (preach). Grill the grillers. Grill them. Grill. Learn to laugh or be consumed by it. Would you like a menstrual pancake or a cum omelette tonight? What about some fresh bull yogurt? I'm a vegan who trains crossfit, and I use Arch Linux. I'm just Saiyan you should Goku...the dentist to take care of your luxury bones.

Yeah, polishing my wiki is like polishing a car~~-bomb-~~ or a knob. Pat me down for weapons, and I'll cum with our bare hands.

Don't kill your son! Just cut off part of his dick...The goyim know. Shut it down.
