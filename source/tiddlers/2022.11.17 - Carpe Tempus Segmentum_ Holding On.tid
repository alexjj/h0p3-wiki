title: 2022.11.17 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Holding On

Attempted to convince my daughter to use her time wisely. PBJ and water. [[TTTOTW]] + //House of the Dragon//. Noodles and broth. 

Woke at 12:15? Meditation. //Skintime// with my sympaticon.

Mi amor was excited. There was a talk on the commodification of the library, the problems of retail langauge and mindsets in the vocation, etc. 

Grilled cheese with my sympaticon. Attempted //The Rehearsal//, but fail.

Offspring came down to grind. Son had a question. Whiteboard. Dialecture. Testing and [[Trust]]ing Trust. Called ISP up. Said they'd call back momentarily. Presumably, they have no clue. Returning slippers. Decided I'm going to downgrade my [[MuWire]] and leave it up. Added to [[The Bootable USB Thumbdrive]].

Went up to construct a draft deck with folks. 

//The Walk// with mi amor. Cold AF. Clarinet.

Constructing decks with my sympaticon.

[[Family Gathering]] was solid. We had lentil porridge. Well, I can sometimes anticipate the problems, but I usually can't solve them for another. `/shrug`. //Mr. Robot//. [[The Cannabis Microgrowery]] is my goal for next July. That's when it will be legal.

Put mi amor to bed. Chilled a bit with offspring.

//Skintime// + //Red Rising// @4:4:10:41 with my sympaticon. Sleep by 9:30?
