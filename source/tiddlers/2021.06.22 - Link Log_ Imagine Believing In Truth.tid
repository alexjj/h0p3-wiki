*** Okay. This is much closer. Thank you. I take it you are listening (call me delusional). Decentralize until it hurts, then centralize until it works, rinse and repeat. You still have to show me how the workers are going to own the means of production as far down as we can. That there's a chance to distill big.corps' models into small ones by accepting tradeoffs on compute for throughput and latency seems constructive to me. Go forth and succeed in enabling others, please.
