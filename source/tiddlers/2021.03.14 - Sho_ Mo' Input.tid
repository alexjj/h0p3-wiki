Hey dude

I'm so sorry it's taken me so long to write back. 
I think I got a bit overwhelmed with the tech stuff lol

I suppose looking at switching to FF and Protonmail is probably worth it, in the long-term.
Then again, my Amazon account knows so much about me, does it make a difference?

I don't have much to add, despite two months having passed. I fucking hate humans, especially capitalists, so there's nothing new, really.
I need to familiarise myself with what is going on in Scottish politics because I've been avoiding it. I've been avoiding COVID news, too, just let Ed tell me what he reads.

We watched a documentary about the 'new silk road' China is building... they are some evil cunts, for sure.

Can you elaborate on this bit specifically, please?
"De-googlifying your life otherwise is reasonable, especially if you maintain a google account just for the exceptions. We can walk through a list of services and tools you use to find alternatives, if you'd like."

Ed starts removing the asbestos roof tomorrow - well, half. We're doing the roof half at a time because the odds of weather being dry enough long enough to do the whole thing at once are pretty fucking slim >:P 
It'll be good to have all that behind us, and be able to really move foward with the house.
We need to. We need to get our legal residence here sorted out so we can vote again and not have to pay extra council tax!

Anyway, sorry I've not written in so long and now I have nothing much to say :) 
Maybe count yourself lucky, though, haha

Hope you guys are good! Love to the family. Give [[k0sh3k]] a hug from me.

Sorry, man, just thinking about this in the back of my head, came up with a couple of questions.

If I set up a proton mail, and switch to using FF for everything, do I need to delete all my accounts (facebook, gmail, amazon) and start over?
But if I do that, then won't those things just get all the same information under the new email ID?
I would think it would be easier to just keep the things I've got but ... then what's the point of setting up a proton mail and getting off chrome?

I don't know, I'm trying to formulate a sort of 'to-do list' in a way, or an agenda of actions to take.
Can you help? I'm sorry! lol
