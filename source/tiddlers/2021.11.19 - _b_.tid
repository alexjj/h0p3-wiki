`/Schizoautistic INTJ Mode enable`: So far, the ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±, as distilled shadow[[wrestler|wrestle]], has handled, to the [[dok]] they are, the narcissists (today I encountered a [[Ribbonfarm]]-fan who appeared to claim I was either fearless or a sociopath like himself - this one's for you, kid, `/wink`) I've encountered reasonably well (far from great, obviously). Converting that energy into something constructive, automated polite-greyrocking (I suppose I was just a novelty to you), non-reciprocator unveiling ([[Reply Mode]] is painful, but it's been fairly effective at revealing commitment asymmetries almost across the board), baked in anti-gaslighting features, some [[fff]] opsec, and plenty of tools for argumentation (especially feeding them rope as mirror candy) goes a long way to subduing (if not bouncing) the parasites and vampires. I think part of what is considered obfuscatory mitigates bad [[faith]] interactions too (and, normally, I just play along with your fiction that you actually give a shit because I'm relatively confident the truth will be revealed to you; you, however, make it easy for us, outright denying it from the beginning - I have at least two interpretations of each person, and they are practically identical for you). Make it so costly for the [[naked]] egoist to deal with you that they'd prefer to seek pleasure elsewhere instead (similar to how highly-integrated sociopaths benefit from chaos because they grow and abuse the conditions of making sure accountably doing the right thing [including coming to understand what that is] together simply costs too much). I hope to become adept at it (I'm still a beginner). Obviously, I'm not saying I can't be tricked by imposters and posers (as the record shows); there are price-efficient guerrilla and flooding tactics, and, yes, my vulnerability is to-the-nines. But, overall, it helps that they know just how dedicated I am to my projects (that I'm willing to defect in very expensive cases too, so, if you're lazy, why mess with a madman?); it's clear I'm not their mirror, and it's too expensive to mirror me back. So, we get to see glimpses of [[the other]], and I [[aim]] to do so kindly, `/fedora-tip`. Also, protip, you can't [[hope]] to negate anything without actually empathizing with something outside yourself (and not merely a projected construction of your own mind mirroring itself back that you've rationalized as the truth to the point the lie grows to take control of you). Ironically, dealing with people who deep down take themselves to be the center of the universe as far as they care teaches me some of what real divinity means by counterexample; that's part of why I listen so carefully. Finding the source of incoherence is one of my teachers (thank god for folks like G.E. Moore who pick out reasons why you don't have the right to believe what you want to believe). Are you really trying to read your enemies? I am. Are you going to tell on yourself by calling it out? It's why seeking [[the other]] in dark-triads still has unintuitive merit. As one [[Root User]] has asked, I have tried to put the proverbial gun down, but I will not abide by the global state of affairs. People can change, even my enemies. I must [[love]] my enemies, and never give up loving them. The bottomline in the justification of giving, taking, and negotiating competing desires and beliefs is that shooting for what is externally and objectively normative always counts as the overriding reason, and there's no argument against it without already acknowledging it. As good praxis, m~~ow~~u that evil down. I appreciate that I can find some Reason in each person. Where required, I'm going to try to learn from anyone, 3% or [[other]]wise. You were almost honest. I guessed what you were from the first words you uttered to me (often before). Confirmed.
