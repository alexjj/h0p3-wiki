Your command of the history of philosophy, including bringing your own interpretation to the table, is wonderful. I [[hope]] you continue the journey, sir.

>  McDowell’s position is ultimately unstable, and in the final analysis falls victim again to the “oscillation” it is designed to avoid

From what I can see, it's an oscillation between a crookedly narrow foundationalism and a too charitable interpretation of coherentism. Of course, I remain unconvinced that McDowell isn't a moral anti-realist shielded by quietism.

> pushing back against the idea that Hegel subscribes to a form of monism about cognition sometimes called “panlogism,”...panlogism will be construed here to be the view that the world and everything in it exists as the projection and attempted self-comprehension of God, the Absolute, or Geist. Since Geist or, rather, the Hegelian Absolute […] is standardly taken to be itself spiritual or “mind-like” as opposed to physical, panlogism is, as understood here, merely another label for the philosophical position more ordinarily termed “absolute idealism.” 

I have no certain claim against panlogism. I'm forced to remain open to it. We're in deep speculative shit (and, it's our moral duty to make the best of it we can*), and as long as it's not at the expense of [[justice]] otherwise, I think creatures like us must continue to explore the beautiful insanity of it. It might be the case.

In a similar way to how I think the historical person we call Heidegger was probably an anti-realist, I think it might be fair to say historical Hegel was a monist and panlogist. I'm eons away from being an expert though. `/shrug`. And, more importantly, we don't have to accept these moves in [[Straussian]] analysis.
