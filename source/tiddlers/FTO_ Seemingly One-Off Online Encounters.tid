That thread is a travesty. I was happy to see your thoughtful charity. It's an expensive task.

This is me, btw (and, it's much larger than it looks): https://philosopher.life/

I talk with a lot of people, sometimes at great length (hundreds of pages when we're lucky).

It's a pleasure to meet you. My name is h0p3.

What parts of philosophy do you enjoy? (I don't mind extremely inclusive definitions and boundaries).

I've gotta go shopping real fast and make dinner. I'll be back to read your account later tonight.

smeerlappa 

I'm mostly interested in analytical philosophy specialized in logics. This is where I'm writing my thesis about, but almost anything I find very interesting, maybe except political philosophy I guess

h0p3

Cool, what logics interest you? What's your thesis on?

> Hi there. It's a pleasure to see you in this thread. You have a perspective the crowd doesn't want to examine carefully. There are kinds of knowledge that aren't strictly empirically justified, and insofar as science is a tool, it cannot pick out its own telos. If you ever need to speak with someone for any reason, HMU. I'm happy to be your random retard friend if you ever need one.

The funny thing is that Scientism is actually a real thing, but it is not about if science can be trusted for things like vaccinations.

> Scientism is the promotion of science as the best or only objective means by which society should determine normative and epistemological values.

It is just about if science can say things about other things than science related subjects, such as moral values or the proof for God.

I keep record of who I reach out to. 

Provides some transparency that I value highly. 

I've seen a lot of names for it. I'm not sure how to sum it up quickly. It's very large and serves many functions. 

It's a personal wiki, a garden for cultivating an identity, a tool for connecting with folks, and more.

I consider it good praxis. You were asking what the average person can do, and I think this can be a valuable approach.

ledocs 4:23 PM

u/I am completely unfamiliar with this software.  I don't understand if "Sorcery of the Spectacle" occurs on reddit or on Discord.  I downloaded Discord and opened it, the whole thing looks dangerous and frightening.  I'm lost.

ledocs 4:42 PM

My wife and I have a cat named Boudu.  I am unfamiliar with both reddit and Discord.

h0p3 5:25 PM

My wiki is completely separate. The discord is also completely separate from SoTS. 

SoTs is on Reddit, the Light on The Path server is on Discord, and the links I sent you were from my personal site.

My wife and I named our cats Ranganathan and Chairman Meow.

ledocs 7:40 PM

My wife is the cat 4eak, I'm just along for the ride.  So here's the thing.  I'm actually interested in straightforward philosophy, the kind that is taught in Western universities.  And the rest of my culltural interests are also pretty staid compared to the weirdness of this Discord thing, or maybe your wiki.  I've never been to a site that was remotely like your wiki before.  It took me forever to view your wiki, I kept getting a black screen.  If you want to know about me, I have a very traditional website/blog that I don't keep current, it did not generate much traffic, fabulous though it is:  www.ledocs.net

h0p3 10:41 PM

Thank you for the link, btw. I'm sad to see that you don't post anymore there. 

I hope you acquire your writers voice again.

I purposely don't track my users. I have little knowledge of who reads it without reading off their sites or messaging.

I am a formally trained analytic philosopher. Berea, LSU, and Tulane. The Statesman paper I sent you was for a [[Straussian]] (<--that's a link in my wiki) professor of mine. It is not representative of most of my academic work. I'm not an academic anymore though. I'm out. I write in my own gibberish and style, but I am happy to speak about your work, if you'd like.

Hello. This is out of the blue. My name is h0p3. I was internet stalking, of course, as one does, and I was interested in what you have to say on the various platforms (hence my reading your writing). I was hoping we could speak, perhaps bit by bit and maybe at length if and when we can. I can see you are a busy person. I'm interested in Urbit and would like to know yours thoughts on it. I speak exceptionally publically though (https://philosopher.life), and I ask you to consider taking steps to speak with me more anonymously if and when you do wish to speak.

h0p3 8:27 PM

Also, I'm a huge fan of personal wikis, and I adore [[Rust]] even if I can't use it.

Oct 25
dpc_pw 1:39 AM

Hi.

That's a really weird website (in a good way)! 

I don't understand what would speaking anonymously mean. My identity on reddit and elsewhere is known, so  I guess you mean your identity?

h0p3 10:45 AM

Yo. =)

Yeah, it is a weird site. Just trying to give you a heads up on the weirdo you'd be speaking with.

Happy to speak with any account.

h0p3 10:57 AM

Do you feel like Urbit is heading in a direction that will enable   the global poor to participate in the network?

dpc_pw 6:26 PM

It shouldn't cost too much to host your own planet, even on a feature phone or anything, so sure, I guess. 

dpc_pw 6:38 PM

In essence, Urbit ship is just like a web-browser 2.0 for an Internet 2.0.

h0p3 7:11 PM

How well does Urbit function right now regarding NATs? Are there any processes which tend to be less functional even on connections that tend to be hostile to users?

dpc_pw 7:26 PM

Star and galaxies need to be exposed on publicly routable IP thought, but planets work OK behind the NAT. I think current vere (urbit ship runner) implements NAT punching, potentially with help of the star, but I might be wrong about it.  Personally I never had any problems with it. 

h0p3 8:04 PM

To whatever degree, what are the points of centralization in practice? 

P2P seems to be harsher on battery life for mobile. This software doesn't seem crafted for it, but I was wondering if you knew anything about performance on phones for this (since that is the primary device available to most folks). 

dpc_pw 8:09 PM

It's not p2p in the typical sense. Typicaly p2p soft had bad battery life because it was doing a lot of chattering with random peers. Urbit ships are more quiet and communication with fixed set of peers, so I think it should be better.

But the phone is just one option. Hosting an Urbit in the cloud is not terribly expensive. I run my on Digital Ocean for like $10/mo (I'm overpaying, could be accomplished cheaper).

As for centralization, it remains to be seen in practice if any centralization points appear. RN it's a small project and group of people, enthusiasts so it's hard to tell. Technically it's pretty decentralized. Everybody runs their own ship and their ship talk to each other directly. Only OTA and peer discovery goes though a parent star, which can be changed if malicious.

h0p3 8:12 PM

I like the idea that my weaker devices might piggyback off of stronger, more reachable, or even dedicated devices. 

Do you believe this tool is ultimately destined to be run in a datacenter for the average user?

dpc_pw 9:32 PM

Possibly. As long as it's reasonably easy etc. Maybe people will run it from home from a dedicated appliance or something. It's hard to tell exactly right now. 

But knowing how lazy general public is, I think hosting like https://tlon.io will become popular very quickly, and majority of people will use it.

But as long as customers can export and migrate their ships to different hosting providers, that's still an improvement.

Hello. This is out the blue, and it's a weird message. I aim to [[Find The Others]]. I admire your openness and good faith efforts in building community. 

My name is h0p3. This is me: https://philosopher.life./

I'm reading your words, picking out what I find [[salient]] (and, you have quite a garden for me to wander). It is my honor to think about your thoughts and feelings, and appreciate your willingness to be a [[Public Self-Modeler]]. I admire your honesty, your pursuit of what matters most from as many perspectives as you can weave together into a prism, and your work of [[hope]]. I hold such a thing in high regard. 

I admire your rigorous dialectics, your praxis in speaking with anyone. You will even say things that hurt feelings but must be said, and I admire how you choose to speak and negate.

I admire how you fight for the poor. I admire how you openly admit your lack of [[power]] and understanding with humility, and you don't give up on finding answers. [[ridtyawtr]]. It is my honor to meet you.

h0p3 10:14 PM

I admire how you require your opponents to consider admitting a broader scope of possibilities in many cases. 

You remind me of an anarchist who aims to be reconstructive rather than selfishly fatalistic. You believe our fundamental autonomy is real.

h0p3 10:24 PM

We would likely have many significant disagreements. You will have to think about whether or not you wish to speak with me, of course. And, do remember: you may begin the conversation with me anonymously (I generally recommend it).

h0p3 11:09 PM

I'm using webarchive to look through your older work here.

I do not know how much you hold onto your older words.

h0p3 11:16 PM

I would be interested in discussing this: [Consensus Does Not Verify Objectivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOHyEitpuTw)

I believe in metaphysics. That is a difficult pill for many analytic philosophers to swallow in my experience.

h0p3 11:28 PM

I suggest the possibility that consciousness is some emergent property of our circuitry, but if there were such an emergence, from what I can tell, we would not be able to help ourselves to the claim that it fits and justifies physicalist models of reality.

I also suggest that even if our consciousness emerged as such that it does not imply that all degrees or kinds of consciousness rely upon such a mechanism. 

h0p3 11:40 PM

I can appreciate the difficulties you have faced on this platform (and perhaps others from what I can see). 

[[Humor]] may be worth your time.

I'm a huge fan of [[Dune]], btw.

Stendahl Syndrome and [[Awe]] seem to go together nicely.

I would be interested in a very careful set of definitions on Realism and Idealism (and any equally significant options).

We probably have a great deal to speak about for [[The Golden Rule]] (https://dungherder.wordpress.com/2017/11/03/the-golden-rule-is-a-terrible-way-to-treat-people/). 

Oct 23

Ah, I appreciate your criticisms of public schools. I have much to say about the topic of education; you may find it a useful bridge for us. Teaching is something I hold in high regard. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/7w9b85/i_want_to_live_in_a_world_where_monsters_are/du035hi/ is something we might have to think about carefully together.

Again, I am not sure how strongly you still hold your words. You may find my approach to moral realism expensive to wrestle with.

h0p3 12:09 AM

I would like to know your thoughts on Metamodernism, Positive Disintegration, The Dialetheia, and Saint Hegel.

h0p3 12:20 AM

Substance use is something we both have in common.

I'd like to know if you would agree to the claim that China is hypercapitalist (we agree they are fascists) and has a great in common with US in this regard.

I am sorry to hear of your grandparent recently, and of your father when you were 8. 

UnicornyOnTheCob 12:26 AM

I am excited for the opportunity to discuss things, but this message was a bit much for me to respond to all at once. Can we perhaps start over, and address one subject at a time. I must admit I become flustered when my plate gets to full. Also, I think a better format would be email, if you would like to start fresh there?

h0p3 12:31 AM

Yes, it is a great deal to respond to. It would require many conversations and thinking about each others' words. I will stop here. I'm going ask you to wait to respond further me for a while.

> Do you have a guide for setting up tiddlywiki to the extent you did?

I don't. There's plenty of self-documentation, but it's nowhere near a guide. TW is a very flexible tool that fits many contexts, and mine is quite particular. Without knowing your context, my suggestion is to use single-file mode, keep nightly snapshots or version it, and write every day. Do it by hand as much as you can stand.

I'll be happy to answer questions as best I can if you specify your requirements further for me; note, however, that I am, at best, an intermediate user of TW.

> Ah, I see. Who would you say is an expert user of TW or using TW in an interesting way?

The best source of technical experts of TW: https://groups.google.com/g/tiddlywikidev. What consists in expertise beyond that is a different kind of inquiry. What is the tool for? What it means to be virtuous at a practice eventually requires picking out what is salient about the practice in the first place.

Given the default private self-hosted nature of TW, it's extremely difficult to find rich public examples of people using TW in an interesting way (at least to my eyes). I would argue I have one of the more interesting public examples, but I still think of myself as a journeyman.

Hey. Haha, you are the third person who asks about it :) I explained it in one of the comments. Hope it makes sense :) https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/gtziph/an_american_soldier_serving_in_world_war_ii_had/fsfso9h/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Hey, were you able to make the homebrewery in TW5?

Silevence 11:25 PM

ah, i have not- I've been a bit backed up with other projects haha
I've gotten some stuff done to it, like the backgrounds to be the same page color as homebrewery, but i think i was running into trouble with the fonts, idr atm

Jul 15

h0p3 12:02 AM

I hear that. So much to do.

I've had some font troubles myself. 

If you want, you can embed the entire font into the wiki.

Silevence 12:11 AM

I would be lying if I said I knew how to do that haha but anither concern I have is if I give this to the community with it being an embed font I believe the fonts used in homebrewerry are under copyright- so that could get into legal troubles- but I'd have to double check, because tbh I'm not too too sure if thats the cas3 or not.

h0p3 12:17 AM

I can help you with the embedding. I'm not worried about the copyright part myself. If you are able to make it, I would be happy to help you give it away anonymously too.

Silevence 12:27 AM

I'll get back to you on that- because I'll have to look through my tw5 notebooks and see which one it is, I'd appreciate the help, but if the font is copyrighted I'll have to get permission from the creators of it first, sry bout that!

h0p3 1:07 AM

Cool, np.

How many TWs do you have?

I appreciate how spinning many up allows you to have a TW do one thing and do it well. 

I'm a TW geek. I can't say I understand them well enough, but I like seeing what other people make and how they think with them. It's such a special tool.

Silevence 1:14 AM

well atm im using one to make an outline for a webcomic series, i can send you a template of it if youd like to mess with it, but a lot of the ones i have are unfinished and copies of themselves with minor tweaks haha

Hey, I'm an ex-academic (still a scholar though). I would like to know how you take notes. Do you find your ability maps not just onto the physical world but also virtual worlds? What about documents?

meat_popsicle13 3:36 PM

Thanks for your question.  I've learned to be a good listener, so I'm good at dictating and summarizing conversations into note form.  I have to do this at work constantly.  However, I'm doing this for the sake of others who will need my notes.  When No one else needs to see my notes, such as when I was in school, I generally didn't take notes at all.  I would just absorb the images or build relationships in my head based on what was said, then remember them.  I can still remember graphs and images from my undergraduate courses in the early 90's, but not what the professor said.  Regarding virtual worlds, I don't spend much time there, but I do easily remember the landscapes I visit, such as when I ride my indoor bike in the Zwift training world,  I haven't every used that space for my memory, at least not yet.  Documents don't speak much to me, as symbolic language is an always an awkward format for me compared to images.  I write all day long, but it's never intuitive.  Best to you!

h0p3 5:29 PM

Thank you for your answer!

That is fascinating.

Hi

h0p3 10:44 AM

Hey.

What kind of automation do you aim to move toward?

MisstoryCC 10:48 AM

You have tried our app?

h0p3 10:56 AM

I haven't. Can you direct me to place to read about the app?

I'm also interested in the future of the thing, not just what it does right now.

h0p3 11:00 AM

How is privacy handled?

MisstoryCC 7:59 PM

Privacy is the most important thing for this app, most of our users will ask questions about privacy

We have an user agreement, and we also design a tech control system, nobody can see user’s content at all

h0p3 9:20 PM

What user data do you host, and when it is encrypted, so how?

MisstoryCC 9:27 PM

If users are not logged in, no data will be synced to the cloud at all

If you are logged in, the poi data and notes will be synced to the cloud, but photos will not yet(maybe in the future)

h0p3 10:12 PM

Will you make it so that only encrypted data is synced to your servers?

May 21
MisstoryCC 3:39 AM

Yes, all the data already encrypted

We are an experienced team

h0p3 1:08 PM

Cool. Tell me about how it's encrypted.

Hey. =). Freely offering my words, and feel free to ignore them. I am often in awe of your posts. You do amazing work in the TW community. We're all lucky to read your words.

Defiant_Information 8:26 PM

Thank you very much for sharing your words with me. They made my day and made me happy! Thank you so much. TiddlyWiki is amazing and powerful tool and I remember my huge frustration when I was trying to learn how to use it. I even went to the point to hate TiddlyWiki but I also knew that I wouldn't find a better application and always kept coming back to it. So I am more than happy if I can save even a little bit of that initial frustration that I had when I was starting.  It's funny but I can't remember how I made it up to here.

So really, thank you for your words they mean a lot!

h0p3 8:58 PM

Your words scream out to me, nomad. I'm lucky to hear your words even in chat as well. Even though I do not possess your knowledge and skill, I empathize enough with that experience enough to recognize the generosity of your sentiment and praxis. I do not how you made it up there either, but I appreciate it. If you ever want to penpal over wikis with me in the open, hit me up. And, if you need something else, please feel free ask. I'd be lucky to learn from you.

Hello

So how was your experience with psychosis

I creeped out an old lady at the ATM

and accidentally broke the law twice

A third time for jay walking

Life totally sucks with psychosis

I’m always hallucinating and talking to myself and aware of the real world and cannot stop

And it is all shit

ghostheadx9 2:25 PM

My life sucks

I want it to get better

When my MEDS kick in I know it will

Next week is by when

h0p3  3:44 PM

hey, reading and thinking about what you've said now

It sounds like hell, dude. =(

I have been there.

ghostheadx9 3:45 PM

It is hell

h0p3  3:45 PM

Have you taken the meds before?

Do you have any family or friends checking in on you? It can help to make sure to reach out and have IRL people as a lifeline.

You probably already have thought about all this.

So what do you like to do for fun, when you aren't in hell?

To answer your initial question, I experienced psychosis most heavily about 3 years ago.

I had to try several medicines to find something that worked for me.

Psychosis for me was extremely painful. I hated my life, and I could barely see straight.

ghostheadx9 4:20 PM

Right now I am always in hell

h0p3  6:13 PM

what have you done today?

ghostheadx9 8:59 PM

I did some chores and started application process for job and ate that’s it

All day in hell

Brb

ghostheadx9 10:36 PM

h0p3  9:03 AM

I failed to motivate my children to get their work done. Made dinner. Got some reading done. Talked to uncle.

One thing I found useful was writing.

It helped pull me out of a pit

just writing to myself

I really like this tool in particular: https://tiddlywiki.com/

Use an extension to have it autosave for you.

ghostheadx9 9:46 AM

Thanks so much

I have anonymity extensions and don’t want to ruin my browser fingerprint

But I could do it on chrome

h0p3  9:49 AM

Do you really pass tests like this? https://panopticlick.eff.org/

I have only passed it with Tor browser

Even on vanilla installations

ghostheadx9 9:50 AM

I get 20 bits but I am giving off a few fake bits to fake it

So really 17 bits maybe

Good enough right now

h0p3  9:51 AM

I use a separate browser for tiddlywiki as well.

ghostheadx9 9:52 AM

Nice

What does the world think of hacking then?

I feel like hacking is cool but the world looks down on it

h0p3  9:53 AM

I live in Tennessee, most of my neighbors and people I work with don't much care for hacking.

I think it also depends on how you define hacking

I think hacking is about finding the boundaries, understanding the details, trying to satisfy your machine.

Do it because you love it!

ghostheadx9 9:54 AM

Yeah

h0p3  9:54 AM

Because you need it.

ghostheadx9 9:54 AM

True

Not into anonymous though

h0p3  9:54 AM

I can't say I'm much of a hacker, but I learn what I can.

ghostheadx9 9:54 AM

Cool

h0p3  9:54 AM

why's that?

You take steps to anonymize your fingerprint, but you don't care for the organization "Anonymous," right?

(where organization, in this case, is the loosest of terms, I suppose)

ghostheadx9 9:56 AM

People think the majority of hackers are anons. Sick of hearing about anons. Even most grey hats aren’t anons, they are illegal pentesters. I think the Anonymous collective is not really mostly hackers

Mostly script kiddies who don’t know what they are doing

h0p3  9:56 AM

It never has been.

ghostheadx9 9:57 AM

And most don’t get jobs in IT which is when someone would continue hacking for life

h0p3  9:58 AM

Is that a conceptual necessity?

ghostheadx9 9:58 AM

No but...

Honestly generally someone who hacks for life has a job in IT

h0p3  9:58 AM

I consider myself an exception

ghostheadx9 9:58 AM

You hack?

So your a hacker

h0p3  9:59 AM

In 1999, I was kicked out of high school for hacking my board of education. I've been interested in it ever since.

ghostheadx9 10:00 AM

Wow

h0p3  10:00 AM

I wouldn't say I'm some leet hacker by any stretch. I'm not even decent, imho.

ghostheadx9 10:00 AM

I have been a script kiddy forever now

h0p3  10:00 AM

At some level, everyone is a skiddie

that's part of "Trusting trust"

ghostheadx9 10:01 AM

Earning some IT certs and getting back into it soon

Yeah it’s weird

h0p3  10:01 AM

what kinds of projects interest you the most?

ghostheadx9 10:02 AM

Breaking into Reddit and social media, random websites etc

I used to do a little Hack This Site

But grew out of that

But honestly I couldn’t even hack neighbors WiFi at school a while back lol

But you know

Was better at web hacking

h0p3  10:04 AM

If it's WPA2 without WPS, you probably can't get in.

ghostheadx9 10:04 AM

Some people can

I was jumping ahead lol

Brb gotta use bathroom and shower

h0p3  10:10 AM

So, I assume you are Linux or BSD fan. Do you have any distro preferences?

Also, would you care to get off Reddit chat? I've got Keybase, Tox, and XMPP...or you can let me know your preference.
