title: 2022.07.26 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Kickasserole

Woke at 2. Strange dreams. [[TTTOTW]]. Woke my sympaticon, as planned. Drove the SUV to the spot, picked out three nice, small, straight trees already trimmed from the giant brush pile. Strapped 'em to the roof, and went home. [[TTTOTW]]. Sleep again by 4:30?

Woke at 9. Rumination. Gump. [[TTTOTW]]. //Skintime// with my sympaticon. [[Morning Routine]]. [[TTTOTW]]. My daughter slept poorly, but her spirits are up.

A wild [[Noir]] appears...

[[D2]]. //Hyperion// @071:00:00. The poet drives me insane. The runs are going smoother today, and we almost took the dclone at p8, but I didn't want to lose my IG. I should have kept it p1 and stayed out of the fight as my sympaticon solo'd him. She hit 83. Her merc will soon be significantly stronger (though, I may need to just make a Duress for the feller instead). Lots of moving parts to get into order. 

Prepped dinner with my sympaticon. 

Offspring came down to grind. Firejail and bubblewrap projects for them, a break from the other work. Quick dialecture with the whiteboard. They got the gist quickly. Made me happy to see how they approached the problem. Search and documentation out of the gates. [[TTTOTW]].

[[D2]]. More Baal. 

```bash
sudo pacman -S firetools --noconfirm 
```

[[5c0ut]] came down for our meeting. Swapped parking. Played my clarinet. He elected to drop down to prep, and it seems to be less stressful (and hopefully less social*). Picked up another packing inventory, allows earbuds. Lots of interviews. Thinking about school again. [[ASK]] joined us. Chilled. Thought about them peppers. Gonna make an oil.

[[TTTOTW]]. Yet again, for the fuck-if-I-knowth time, giving Matrix a run. Unfortunately, like [[Discord]], so much is locked behind it I can't read. Nearly the same pitfalls. Closer to owning the means of production. Sad to see the [[privacy]] in PM switched to DM.

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. They've handed her social media duty. Daily. Ugh. =(. She is feeling off. Not zombie. Not Milligan. Just so much. One of her projects has been put behind by the others, and even with focusing her resources on it: she may not get it done by the deadline. That is frustrating. //Inform the Men!// Shower of the gods!

Woke my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]].

[[Family Gathering]] was dope. Kielbasa kickasserole. //Stranger Things//. Still feel the horror of it, even while poking holes. [[TTTOTW]].
