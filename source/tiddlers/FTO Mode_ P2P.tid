title: FTO Mode: P2P

//Usually muh homies, often my ingrouped tribe, and definitely my [[T42T]] others. This is a mode toward nodes who have social capital to spend with me. Let us discover, wander, symbolically inscribe, and place tentpegs in the desert. May you, [[Humanity]], enjoy Heaven on Earth.//
