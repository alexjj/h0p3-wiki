title: 2021.02.18 - K: reative Writing & Busywork Papers

"""
How was your week?
Feb 13 5:01pm

Not as busy as usual but somehow more mentally draining haha
Feb 14 12:15pm
How are you doing? I’m FINALLY starting that paper haha
Feb 14 12:15pm
What did you do?
Feb 14 1:01pm
I'm glad to hear the paper has begun!
Feb 14 1:01pm
I'm still curling up, meeting my obligations. I'm going well. Enjoying my time with my wife especially.
Feb 14 1:02pm
I constructed a lesson plan around narrative writing and it was surprisingly hard to get into the proper headspace for haha. Took me four days to get it finished when it was truly an hour at most. But I got some rest in between all of that.
Feb 14 1:04pm
Good! Family time is good. [[L]] and I have been able to spend more time together this weekend too. :)
Feb 14 1:04pm
Dope.
Feb 14 1:04pm
Our desks can feel very isolating at times.
Feb 14 1:04pm
I hear that.
Feb 14 1:05pm
I'm glad you were able to rest and pierce through the block.
Feb 14 1:05pm
Yeah. I built a lesson focused around plotting a story backwards and framing it as a means to learn about our characters from their ending. I feel like it’s an interesting activity for high schoolers haha
Feb 14 1:06pm
No doubt. I wish my English teachers did that.
Feb 14 1:07pm
I was having that conversation with [[L]]  the other day. I remember exactly ONE creative writing assignment during all of high school. That SUCKS lol
Feb 14 1:07pm
That reminds me. I came across one of your poems the other day. I liked it :)
Feb 14 1:08pm
Oh, thank you. I have no idea what I'm doing, lol.
Feb 14 1:08pm
I think one of the problems I see in classes is that there's often such a strong push for a 1-to-1 correspondence between task and evaluation. I was glad to get my students to just write, whether it was for a grade or not.
Feb 14 1:09pm
I'm working on my schizoposting in [[/b/]]. A turn, I hope.
Feb 14 1:10pm
We’re all just faking it til we make it lmao. And yeah, it’s harder to gauge progress on writing since teaching standards just aren’t formed well around it. It’s a frustrating problem in the profession. :/
Feb 14 1:19pm
Nice! Sounds like I’ve got some reading to do :)
Feb 14 1:19pm

I don't love this paper, but it's fine

How are you today?
Feb 18 12:53pm
`/salute`
Feb 18 1:56pm
That will do.
Feb 18 1:56pm
it's good enough lol
Feb 18 1:57pm
What are the practices that solve it?
Feb 18 1:57pm
To my eyes, the fundamental problems cannot be solved in the classroom (though perhaps they can be helped/mitigated to some degree).
Feb 18 1:57pm
No clue! Perhaps that will be part 2. That sounds like a much more interesting paper
Feb 18 1:57pm
'm doing well. Trying To Take Over The World, doing stuff around the house.
Feb 18 1:58pm

❤️
I'm grinding away, gave my schedule a facelift
