title: 2021.05.20 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Sirlin's Beard

[[TTTOTW]]. Chips (yup :P). [[TTTOTW]]. Sleep by 4:30? Trying to make sure I can hear the creation of â››'s, so I aim to pause [[vidya]]s in Kodi rather than mute (could just hotkey Kodi's internal volume, but I am lazy). 

Woke at noon. Meditation. Fireman Time! Cleaning. [[TTTOTW]]. 

Hugs'n'bugs. Grabbed breakfast. Saw my daughter's new artpiece. Clean. Such a strong point of view, imho. When is she going to let her hands go? Will she be the storyteller she wants to be?

//The Walk// with offspring was excellent. People are taking my fruits and candies. Dialectures where I'm doing far less of the talking: much closer to an impromptu seminar. I am being teased mercilessly, but with proof of knowledge wielded ironically. Stick a quarter in me all day please. They are growing even more adept at misdirecting me (since folks did a poor job on their schoolwork otherwise, as is their choice and political right). As usual, politics, morality, and phil of language are key topics we wrestle with. Also, it's clear that people are recognizing us. Stopped to speak with Jessica for a moment (she cute). 

We played simultaneous quasi-silent [[magic]]. My son cheated though, clearly indirectly signaling a mistake that my daughter was going to make. Punishment was severe: I quit his game. =). [[Gradual]]. Praise Sirlin's Beard: we are here to win, losers. We then worked on 5-ish cards a piece for [[The Proxy Cube]]. Their fine-motor skills in crafts are behind. Practice. It's getting harder to select obvious cards. Perhaps we should scour and have a maybe list (just as one does in actual drafting). There is a sense in which we are drafting from the pool of [[magic]] cards entirely and beyond, since a 6th color (Byzantium?) would definitely keep it open-ended and give us the tools we need to evolve the cube without the hassle of restricting ourselves to irrelevant conventions.

Assigned tasks. [[TTTOTW]].

Went to spray the knotweed again, and it's already dying (on the outside, top part)! That's amazing. I'm being just as thorough. I'm worried that kill the top half too fast might actually fail to poison it (but that might be idiotic). This shit lives through fire and busts through concrete. Naw, I'd prefer to know the poison is this effective. 

//The Walk// with mi amor. She did 90% of the talking. I prefer it that way. 

//Skintime// and Assisted Fireman Time! Cleaning. 

[[Family Gathering]] was rich. Hotdogs, salad, and a beer. Not surprisingly, we talked a lot of politics (dark, ofc). Surprisingly, I was the one thinking about changing the topic. Lmao. 

Broski vaped and watched LolVods with me. I'm surprised to see [[2021.05.10 - Anonymous: PKM General]] still running. That is quite rare, imho. I still don't believe they have any idea what they are looking at here; even those who have their PKMs just haven't seen this level of retardation. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time!
