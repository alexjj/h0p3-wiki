Hello!

[[h0p3]] 
3:07 AM

Hey!

Sorry that my writing is not great, not straightforward to read either.

I'm a huge fan of qTox and Session. These are tools that reach me more effectively than Reddit messaging (though I'm happy to speak with you over whatever we can manage).

Can't say that 4chan related subs are terribly empathic, though sometimes there are good eggs in there.

That site I sent you to is like my online diary (a really, really big one, bigger than possibly anyone has ever written before).

in 4 days, the sidebar will be healed, but for now, you can find my timelines here: https://philosopher.life/#Hidden%3A%20Sidebar

I assume a lot of people do not understand what it means to ace (it's something I'm still coming to understand myself).

I'm an extreme neurodivergent person, btw. It takes some time to get to know me.

Here's a youtube video about me that someone else did (never met this person before): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDnd7_lSM3M

[[Variety Creepy]] 
3:15 AM

Hey, it's okay. Don't worry.

I really don't know what qTox and Session are. I'm sorry. But I'm willing to learn more about it. 4chan subs are horrible. You find good people on it but most of them are horrible. I guess the privacy the internet gives when people are online allows them to do anything they want without being judged by anyone.

Oh, okay. I have a diary too but I use a physical book. Glad to know another diary writer!

Yeah, it's hard being ace. Most people have little to no knowledge on us. But it's alright. Oh okay. It's okay to be neurodivergent. I don't mind it

Oh that is a really long video and I don't have enough time for that. I'll watch it sometime later!

[[h0p3]] 
3:29 AM

First 7ish minutes are me* the rest are completely different losers (but just as valid as me).

It's okay about qTox and Session. I admire your willingness.

I spend inordinate amounts of time on my computer, and these two are up 24/7.

I agree that most people who have anonymity (or who wear what Plato called The Ring of Gyges) end up acting very differently than if they didn't have it.

[[Variety Creepy]] 
3:32 AM

Hey, sorry dude. I am not willing to use a chatting forum. Seriously, I don't care if any government spies on me. I don't have anything worth to be spied on.

[[h0p3]] 
3:32 AM

I am confused by your claim. You are using a chatting forum on reddit.

[[Variety Creepy]] 
3:33 AM

Yes but I'm not willing to download a specific app or use a specific website that claims to be super secure or something like that

[[h0p3]] 
3:33 AM

Ah. Well, I will speak with you over what mediums we can.

[[Variety Creepy]] 
3:33 AM

Cool.

[[h0p3]] 
3:33 AM

This can work. Some people do.

[[Variety Creepy]] 
3:34 AM

Yeah, this chat service is good. We can use this

[[h0p3]] 
3:34 AM

I meet a lot of people who aren't willing to switch apps with me. 99/100 times.

[[Variety Creepy]] 
3:34 AM

How old are you?

I do not trust these security apps. Most of them would be lying.

[[h0p3]] 
3:34 AM

My site gives the best description of me (I have Geschwind Syndrome).

I am 35.

Why do you think that?

I am a humble student in this realm.

[[Variety Creepy]] 
3:34 AM

Oh, I'm 17.

[[h0p3]] 
3:34 AM

How about you? How old are you?

Ah, cool.

My daughter is 15, and my son 13.

[[Variety Creepy]] 
3:35 AM

I'm turning 18 in a couple of weeks.

[[h0p3]] 
3:35 AM

Dope.

[[Variety Creepy]] 
3:35 AM

Nice!

[[h0p3]] 
3:35 AM

How will you spend your freedom?

[[Variety Creepy]] 
3:35 AM

I seriously haven't given a thought to it

I might go get a driver's license. Or maybe wait till the pandemic ends. Minimum age over here is 18.

[[h0p3]] 
3:36 AM

That sounds constructive.

Worth taking risks and aiming for mobility, which I know is ridiculously hard to do this in this world at any age.

Will you be able to go to college?

[[Variety Creepy]] 
3:37 AM

Yes, I will.

[[h0p3]] 
3:37 AM

Excellent.

[[Variety Creepy]] 
3:37 AM

Did you go to college?

[[h0p3]] 
3:37 AM

Can you afford to do so, are accepted where you'd like to go? What do you enjoy reading?

Yes. I did. I graduated when I was 19.

I used to teach at Tulane

[[Variety Creepy]] 
3:38 AM

My parents are willing to pay for it. They can pay for it. So yeah, I can afford it

[[h0p3]] 
3:38 AM

Ah. That must be very nice, an extremely rare privilege.

[[Variety Creepy]] 
3:38 AM

Oh nice! Did you graduate high school at 19 or college at 19?

[[h0p3]] 
3:38 AM

College.

[[Variety Creepy]] 
3:39 AM

Whoa!!!

How come? How did you finish 2 years early?

[[h0p3]] 
3:39 AM

I got kicked out of high school at 14.

[[Variety Creepy]] 
3:39 AM

Why?

[[h0p3]] 
3:39 AM

Homeschooled for a bit, but basically went straight into college since my parents weren't going to take the time to teach me.

[[Variety Creepy]] 
3:39 AM

Oh okay.

[[h0p3]] 
3:39 AM

Computer hacking.

[[Variety Creepy]] 
3:40 AM

Oh wow.

[[h0p3]] 
3:40 AM

Long ago. I was a dumb kid.

(still am retarded)

[[Variety Creepy]] 
3:40 AM

That was really dumb. I agree.

Haha, no you're not!

[[h0p3]] 
3:40 AM

XD. Ah, well, you wait until you get to my age. You'll have to laugh at yourself like that sometimes. It's sadly true too often.

So, what subjects do you enjoy reading about?

(I adore reading, but I sadly don't do enough of it)

[[Variety Creepy]] 
3:42 AM

I cringe remember the stuff I did a few years ago. You're right. I don't have to wait that long, haha.

I enjoy a bit of chemistry and physics.

[[h0p3]] 
3:43 AM

Difficult subjects. How's your math?

[[Variety Creepy]] 
3:44 AM

My math is okayish. I like it but I don't put much effort into it.

[[h0p3]] 
3:44 AM

I can appreciate that.

I tell ya, if I had college to do all over again, I would study broadly, and I would even take an extra year if I could. There's so much to learn. Many of my STEM students would have benefited from studying the humanities much further.

It's a transforming experience when done well (though I cannot say most students do it well).

[[Variety Creepy]] 
3:46 AM

I like reading. So, maybe I could read the Humanities during my leisure time?

Would that help?

[[h0p3]] 
3:47 AM

That is crucial, yes. Though, I strongly suggest learning with competent teachers. There's no substitute for having a master.

Physics has a lot of overlap with philosophy (though some aren't happy to agree to that).

[[Variety Creepy]] 
3:48 AM

Even if I want to, I cannot take Humanities on the side. The education curriculum in my country does not allow it.

[[h0p3]] 
3:48 AM

Einstein, for example, is actually trying to give a scientific theory that can speak to Kant's theory of spacetime.

Yikes.

Where do you live?

[[Variety Creepy]] 
3:48 AM

Bangalore, India.

[[h0p3]] 
3:49 AM

Ah. I see.

[[Variety Creepy]] 
3:49 AM

Where do you live?

I agree that physics can overlap with philosophy. In my opinion, anything can!

[[h0p3]] 
3:49 AM

If you are ever in need of any ebooks, audiobooks, software, games, music, movies, let me know, including academic papers.

I live in Connecticut, US

And, you are absolutely correct, philosophy is connected to all subjects.

[[Variety Creepy]] 
3:50 AM

Whoa! Thanks a lot! I have Netflix, Apple Music and Prime Video, so I won't be needing then. Thanks a lot for the rest! They will come handy next year!

Oh nice! The TriState Area

[[h0p3]] 
3:51 AM

In that case, don't be a stranger if you have humanities questions.

Yes. I will do what I can.

It's my honor.

I'm very lucky to know students in the world. You all give me hope.

[[Variety Creepy]] 
3:52 AM

Thanks a lot! I will ask Humanities questions if I ever come across.

[[h0p3]] 
3:52 AM

Good. I will do my best to answer with what I know (which is rarely enough).

[[Variety Creepy]] 
3:52 AM

I'm happy to know that there are professors all over the world who are willing to help students!

[[h0p3]] 
3:53 AM

And, I hope you will reconsider that end-to-end encrypted messaging. The reason you should care about it happens to be a matter of the Humanities.

(though, I'm a long-time computer geek, so I also think the mathematics and practical computing for these tools is also fascinating)

[[Variety Creepy]] 
3:54 AM

I will think about it! I have an exam tomorrow. I'm studying for it. I will read about it and then set it up afterwards.

[[h0p3]] 
3:54 AM

I appreciate your consideration. I know it is expensive to do.

You should study. It's 4am now. I need to log off myself.

TTYL, homie. It's great to meet you.

[[Variety Creepy]] 
3:55 AM

It's 1:25 pm here!

Goodnight!

It was nice meeting you too!
