title: 2021.03.27 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Need Your Squish Mitten

Woke maybe at 2ish. Good ol' rumination and Fireman Time! 

Possibly found the leak and a nifty trick for it. I have a matching threaded cap that fits perfectly. I still anticipate high water bills, but maybe this will help. There's a gunky buildup from at least the washing machine forming. Hrm. I like that I care about this shit. Normally, I would have no sense of ownership or stake in it. 

Hugs with my bro. He's heading back to bed. Hope he sleep hard. Salad and a show for me.

Met a human, henceforth Ren `/wave`, until I know better.<<ref "a">> Fascinating person. Librhul (though I will have to test the metal), been all over the world, multi-lingual, software, digital camps, law professor, non-profits, seems to put their money with their mouth is, a loner perhaps (though social "ept"), obviously insatiable appetite for getting shit done and overloading themselves (hard to have time for a family, I realize).<<ref "i">> They are going to be disappointed in trying to find me anywhere but here, but [[hope]]fully they won't be disappointed in finding my spaghetti. Normally, when people see this monstrosity, that ends it. I suppose it saves us both time. Ren could be different (are you?). They are smart, and I don't think they will find me too intimidating (well, not until we wrestle :P). Hope you like to read and write.

Ranga came down for pets and crack. [[TTTOTW]]. 

Tried galacteek out. Gawjus. I hope IPFS performance continues to improve, and I still want i2pd integration and NAT-piercing mobile-federation (and a cherry on top, huge milkers, and the end of exploitation!). With sufficient effort^^tm^^, can a normie have a set it and forget tool that anonymously syncs a directory or a file that can be accessed in both this tool and a browser hitting WebRTC proxies (needs extensions, but will Google allow it, meh) in 10 minutes? Maybe we're getting there!

Solid sleep. Extended Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. ⁸Δ⁸

Offspring had done their chores. Neat. 

Shopping @ W-Entity for a party-dinner. Pizza, tater tots, ice cream. We saw the ass of an angel. We got fun tasting things today. We only lost each other once.

//The Walk// was tremendous. I need MOAR. If you aren't going to fuck your dog, at least walk him (preferably both, twice a day: get right on that, por favor). We have such different strategies for finding people. I'm sure hers will work, and mine will probably fail. 

[[TTTOTW]].

[[AA]] chatted with me. Catching up. She's recovering. She has too much to do, especially for someone in her circumstances. I'm not of any use to her, but I'll be thinking about it. 

[[Family Gathering]], my wife couldn't eat anything. Period + Shot sucks. I know that my wife's radical physical sensitivity plays a major role in her intelligence (and I wouldn't want her anything less than the genius she is), but it sucks for her that small things can be so overwhelming because they aren't [[phenomenologically]] small at all. Brief chats, bro was a sleep (distant today, locked away in his room more than usual, I think). Offspring and I thought about playing cards, but then we realized that just thinking about the cards is way more fun. My daughter split off into the non-deterministic, ambiguous, player-interpreted narratology of Unhinged style card creation, [[Shadumagick]]. There may be quite a bit to learn here, so I'm excited to see what she does. Proxying and constructing the data files for playing online, finding/making art, etc. Considering asking [[Magnus]] to join us, but not sure it would be his thing (he has a good eye though, so I'd be interested to pick his brain). 4 hours zoomed by in a flash (ugh, gaming bad for you, [[h0p3]], you know you should not do this). It was fun, for the second night in a row, we had a blast.
