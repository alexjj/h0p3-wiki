If you think most people above the age of 25 deserve to live, it's probably because you know, tacitly or explictly, you wouldn't make the real cut. I probably wouldn't either. Let's do our best.

<br>

I appreciate when people vent to me in order to develop a moral response to what they are digesting. Attention vampires hunting for sympathy or [[bias]] confirmation make it harder for those who actually need to openly talk about a story the masses don't want to hear. Non-positivist [[respect]] is rare. 

<br>

In dialectics, pick up to 2: [[shared]] resources, performance, security.

<br>

If your primary motivation is to conserve or liberate your own ego (same thing) at any cost, you're a [[pright]]ist. It makes excellent sense to me why the apparent [[pleft]] cannibalizes, amputates, and cancels. The [[pleft]] barely exists, and, ironically, plenty who actually are wouldn't even identify as such. Class consciousness (to whatever [[dok]]) has permeated enough (the capitalists were always Marxists to some [[dok]], abusing the description) that we all agree to a problem of class. If you aren't searching for prescription and justifying it from a moral basis (a place where Saint Marx himself clearly failed except on a [[Straussian]] reading), you're still playing for the other team.

The way I fight capitalism is through consuming environmentally friendly, idpol-safespaced, fair trade goods and services from employers who are at least marginally less exploitative of some of their employees in the supply chain. Further, how I signal about my consumption is part of how I influence others to be better people too. It's my public service. I'm, like, such a good person when I'm pampered and pandered to.
