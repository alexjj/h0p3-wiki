I'm neither cute nor funny. I have unframed art on the walls, and my mattress is on the floor (just me and [[Mitch]] the Bitch). Basically, as a basement-dweller, I'm a catch, just like my favorite self-described "NPC" (crypto-shadow to the core, my ninja). 

<br>

I wish [[love]] were always as simple as asking them what they want (or even knowing without asking or being asked) and giving it to them. 

<br>

One of the metaethical problems of compatibilism is that it rests upon the assumption that the other is strictly a machine, and there's no decent way to divorce that from objectification which treats the [[other]] as mere means at some level without devolving into the pure undifferentiated relativism of OOO (what is not a mere machine then?). Freewill requires the recognition of: the meaning of the unpredictability of an agent beyond technical impossibility of empirical modeling, beyond problems of whether or not true randomness obtains, and a partially unknown external intrinsic value that isn't in virtue of the problem of representation either. Reductionists who claim to be mere observers in Cartesian theaters may claim they do not have a choice in silencing their skepticism, but in doing so, they treat themselves as mere means as well.

<br>

I wonder if game-theoretic and behavioral definitions of trust as mere predictability fail to capture what it means to come to understand and experience what is almost wholly [[other]], especially with respect to that initial leap of [[faith]] (that never really disappears). I'm not convinced calling these priors clarifies the phenomenon. 

<br>

Even though they aren't as tasty to the pyramid parasites, those without wealth beyond their own human capital can be squeezed harder than those who have the opportunity to shield themselves against exploitation in virtue of their wealth.

<br>

Purposely perpetuated [[power]] inequality is a form of slavery. 

<br>

Merely hating capitalism is not sufficiently justified anti-capitalism (though, it is pretty cool to hate it, dude); even many capitalists hate capitalism at some level. [[Deconstruction Obligates Reconstruction]].

<br>

Product Review: The Human Species. So, I called up the Emergency Economic Computer Karl Center (EECKC), Help Desk Specialist Marx answered, and he troubleshot the problem for me instantly (dude is a genius, swear to hegel). Guis...it's due to capitalism, 😱. He mumbled something about bad jew jews `/shrug`, but then he asked if I had "tried shutting the system down" yet (why didn't I think of that?). How hungry must we be to yeet the rich? I don't predict cooperation won't be torpedoed, nor do I predict the reactionaries I see are going to dispense with mere idpol cannibalization and outrageous happiness theaters, a false conflict to cover up a much greater sin. I wish we knew how to fix this computer together.

<br>

Currently, incentivizing hypermobility and increasing the velocity of human capital may radically decrease the chances that rhizomes can build local roots of trust together, keeping us fragmented, and preventing the representational and bargaining power of organized communities. Can we solve it in hyperspace? In part, we must, as it is a burden ill-suited to meatspace. We must [[represent ourselves|PSM]] in these compressed digital models; there's no way to bridge some gaps at scale or speed without it.

<br>

In the state of nature, beyond family and immediate locals, every outsider's cooperation is fraught with constantly changing, conflicting, and hidden hostilities against and alliances with others. At any point, any person could find themselves canceled, imprisoned, tortured, and killed. Pragmatically, cultures evolved to hodl hospitality norms of welcoming one's guest under one's protection until they've left one's domain of care because cooperative trade is advantageous. There are many blessings to being exempt from blame for a guest's presence too. But, in the 21st century, no one ever absolutely passes away from our contact and sphere of influence, and thus hospitality comes with a more permanent cost. I think we face a massive test of the integrity of our altruistic intention.

How does heavy use of ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱s influence representational drift in our brains? Our evolution could not have prepared us for tools like these, [[Socrates|WWDD]]. Choices and learning best on SSD(?) piriform cortex plasticity. Unpack program, re-run the experience with new correlated and weighted neural pathways in competition for admin r+w+x process rights, abstract/compress mutation, write update to new address (where are the pointers?). Seems like unsafe (in multiple respects) de-duplication, but it's energy efficient to accept multiple kinds of lossiness. I am still not convinced we will be able to reverse engineer the subcomponents (let alone the logical layer) on top of our nonlinear recurrent dynamical system embedded in wet silicon without absurd advances in bioengineering. I predict it will be empirically a blackbox beyond 'merely' the hard problem(s). If at all, I would predict the monopolistic abuse of blackbox bioengineering for centralizing political [[power]] that would lead to a collapse or the impossibility of revolution before we found a solution to this human brain problem. But, I will not deny that price-efficient computing on the order of the human brain (including just using our own :P) is fundamental to solving our crisis of capitalism (far from it). Still a fan of the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱, but I'm [[bias]]ed.
