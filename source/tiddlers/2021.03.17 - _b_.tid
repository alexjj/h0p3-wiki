Sewer slides, the reason I'm mentally ill is that I think too much? Bullshit. I am lucky enough to look back and be grateful to have my retarded brain. I am never wise enough.

Faguette bread, farting on my schmeatballs is disrespectful! Super difficult chest edges, y u m.

I'm solving a vague, ill-defined problem that contains more questions than answers, and it's hard to see how there can be [[good]] answers, much less where to even find them to begin with. I'm listening. Always devouring.

On principle: if you leave me a note in a book, I won't read it. Like torturing animals: I will dog-ear, spine-break, draw animations, scritch dirty graffiti jokes deep into multiple pages, overhighlight, feed mites, and rip through *oops* milk-spilled pages though (I especially like when my thumb leaves a perma-ripple mark on the entire book). Show me your most important books on your shelves first, please. Oh, do you have any blue ones?

Sometimes shaming is an unjustified way of making us accept our status (often a lower one than we deserve in a given value system). To feel shame indicates that you also feel you could be doing better (and, often, that's true, we could, but not always). If you realize that there isnâ€™t much more you actually can do, the shame diminishes, sometimes turns into anger. Unjustified authorities will consistently misuse shame.

I don't think satisfaction extinguishes the passions; that's the point of passions. Apparently, wealth enables one to look toward new identities for expressing one's innermost needs without the material pressures applied to everyone else. At first glance, yet another reason to live in virtual realities.
