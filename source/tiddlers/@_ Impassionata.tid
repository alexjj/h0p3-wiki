I think they [[miss you|https://www.themotte.org/post/94/what-is-your-favorite-motte-post/12045?context=8#context]].

That is extremely high praise, sir. Thank you. You [[said|https://www.reddit.com/r/sorceryofthespectacle/comments/uzxtqf/the_problem_of_real_solidarity/iae2m66/]], "The smart thing to do is catch this upcoming wave as the economy crashes and instrument it with knowledge gained from OWS. I've got a few angles on it." I [[hope]] to learn more in time from you about this. I think you're right.

I regard your network as the best network in existence, by the way. Especially since so many of the sorcerers here have moved on.

You're in a hallucination, not a simulation.

> If the suicidal people leave, then the people who are capable of directing change won't be in the room. 

Sometimes this is correct, my friend. I appreciate the sentiment more than the [[naked]] proposition itself (which requires some cleaning up, except from a rhetorical perspective [one of your great skills, imho]). Perhaps it is mostly those who have been suicidal who tend to really take the time to listen to other suicidal people, especially with their skin in the non-mere game. It can be hard to appreciate properly. I [[hope]] you're feeling alright, sir. It's my honor to read your words, even from a far. If you ever find yourself on the East coast, please let me know. Assuming we can, I'll drive out to see you.

May we prevail against evil together, sir. Never give up! We surrender ourselves to that which is definitionally greater than us both. Let us [[wrestle]] wisely so that we may know and live what matters most together. If it would help, and if you prefer: I'll encrypt [[The Book of Impassionata]]. I've done a poor job of getting to the end (my fault, entirely), and I [[hope]] you will forgive me for failing to draw the fitting portrait (otherwise, I will continue to work toward the end of it). I do see the image of Christ in you, sir. I have [[faith]] in you, especially where I fail.

As I get closer to finishing my first draft of [[The Book of Impassionata]], the more [[grateful]] I become that you've put your skin in the game while [[PSM]]ing about what actually matters. It's hard work, sir. In some respects, I'm usually able to size people up pretty quickly, but that's not easy or fair with your words. I suggest I've read, pondered, and felt your words like few if any ever will. However broken you may be, you're a [[gem]]. It's an honor to [[Find The Other]] in you, sir.

I'm doing well enough, [[thank you|2022.03.17 - Le Reddit Log: SotS Groupchat]]. `/salute`. How about you? Perhaps you should leave [[Discord]] (despite the fascinating server you created). Unfortunately, I think we're all stuck sifting the world for [[salience]] in an inefficient manner. It's hard to improve one's [[S2NR]]. I'm interested in whatever curation advice you may have.

My [trial balloon](https://www.reddit.com/r/MurderedByWords/comments/t1dk6s/louder_with_dumbass/hygkl2e/) on a more popular subreddit has been pretty popular.  

Other than that I'm reflecting on the 'meta' of writing online.  SotS is but one of many localities, and has very little universality across the hyper-local.  If I think of the writing that made an impact in that it was reposted to a lot of places _like_ ours, I think of work like the Xenofeminism Manifesto.  

Written anonymously or pseudo-anonymously, posted on its own domain, shared across the web in a significant number of seed locations and virality does the rest.  

I'm working at an off-reddit site to develop material with some pseudo-free thinkers.  We'll see if that goes anywhere.

If you need [[help]] with this, let me know, please.

[[If any at all, what are some morally justified imperishable, donation-worthy consumables or widely reliable means of production that the poor (1) would eventually use no matter what, and (2) would attempt to save when times are good, that we would predict to be inflation-proof (including hyperinflation or worse)?|Unorthodox Savings]]

Rearranging his innards, he was able to live. I have done my best, sir. I love you. You're often a virtuous Contradiction Handler. I do respect your well-qualified scorched earth policies. We are not here merely to entertain each other, but ideally, we would in many ways. From the rubble, we create ourselves together. Like ghosts, may we haunt them internets. May I always remember and know you, sir. You are a good man. May God bless you, and not merely your heart. God I love you. I love you all.

Yes, sir. Thank you for your response. I appreciate it, and if you need credentials of that kind from me, we can work toward that. This is a relevant [[link]] for us in my html file: https://philosopher.life/#Impassionata. I'm still reading and thinking about your words (and I'm not the only one; [[my offspring|BAGD]], among [[others]], will be [[wrestling]] with every well-measured word you write to us too), trying to develop the best understanding of your [[Public Self-Model]] as I can muster with the resources I have. I will work not to waste your time, especially because I respect the work you do. Also, not that you need it, but, I'm hunting for ways to be useful to you, sir. One way off the bat: I'm in a somewhat unique position to borrow non-digitized Christian texts you may need (if any at all, I do not know), so please don't hesitate to ask. Again, do not feel obligated to [[speak with me|Contact]] (I could imagine you have more important things to do with your time), but I will think carefully when you do.
