Hello there!

I saw your TW on the web and I am intrigued.How do you host it?

Hey there, fireglow! It's great to meet you.

This is likely how you accessed it: https://github.com/m6ram

For the longest time, I've just run my own server, but since I don't own anything in the datacenters for real, I've decided to just use github. 

One of my goals is to self-host as much of my infrastructure as I reasonably can. 

Since my ISP prevents me from hosting, I'm reliant upon distributing on the web on infrastructure that I don't own. It's read-only for everyone else.

My [[Root Users]], however, can VPN in my network or simply have read+write file sync access. That's the real hosting work, imho.

You don't happen to be the /g/entooman I met recently, eh?

This is also still roughly accurate: https://philosopher.life/#RGM

Heyy, thanks for the reply! 

Oh, interesting. So you edit the TW locally and send it to github? Is that process automated?I read about TW last year or so and found the idea of the self-contained wiki/site fascinating.

ah, [[RGM]] is helpful

Not a problem. I'm happy to help you set it up. In many respects, I'm an intermediate user of TW at best.*

The pilot's seat is local, on my network. I use TW5-Bob to make it so I can have multiple synchronized tabs on multiple devices accessing the same wiki simultaneously.

Pushing to github is automated. Every minute. 

Those who wish to capture every edit of a day can do so, and each night I take a snapshot and reset for the day. It's a compromise. 

TW is far from perfect. It is the best tool I've found given my requirements.

Hmm, interesting

The self-contained, quine-like nature of TW is something special. I hate JS, but TW-WASM isn't coming out for a long time, imho.

Do you have a git repo locally for it?

Yes.

cool stuff

I'

I'm just finding out all the stuff TW can do

https://tiddlywiki.com/static/Saving%2520to%2520a%2520Git%2520service.html this?

This is something they added after I set my [[RGM]] up. That is not how I do it, but I've met many who do it that way.

Interesting!

Hmm.

Am I mistaken or did you mention some TW-to-TW messaging on your blog?

Like I believe on your contact page you said something like "TW is my primary choice", what do you mean by that?

Yes, I speak to people from my ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱, and some use their sites to speak with me, in the open. [[Find The Others]] has some examples. [[kickscondor]], [[Sphygmus]], and [[chameleon]] are my favorite interlocutors who engage in this practice with me. I'm very [[lucky]] to know them.

It is also possible to synchronize files between wikis, to maintain a subset of tiddlers or a subwiki (of a kind) with each other. My daughter, [[j3d1h]], and I had worked on this with Ratox and Resilio Sync, previously. The hacker who builds TW5-Bob also has considered this domain some, to my understanding.

I prefer that people speak to me in context, using a medium they control. The difference in the [[hyperconversations]] between those who are autonomous and own the means of production vs. those who do not is considerable.

Some of my letter-writing lasts for hundreds of pages, and it is deeply linked/mapped onto the rest of our work.

The filesync is interesting. What is ratox?

Some things are best communicated real time via something like an instant messenger, but there are some kinds of communications that need to be non-linear and long-form. Beyond what I owe to [[others]], the relationships that matter most to me require an [[intimacy]] that takes years to build. This is why I prefer TW (or other indieweb like tooling).

Hm yes I agree.

https://philosopher.life/#Ratox

I'm not sure how best to describe it. I am a novice in many respects. I would describe it as the Tox library implemented in an application meant for piping in POSIX compliant systems. 

aah right, tox

Interesting

Please forgive me, I have a [[plumbing problem|Polymath Craftsman]] that must be fixed or [[my wife]] and brother ([[AIR]]) will be unhappy. I work hard to respond to all messages, and I am [[grateful]] to be able to speak asynchronously. Please feel free to leave messages and continue the conversation. It's my honor to meet [[you|fireglow]].

sure, sorry, I was also being afk, the cats wanted attention 

I hope everything is well with your plumbing =)

Immediate problem fixed. 

I have two cats. Ranganathan and Chairman Meow. [[Kitty Kat Korner]]

Meow, indeed!
