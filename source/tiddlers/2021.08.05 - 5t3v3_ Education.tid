Alright, so I’ve slept on it, and believe it or not that did nothing to magically organize the internal turmoil that’s been going on for months, lol

Tough I do have a few questions to ask

In general, do you have any advice? I know that it’s kinda vague, but I guess I’ve only really been advised the commonsense stuff, (e.g don’t miss lectures, don’t fall behind in coursework, build a social network, etc)

Yo.

I am not surprised that turmoil wasn't magically solved overnight, just like you. There's a lot to try to understand, and not everything is up to us. I don't know what your feeling and why, though I have my guesses.

You're obviously intelligent and knowledgeable. I hold autodidacts in very high regard. 

You may fall into some of the classic tropes and experiences of people in your shoes (and, you aren't alone). I don't know. 

I don't think your question is a bad one at all. 

It is my opinion that if you want to pass your classes, meet your professors consistently in their office hours to pick their brains, build relationships with people who are on some similar walks of life, you can do it. You got what it takes. 

I don't have any particular hacks for you that you won't already have considered: that's my bet. 

Why do you want to go to school?

I think once you know that you want to go to school and know why, you're gonna do just fine. And, from what I can gather, you have some excellent critical reasons to doubt the value of the process that leads to your acquisition of a piece of paper that signals you're one step closer to entering a society you might not care much for in the end. Correct me if I'm wrong, please. 

You are correct, I've been having lots of conflicting feelings whether or not I should put myself into debt for a piece of paper

I guess I don't really know any other way to climb up the meritocracy though, and college is the classic way to gain some chance at socioeconomic mobility

Ideally i'd be going to learn, but you know how it is

It's not a meritocracy, but I will agree that it grants some measure of mobility.

I cannot offer you certainty. There is only risk any way we turn. 

Learning is almost its own end. 

Yeah, I suppose I just hope it is, and only see the world through the rose tinted glasses that tells me society is actually meritocratic

You face exploitation. I think the best you can do sometimes is figure out how to avoid it and how to prevent it for others.

I think you'd enjoy college immensely, btw. When you stop giving a fuck about getting the A, and instead it's about transforming yourself, practicing being human with others in a classroom, committing to participating in a jointly told story, you'd have a lot to contribute (and, I'm sure plenty of it will be painful too). 

I don't know how to help you become happy in the end. Justification and contentment are usually all we can achieve under non-ideal circumstances.

If mobility is all you really need, I'd become a welder or electrician, highly certified, union. You'll be in high demand until your body cannot take it, and even then, your expertise will be worth something. 

That which can be remoted will be increasingly outsourced to those who have the lowest cost of living to maximize the capitalist's competitive advantage.

You can't outsource or automate away a very skilled tradesperson's job.

College and a trade make good sense. My brother, [[JRE]], has done this. I think it has served him quite well.

Yeah trade school is always an option, though I don't know if I'd actually like the job

I don't know if it'd actually like the jobs I would get with a college degree, but at least I'd like the topic/field as a whole

Finding a justifiable job with which you would be content seems a worthy standard. Happiness is another problem altogether, and you can't afford to be locked down by uncertainty. You only have one life. 

Another thing about college, is I think would have to give a fuck about getting the As, their "financial aid" is practically useless, and the potential at getting some sort of grant/scholarship may be the only way I could realistically finish the degree. I don't know if I'm 'A' level student though.

That makes sense. I suppose I mean to say that getting good grades, seeking the approval of your teachers - these aren't sufficient. I suggest that if you pour yourself into it, you'll achieve these in addition to what you'd really be there for (beyond mobility). 

You know I failed classes in middle school. I was kicked out of high school.

damn

Once I wanted it though, I went for it. And, it took me a while to realize why I was there (and, note, of course, that I also left). 

How was your experience getting accepted into college?

My donors attempted to homeschool, lazily, with creationist, evangelical fundie curriculum (despite being extraordinarily educated themselves). It didn't work. I eventually was enrolled in community college, and then eventually applied to Berea. It was the only school I applied to. I only applied to 5 MAs (it's all I could afford), and I only applied to 1 PhD program (since I was legally bound to live in that area). I have won many, many lotteries.

Study your ACT/SAT and hunt for funding. Make it your 8-hour a day job, with your minimum wage hustles. It's the best chance you have to go for free.

(Berea College, btw, is a school where everyone who is allowed to attend goes for free)

(250 hours is the bare minimum study for those exams, btw)

Can you take them outside of high school?

All of them are outside of high school. The institutions which own and run these testing processes are independent. 

You can take them at any age. 

You should look at in-state options, as you may have better luck this way.

I think it's worth saving and spending 1-2k to apply. 

Note that even if your tuition is fully paid, you might still have to go into some debt.

I've only looked in-state, no way I could afford out of state

I have my opinions about this, but it is not my place to advise you there.

(if your scores are high enough, you should be applying to many schools, some of them out-of-state)

You can also go the community college route. It is not as good as flagship state university in many cases. However, it is far better than nothing, especially if you are motivated and there to learn.

Again, my recommendation is to have both a college education and a trade. This is what I'm begging my own offspring to do. 

For your children, (if they decide to go) how did you plan things like finances and stuff like that? I've heard it can be harder for home schooled students

I've been a high school teacher. I've worked in admission offices (my wife as well). Nobody cares about your high school grades. They are meaningless. Inflated into oblivion. I have had principals force me to pass students (allowing them to graduate high school) who couldn't even read a paragraph out loud, couldn't multiply, couldn't pass 4th grade on merit. 

Homeschoolers are well-represented across the board, and statistically out-perform public and private school students. 

The test score is the closest thing to an objective standard the university will have. Your essays, extra-curriculars, letters of recommendation, and other soft or qualitative sides are important too.

I wonder how much has changed now that most have test optional admissions due to covid

We are very lucky that my wife works at Yale. They will pay enough for my offspring to at least attend community college for free. If my offspring decided to do their best (and, they will read this sentence, and they have heard this many times): they could attend any school they wanted. 

There are many reasons that testing is disappearing. The top end schools are doing it to maximize legacy and aristocratic ladder entry. 

Projections are that 25% of post-secondary schools in the US are closing in the next decade (and that was before covid hit). The landscape is in crisis as it has been hollowed. Given that the state puts students into indentured servitude, administration costs have ballooned everywhere to soak up the "free" money. Many are turning into "for profit."

You mean official taxable 'for profit', or their current 'non-profit', with 1$ billion + endowment 'for profit'?  lol

Non-profit in name, the endowment is not what worries me the most. These institutions are being hollowed out and redesigned by and for capitalists. The infection runs deep and wide.

Yeah I agree, they are deteriorating across the board in my opinion

More and more it is about the piece of paper, backed by an institution with history, than it is about the education.

For them, yes. It need not be the case for you.

I'm a little worried though, I read a Gallop poll the other day about how a majority of college students don't actually gain any critical thinking skills.

And it's hard to actually do the type of challenging work that makes a person learn while maintain good grades

Most are not transformed by the experience. Diploma mills stamping people with status. It is still their choice. Your teachers will be able to assist you in actually learning more than what the class requires.

Several majors are notorious for teaching you nothing. Communications, Business, Education. 

You can still improve your critical thinking skills in school, but it is more self-directed, and has more to do with your motivations than theirs. 

how about CS(my currently intended major)?

They'll pass you even if you didn't acquire what it purports to be all about. 

It's a fine major. Make sure your discrete math and probability are better than required. Nothing beats getting your hands dirty, actually programming. Getting your foot in the door is hard. 

I lucked into my first programming job. Talked about automating my WoW accounts to farm. 

really? nice

If you can afford to double major, I think a Humanities major is worth your time. Philosophy, Economics, History, Polisci are my preferences. 

I wish I could double major

You may also want to consider Electric Engineering instead of CS. 

Would be Electric Engineering be the hardware of the computer chips, or something else? I can't say I know much about the field.

I've done some simple stuff with an FPGA, but seems awfully more complicated than software based programming

I think EE would prepare you to be an excellent programmer.

I suggest it will open more doors.

I think you already have a taste for it too. =)

Note that engineering programs are competitive, and they aim to weed people out in the first year. You'll work harder than you probably ever have to survive.

You'll have fewer electives, and it will be far more structured. I have problems with this, but I will admit that EE's make good programmers.

Yeah, I've heard that engineering is  one of the most intensive programs

(see, I've not really told you much you didn't already know :P)

I wish I could meet with the department head/dean or whatever they are called for stuff like. Current lead times for an appointment are 1-2 months

Yikes. =/. 

I don't have enough knowledge to help you navigate the Covid landscape. I'm out of the game. My wife doesn't handle undergrad at all. 

Yeah, this is the first semester where students couldn't defer while listing covid as a reason. I've heard they are overwhelmed with the influx of students

They need the money.

indeed, as much as a hate high tuition, I understand they still need to pay faculty.

That's not why tuition is high, but I agree they need to pay their faculty.

is it not one of their biggest expenses? 

Depends on the school.

I assumed that's while so many of the professors don't have tenure

75% of the courses most people encounter are taught by those making below minimum wage.

Also, complete tangent, but speaking of the dark side: https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life

oh no

I was recently considering using iCloud recently, due to it's nice UI and in-general better privacy by Apple

guess that's plans out the window

Before we get too far off, If you had to give a yes or no answer, is university still worth it with the record high tuition?

You've asked for my opinion. I offer it freely. If you think that the real value of your education has a dollar amount attached to it, then no. Anyone who argues that school is only "worth it" for the sake of making money either have never had a real education or are being malicious reactionaries. 

An expert can take an average person up two standard deviations in mastery of a discipline. There are no shortcuts to this. Learning entirely on your own will always be worse than having a real teacher. 

What is learning for?

Many have been brainwashed into thinking it's to be useful to a market, as though that is what will bring meaning, peace, certainty, and even joy to their lives. 

But, if you are asking what's the fastest, most reliable route to social mobility, if you aren't literally networking with the wealthy at these schools, then you have better options outside of school to just make money.

Now, if the question is whether or not you'll enjoy the other routes, I do not know. As I said, however, I cannot offer you happiness or safety. I think that is misguided, failing to appreciate the real problems your generation is facing. 

Were I in your shoes, I wouldn't give a fuck about the debt. I'd go to school.

Nobody can ever take that capital from you.

(well, unless they damage your brain :P)

See, they don't call me [[h0p3]] for nothing!

Thanks, you've really helped ease some of the turmoil I've been facing. 

It's my honor, sir.
