title: Give Me A Hint

//Unfortunately, we will never know just how many of these whooshes exist for each of we autists. Best part is that the same events can transpire multiple times in one's life and we won't learn our lesson (and, yes, I'm proud of that generalization, tyvm). We are special.//

* "Would you like to get some coffee?...Okay. How about lunch?"
* `/puts my hand on her tit` "I'm cold."
* `/invites me to scary movie, holds my hand during` "You have strong arms."
