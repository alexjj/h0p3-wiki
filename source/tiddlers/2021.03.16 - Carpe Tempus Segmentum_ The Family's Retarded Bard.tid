title: 2021.03.16 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: The Family's Retarded Bard

[[TTTOTW]]. Been a while since I looked at DAGs. 

Pizza with my bro. Best $4 pizza I've ever had. Anchovies, goat cheese, olives. Thank you robots of capitalism. Bro's teaching his retard about his work. So much thought goes into what he does. We wandered quite a bit.

Fireman Time!, [[TTTOTW]], and //Being Erica// for my wife (cannot even [and, after speaking with her, I'm not convinced she's in love with it either, just passing the time without expending energy]). She has more energy today! Triple Vitamin D. Plague of the 21st century 1st world, and even Gout is on the rise. 

Slept hard, woke late. Pressures on my head. Rumination. Fireman Time! Vapelyfe. [[TTTOTW]]. [[Morning Routine]]. Hugs'n'bugs. DMV scheduling is even worse. Nope.

Bro was feeling a random sense of dread, that terrible anxiety. We hugged and chilled. 

//Skintime// conversion, Inform the Men! Rumination after, no shower for me. Continue to race in my head a lot. The differences between what I can write, what I can speak, and what I think are huge. I'm always having to filter, prune, compress to fit a context. 

Helped my wife make her pumpkin and pecan pies. Apparently, we sound like a really old couple together. Baking with my wife is a blast because (a) I get to fuck with her the entire time like the retard I am, (2) there is an even higher than normal rate of opportunities to speak the mind of a lecher in this culinary science, (c) it's stupid fucking delicious.

Assign~~s~~ments,<<ref "a">> tandem work for offspring. C'mon, you can do it!

[[Family Gathering]] was cool. I do not have a name for the soup/stew we had; it was custom craft over 20 hours, one meal evolving into another.<<ref "k">> It was a bright and multi-flavored (feels I can't even pick out what continent it belongs on, which is neat) corned beef and noodle soup where the brothy part (I think) was made from, oh shit, I forget the name already, a fancy word for half onion, quarter celery, quarter carrot, Itellyawhat (ah, Mirepoix, gracias search engine). Banana Bread she made earlier (and the experiment worked!) rounded out the meal. My cooking makes us sad now, lol.

The [[Magic]] Squad assembled. In this corner, there was [[j3d1h]] with her pile, and in that corner, [[Scout]] with his, and that match ended I don't know how because I was sucked through a vortex into an arena with my son (hard to pay attention to multiple games at some level).<<ref "t">> I wish I recorded the match, a battle royale. Culling Scales moment with giggles, and I had to go take a shit; I played from the shitter (he'd call it out). Maybe I need to start taking notes with him about these now (it's hard to remember all the relevant game states in a match as it is, but with singleton cubedrafted decks, everything is too unique for me to remember the story [this, son, is perhaps where we must be exceptionally diligent in our notetaking {it's key to find objectively worthy things to take notes about, [[WINTCIS]]}). G1 he has SFM T2, and I can't squeeze through 3 pieces of removal with a hand of bombs that would have played ball if he didn't have a T3 Batterskull (absurd in this format). I got fucking curbstomped with a great hand. G2, Elspeth and Meloku while I drop more bombs than he can (roughly speaking). G3 was the closest match (took an hour). The difference was that he had Capsize + D&T to my very heavy mass removal.

Nasty AF, pure gas mixture of ramped answer and must-answer, multiple routes to burn mana at any post-t3 stage of the game, screams inevitability, right? He still took a game off me. Ridiculous. None of his errors have been particularly egregious, but I can't say I should have won my games. Twice he guessed what was in my hand without enough information to reasonably guess, and correctly each time. Once, however, it was because he saw me flash part of  card, unknowingly (I'm not being careful enough - I'm usually much better about it in practice [he wasn't either, as his sister was pointing out to me {yes, I'm going to look, loser :P}]). It's obvious that his mastery of MUC is coming out (and, I hope he will appreciate why not to build MUC here). Particularly delicious play as he kept capsizing fetter's to hit the newest best, onto disk, he taps out end step (with skull in play), I repeal and pop (though with a Bribery onto Witness before scooping).

Nap in her lap. She turned down another massage. Need to nail that earlier. She doesn't like having oil on her without showering after, paranoid.

Fireman Time!...

<<footnotes "k" "Our kitchen looks and feels different with my brother's continued work. He's really good at this. We've talked about other things he could do for a living over the years, but it's hard to beat earned and innate artistic talent that you can practice almost anywhere. He's qualified on paper and in practice, perhaps one of the few radically utilitarian arts. The only part of the show he's never run has been the legal and business social side. Long-term, 10 years from now, he should run the entire show. It's a {[[Dream]]} I'm convinced can happen (and I've seen the failure rates in the market). But, moral business is hard to run. That is my job to help try figure out now.">>
