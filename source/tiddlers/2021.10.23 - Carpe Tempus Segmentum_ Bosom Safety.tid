title: 2021.10.23 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Bosom Safety

Added something absolutely critical to [[Wiki: HTML Metatags & robots.txt]]. Can't say I'm going to keep it. It's real bad, even eating away into i3 tabs. [[TTTOTW]]. She's up still. Wat!? Lol. Listening to voice trainers and more talk about Disturbed's SoS cover and Cash's Hurt cover, first impressions from them. Tears on the screen and on my face of course. The songs are too much. [[TTTOTW]].

Sleep by 3? Woke at 10? [[ASK]]ing. More black and white. A very expensive time. I cannot say I understand her pressures well enough. 

[[1uxb0x]] has been dealing with two clogs this morning in the kitchen. Reading manuals, searching the interwebs, and busting out our tools. One down, one to go. I'm gonna shop for whatever he needs.

//Skintime// trying to put her to sleep, but she can't. Silly. Downstairs instead. //Inform the Men!//<<ref "m">> Well, my day has been outstanding. I need 2 or 3 more of those today (I am DT shaking with horniness), `/beg`, please (but I can't, for multiple reasons, including that my retard looks like a zebra with flayed stripes of skin missing). Shower of the gods! Chili and chips. [[TTTOTW]]. She came down again.

Tears, listening to The Sound of [[Silence]] again. Also, my wife found [[this|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ew_bfFvros]] acapella appalachian-didgeridoo-viking-bayou wigger folksong (`/raises hand`) that blows my mind.<<ref "s">> Fusion with clarity and precision. And, that might be the best beatboxer I've ever encountered (I reserve the right to doubt here; I'm not convinced it's real still). Broke my [[Reply Mode]] to send it to [[T-Money]], as I knew it was worthy and cost us nothing.

//Midnight Mass//, couldn't stay awake, but //Raw Skintime// was what I really wanted. Keep her mind occupied so I can dive into flesh. Dadnap in the safety of bosom.

[[JRE]] woke me, and I figured out that [[m16]] had been muted (by mi amor) too late. We did the phone thing, and different technical difficulties arose (this time, he had a hard time hearing me). He blew up a pump today, on-call. Thinking about the morality of FU money, safety, Hasan Piker's expensive house, drawing limits to our selfishness, and inspecting our moral intuitions. Chats after.

Made pizza with the offspring, and we shot the shit (my daughter was in an excellent mood). I had 4 shots of rum and a beer with my pizza while watching LoLWorlds. Sleep by midnight.
