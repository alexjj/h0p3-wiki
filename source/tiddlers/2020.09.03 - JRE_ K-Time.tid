You should feel free to use the accounts for WoW if you want em

Friend recommended The Talos Principle to me. You might like it.

Aug 21 5:15pm
Do you have any invite on myanon?
Aug 21 5:44pm
Mine disappeared.
Aug 21 5:44pm
Would like to invite a friend.
Aug 21 5:44pm
I have no invites either, funky, never used them

Court went well, judged ruled from the bench, 30 min in, took away parent's rights and said they only have 30 days to appeal.  They didn't show up to the zoom meeting and have been unreachable for a long time
Aug 28 10:37am
Wow.
Aug 28 1:59pm
Seems like it could be smooth sailing here.

How goes it?
Fri 10:20am
Slow and steady
Fri 2:12pm
How do you not eat endlessly while in bliss?
Fri 2:13pm
I feel like I eat a lot.
Fri 2:22pm
I need to walk when I'm on bliss. I rabbithole. No time to eat in those cases.
Fri 2:22pm
Slow and steady sounds solid.
Fri 2:23pm
How late are you up now a days?
Fri 2:25pm
Trying to fix it. 2am last night, but I'm only getting a few hours.
Fri 2:25pm
Ouch
Fri 2:25pm
Brain is going haywire.
Fri 2:25pm
I'm 2am everynight, but sleep till 830-930
Fri 2:26pm
I am lucky that everyone else in the house is stable and doing well. They don't need to depend on me.
Fri 2:26pm
K time?
Fri 2:26pm
That's still not enough sleep, but that is survivable.
Fri 2:26pm

[[JRE]]
K time?
Uh, what do you mean?
Fri 2:27pm
My [[CTS]] logs give the times, btw.
Fri 2:27pm
[[AIR]] and I discussed it awhile back, we would both try ket again someday, but I know it's hard to do weekly
Fri 2:28pm
Ah.
Fri 2:28pm
No, I'm not convinced it's K-time yet. I'm going to eat the depression and anxiety if everyone around me is doing well for now. The moment my problems become their problems is when I don't have a right to my mind.
Fri 2:29pm
I still feel like my reactions are within the realm of sanity given what I see.
Fri 2:29pm
Want me to mail you both some asap?
Fri 2:30pm
I will think about it, chat with [[AIR]] and see if he wants to take turns watching for each other someday
Fri 2:31pm
Cts title about covid and maga rallies made me lol for real
Fri 2:32pm
hehe
Fri 2:32pm
What time are you aiming to actually go to bed?  Perhaps I can call you for a little bit when I get bliss sometime soon
Fri 2:33pm
Dont want to add to the problem
Fri 2:33pm
I don't have a bed time that makes sense. haha. I have to read and write sometimes, regardless of the time. When I have the will, lol. Anytime before 2am is my preference.
Fri 2:36pm
I wish k-time didn't cost so much emotionally
Fri 2:36pm
Gonna try to give kiddo a nap, afp
Fri 2:36pm
I am not sure K would fix this. I don't feel hopeless, and I'm not feeling suicidal.
Fri 2:37pm
Oh
Fri 2:37pm
I simply haven't had a stable sleep schedule in a very long time.
Fri 2:37pm
Part of being crazy, I think.
Fri 2:38pm
Well, that is good, but also problematic since it means a new problem is becoming  invasive
Fri 2:38pm
I think if anyone can get a good night sleep at this moment in time, it means they might have been asleep before they laid down
Fri 2:39pm
jahaha
Fri 2:39pm
Yeah. I think that's fair to say.
Fri 2:39pm
Get woke son!
Fri 2:40pm
We woke tho
Fri 2:40pm
Lol
