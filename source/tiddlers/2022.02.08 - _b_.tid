Guessing: On average, long-term total demand curves may not be higher than pre-covid, but confidence in the market is lower, hence some artificial spikes in demand. Qua the bullwhip effect given post-JIT manufacturers' new hoarding, perhaps we should anticipate a partial collapse in demand. Ironically, the short-sighted off-loading of demand risk on suppliers only grows. While futures may shore up some uncertainties by hedging exposure and providing speculators price discovery opportunities with skin in the game signaling for the other speculators, they don't solve the risk the rest of us experience. Doesn't seem like there's a graceful way out of this one. If there is an end to the cycle, I don't predict it will be in virtue of people learning from history.

One of the ironies of my life is that I tend to know someone else long before they know me, despite all the footholds and material I give them to make the opposite true.

A standard mimesis: P1 says to P2, "hold this and you'll be happy." P2 does. Sometime later, P2 says to P3, "hold this and you'll be happy."

nothing works and no one knows why in theory or practice

Almost every kid who grew up in a semi-stable moderately religious household thinks theyâ€™re a nihilist. Predictable (not fundamentally problematic*), especially if they never felt religious while still having been forced to go through the ritual motions. It's sometimes all too easy to find people following the standard trope reactions. I am honored to know the [[wrestlers|wrestle]] I do. It is no small task.
