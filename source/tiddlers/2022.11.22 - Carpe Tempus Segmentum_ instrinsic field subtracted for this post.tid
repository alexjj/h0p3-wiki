title: 2022.11.22 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: instrinsic field subtracted for this post

[[TTTOTW]] + //House of the Dragon//. autoremove-torrents is dope (surprising how many clients are supported), much slicker than other things I've used in the past. Limiting retention to what is actually used, except textbooks, and then by freespace requirements. This could easily be retailored for racing, should we ever be so [[lucky]].

Sleep by 7:30?

Woke at 1:30? Solid. Gumpination. Meditation. [[TTTOTW]]. Hugs'n'bugs.

Offspring came down to grind. Cleaning. [[Ignota]] chat. [[TTTOTW]].

//The Walk// with mi amor. Clarinet. We encountered Maneece, a Haitian woman, her son owns a very large house. Baptist. The second story like it on that circle. Talked for 15 minutes? She invited us over for Thanksgiving for her Haitian meal. Carded. `/wave`. 

New experience: i3 session logged out, no input from me. `/headscratch`. Logs show possible problem with having too many files open (and, even if that isn't the problem, it is a problem I should've fixed long ago). One day, I will actually know how to use my computer. `/nod`.

```
# /etc/security/limits.conf

*           soft    core       0           # Prevent corefiles from being generated by default.
*           hard    core       unlimited   # Allow corefiles to be temporarily enabled.

root        hard    nice       -20         # Allows root to run a process at minimal niceness to fix the system when unresponsive.

root        hard    nproc      65536       # Prevent root from not being able to launch enough processes - this line must come after 
                                           # global limit line in this file
```

```bash
lsof -n 2>/dev/null | awk '{print $1 " (PID " $2 ")"}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -25
```

With a 65535 hard limit?

```
 366213 MuWire (PID 4172)
 158339 eiskaltdc (PID 4176)
 125866 firefox (PID 8724)
  23800 kodi.bin (PID 3867)
  16920 chromium (PID 2636)
  11222 WebExtens (PID 8983)
  10168 Isolated (PID 9603)
```

These aren't systemd-based processes. That does it for [[MuWire]]; it's over. Fek. Screentearing on chromium and terminator as well. Picom doesn't help. nvidia-settings don't either. My beloved loonix.

[[Family Gathering]] was delicious. Brats and potatoes, water. We had chocolate too. //Mr. Robot//. Show is filled with crazy people.

Bugged mi amor before her thing. Lots to do tomorrow. She doesn't have a seat that is really comfortable for her. We can't give up. 

Tried podman-desktop out again. I could imagine that tool eventually evolving to be where I interacted with my containers, CLI and GUI. Ginger ale and [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! Sleep by 10?
