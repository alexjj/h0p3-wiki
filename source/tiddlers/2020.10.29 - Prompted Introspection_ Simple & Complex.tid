title: 2020.10.29 - Prompted Introspection: Simple & Complex

!! Write briefly about one thing in your life that is simple and one thing that is complex.

I think the simplest things are sometimes those that have significant chunks or parts that are obviously outside of my control. Breathing is something I need to do most of the time. //**manual breathing**// and holding my breath is still up to me in many cases, but generally it's automated. I have asthma and allergies, and I'm aware of my breathing throughout the day usually because I smell something, or my breathe smells/tastes bad, meditation, intensifying a moment of pleasure, waiting for a blow of some kind, or even anxiety reminds me of it too. Most of the time, it's pretty simple there too. It's filtered out usually, but it bubbles up into my awareness. Hell, it even wakes me up too (apnea). 

Complex things in my life often require huge amounts of energy and time to experience. Aiming to [[Be A Good Dad]] is an example of a very complex [[Project]] and {[[Axiom]]} in my life. It's the kind of thing that influences almost everything in my life (I'm not sure what isn't affected). It's not easy to model well about it. It's draining, especially the way in which I do it. Chaos might be a better word here.
