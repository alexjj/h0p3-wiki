[10:47:57] Tapeda: I find with the culture's we have today, there's a little block missing somewhere deep in the chain, one which we all still bleed, in and by the name of the beast,
shall we focus, structure, form our realities as we so see fit, however gratuitious, however indulgent, and carefully cried the nights in where we dance against our life.
[10:48:03] Tapeda: As from where i sit, and find your reply to be so relatable to a point that I am humbled to even attempt to write direct commentary, as the vision of the child behind the eyes of, every
one, and each of the adulting scrabblers I meet is exactly the block of greatness and infinity(going between pretend worlds in the space of all possible rule) I find so lacking
as i expand my ground-truth on history of the now, and the streams eminating from the sources that may just create the new(Carmack, Thiel(and his oh so successful fellowship), em'all).

[10:48:09] Tapeda: So without getting lost in the weeds of all the great reference made in your replies, and maybe parts you find interesting in mine, Let me attempt to push to an odd, yet quiet,
but strong place for discussion. For a very long time i wanted to change the world, I crafted so many godly creations of my mind, finely knit fragile ideals where i would only
need but to press a button in its center for all to be good once again.. I later came to the realization that really changing yourself is an easier task with much greater payoffs
than any grand-scheme of keeping a consistent narrative truth everywhere in the world... But we stand at a crossroads for the humanities reality, said the joker to the thief, Or should
I say Thiel, who's kept his fellowship of scoundrels in great care very akin the the witcher 3's King of Thieves in novigrad if that rings any bells.
[10:48:15] Tapeda: This interview fascinated me recently; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkLj805hIPQ&ab_channel=HooverInstitution
Seems to come in contact with what i would classify as something of a sort in genuine patriotism, by which meddling with charachter is the true and perhaps only hill to die upon.
[10:48:27] Tapeda: 
With our great meaning crisis' that seems to have yet hit with its full force(lighting,thunder require time, yada yada).
I'm afraid the act of teaching meaningful (god-ly/esque?) sensibilites of patriotism, and individual charachter through a public education has been egregiously eroded.
(Applying also to European culture that seems to have replaced patriotism, and god with shrowds of careful guilt-tripping(which I'd also love to dive into deeper it has any intrigue to you)).
[10:48:45] Tapeda: .
.
What if climate change on our individual planes really is a Chinese hoax?
What if every deluded political scheme to combat it, is still the very best shot to bring awareness?
What if the accountability we lack is extraordinarily clear to the governmental chinese, who in their right see a schizo application of shared meaning in groups around them?
What if the United States presents true liberty but has instead decided to run butt-naked full force backwards on alll fours trying to catch the rest of the world in the smell of their farts?
What if the grand suiciding, and despair present in so much of the first world's younger generations come from a scaredy catness of not inadequacy but the teeming potential so great they see in themselves before proceeding to flee?
Who would care of such things? maybe no one in their right mind sure, but there is oh so much potential for peace and prosperity in the transcendant beautiful worlds which we currently only get to visit in pretend with our minds 

[10:48:45] Tapeda: even if it could one day, be drawn back to present day. (cause why couldn't the universe just be infinite, telling the same stories under an ever new set of rules?, what if one day we create a self-replicating machine the size of planets, slowly filling every point of which we call space with defined state-functions, and this creation proceeds to bootstrap penrosian cycling as its center becomes grander than a hundred thousand galaxies by itself, and proceeds to generate anew.)

I will now return to our regulalrly scheduled programming of more light hearted whimsy to inform my functional dialechtic shitpostings, but i felt the need to say HI in an interluding sort of way, that also makes bonus points;villeneuve's older work is for sure not a 'nice' experience and coarse in its own french-canadian way, so i would call it a mistake to watch prisoners, and sicario, but with his hands on Dune i find in interesting to know where the director comes from personally to better judge his intepretations. And second perhaps keep some of that man juice flowing around your body my dude, I'm sure your prostate "Milker" is great in its handlings of your stress relief, but i think you can get more creative than that ;)😂🚔🆗
[11:06:58] Tapeda: also found our boy bach to have some interesting analysis in his newest interview; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMfA6i60WDA&ab_channel=Science%2CTechnology%26theFuture
[11:12:46] Tapeda: and here's one i find a lot more blind, yet nonetheless interesting conversation to see done publicly at this time https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3p8o3-7mvQc&t=5758s&ab_channel=BetterLeftUnsaidwithCurtJaimungal

[01:51:07] h0p3: Forgive me for taking so long to respond. I'm sorry. I am thinking about what you've said. I'm elated to hear from you. You leave me with a lot to think about. 
[02:10:06] h0p3: > I find with the culture's we have today, there's a little block missing somewhere deep in the chain, one which we all still bleed, in and by the name of the beast,

I'm too often ignorant (as you know), but this is pure poetry to me. [[YWSOAM]], and [[ridtyawtr]], and I'm missing the words to even connect correctly. I'm sorry. Don't stop speaking of it, please. I feel like I am lucky enough to perhaps hear some people speak of this, and I'm honored to hear, see, or experience even a semblance of yours too.
[12:48:54] Tapeda: hahaha no forgiveness neccesary, i mean i took a month!
[12:49:42] Tapeda: [[ridtyawtr]] speaks to me quite a bit, I'm going to use this, cool!
[16:31:09] Tapeda: And because i can't help myself.... 

“Being an agnostic means all things are possible, even God, even the Holy Trinity. This world is so strange that anything may happen, or may not happen. Being an agnostic makes me live in a larger, a more fantastic kind of world, almost uncanny. It makes me more tolerant.”
― Jorge Luis Borges

“We have shared out, like thieves, the amazing treasures of days and nights.”
― Jorge Luis Borges

“I do not write for a select minority, which means nothing to me, nor for that adulated platonic entity known as ‘The Masses’. Both abstractions, so dear to the demagogue, I disbelieve in. I write for myself and for my friends, and I write to ease the passing of time.”

“It may be that universal history is the history of the different intonations given a handful of metaphors.”
- Borges
[16:32:00] Tapeda: “One day or one night—between my days and nights, what difference can there be?—I dreamed that there was a grain of sand on the floor of my cell. Unconcerned, I went back to sleep; I dreamed that I woke up and there were two grains of sand. Again I slept; I dreamed that now there were three. Thus the grains of sand multiplied, little by little, until they filled the cell and I was dying beneath that hemisphere of sand. I realized that I was dreaming; with a vast effort I woke myself. But waking up was useless—I was suffocated by the countless sand. Someone said to me:

You have wakened not out of sleep, but into a prior dream, and that dream lies within another, and so on, to infinity, which is the number of the grains of sand. The path that you are to take is endless, and you will die before you have truly awakened.

I felt lost. The sand crushed my mouth, but I cried out: I cannot be killed by sand that I dream —nor is there any such thing as a dream within a dream.

— Jorge Luis Borges, The Writing of the God”
[16:32:23] Tapeda: “The years go by, and I've told the story so many times that I'm not sure anymore whether I actually remember it or whether I just remember the words I tell it with.”
― Jorge Luis Borges, The Book of Sand and Shakespeare's Memory
[16:38:02] Tapeda: “Then he reflected that reality does not usually coincide with our anticipation of it; with a logic of his own he inferred that to forsee a circumstantial detail is to prevent its happening. Trusting in this weak magic, he invented, so that they would not happen, the most gruesome details.”

[16:38:06] Tapeda: “When I wake up, I wake to something worse. It’s the astonishment of being myself”
― Jorge Luis Borges
[16:39:08] Tapeda: “It also occurred to him that throughout history, humankind has told two stories: the story of a lost ship sailing the Mediterranean seas in quest of a beloved isle, and the story of a god who allows himself to be crucified on Golgotha.”
[16:39:15] Tapeda: .
.
[16:39:16] Tapeda: “God must not engage in theology. The writer must not destroy by human reasonings the faith that art requires of us.”
― Jorge Luis Borges
[16:40:09] Tapeda: “Captivated by its discipline, humanity forgets and goes on forgetting that it is the discipline of chess players, not of angels.”
― Jorge Luis Borges
[16:40:46] Tapeda: “The art of writing is mysterious, the opinions we hold are ephemeral....”
― Jorge Luis Borges
[16:41:53] Tapeda: “Why do you seem so annoyed at what I'm saying?"
"Because we're too much like each other. I loathe your face, which is a caricature of mine, I loathe your voice, which is a mockery of mine, I loathe your pathetic syntax, which is my own.”
― Jorge Luis Borges
[16:47:19] Tapeda: “The web of time - the strands of which approach one another, bifurcate, intersect, or ignore each other through the centuries - embraces "every" possibility. We do not exist in most of them. In some you exist and not I, while in others I do, and you do not, and in yet others both of us exist.”
― Jorge Luis Borges

[17:01:29] Tapeda: “I believe the secret of the success of psychoanalysis resides in people's vanity.”
― Jorge Luis Borges


[17:01:46] Tapeda: “Solomon saith: There is no new thing upon the earth. So that as Plato had an imagination, that all knowledge was but remembrance; so Solomon giveth his sentence, that all novelty is but oblivion. Francis Bacon: Essays, LVIII”
[17:02:03] Tapeda: and finally for tonight, 
[17:02:04] Tapeda: “The morning sun shone over the bronze blade. There were no more traces of blood left. "Would you believe it Ariadne?" said Theseus "The Minotaur almost didn't defend itself.”

[17:22:57] Tapeda: https://pastebin.com/rjQ3gBDi
[18:31:22] Tapeda: don't worry of responding particularly, it's that i'm not entirely sure if it's me or you I write for any=which,way;-A.^CZ
