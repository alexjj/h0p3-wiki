I'm still thinking about what you said. That's a lot to take in. I [[hope]] you don't mind my blathering nor that I speak from my ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 to you as well. It's a [[hyperconversation]]. I appreciate your patience with me in my original research into my own stupidity here, XD. Reiterating, again, sometimes it takes a long time to [[connect]]  (qTox, like many P2P programs, waits for both ends to be up before messages can be transmitted), and I don't mind that we take our time.
