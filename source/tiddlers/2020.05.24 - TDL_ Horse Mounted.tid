title: 2020.05.24 - TDL: Horse Mounted

* Let's dive back in. The horse appears mounted. Ride.
* I hate to say it, bud, but you are fucking up on your [[chatlog]] [[review]]s. Cmon.
* [[Disco Elysium]] is not overly-tantalizing, [[awe]]-inducing, or too addictive. Keep it that way. 
** Moderation, sir. Learn you it.
* Continue nudging your daughter to pick out a laptop. This is her process to own. She must own her machines. 
** Still, ofc, I am quietly proud that she's hacking her way on a potato. It is art.
*** I think it reminds me of what her life could be like. 
* You might need to get some nail polish. Fuck the stickers.
** Should tape the edges perfectly though.
* Proxmox?
* As usual, you have thrown a billion things to do at yourself and chosen to do none of them. Congratz! =)
** Narrow it down.
*** Offspring's lives are what matter.
