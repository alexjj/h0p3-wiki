title: 2021.08.21 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: ( °┏＿┓°)

Meditation. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. They didn't do the kitchen, and they were up way too late. Humans. Annoyed my daughter, as I usually do (the contract has been broken, woman!). Cleaning. Noodles + Water + Footbath + LolVod. National championships. Super cereal.

Losing subs (no mention of them even being removed from my multireddits) and powerusers that matter to me. Accounts just disappeared, including their alts. =/. Extremely high [[S2NR]] getting crushed. The censorship is killing me. Only so many skilled people filtering feeds for the retards among us.<<ref "o">>

Pizza + Water, skipping between [[TTTOTW]] and LoLvod. Sleep by 6?

Woke at noon. Hit the spot. Meditation. [[TTTOTW]]. Made sure folks were on task. She came down, took her meds, and read.

My son buzzed my hair. He refused to cut an eyebrow off (or even one of them slice-cuts into the right), but he decided that giving me a mustache would be fun.<<ref "h">> I look exactly like you would predict. Lower temps on the CPU is good. Shower. 

Massage in her chair until she decided the table and full-body made sense. I learned what PT-Becky does on her neck, so I can do that now. //Inform the Jabba//! Don't crack it like a glowstick.<<ref "p">> She seasoned me like a cast iron pan after it had just been washed. Meditation. I'm keeping the mustache. ( °┏＿┓°). [[TTTOTW]]. 

Made sure folks were on task (my daughter and I continue to lock horns). Put my girl to bed. She's toast. This storm that's coming is wrecking her. [[TTTOTW]] + LolVod (too much, but I don't want spoilers). 

[[ASmith]]. [[TTTOTW]]. Dance. Tomatoes (with salt and pepper, ofc) + Bagel + Water. Vapelyfe.

<<footnotes "h" "He still doesn't have good control of his hands or recognize that he's missed places. Not methodical, but he pours his {[[Focus]]} into it. I can see that. He's doing his best. I am confident he will become confident in this practice, which is exactly what he said to me today.">>

<<footnotes "p" "Plankton's AI waifu belittled and mocked him so often, it's obviously his kink.">>
