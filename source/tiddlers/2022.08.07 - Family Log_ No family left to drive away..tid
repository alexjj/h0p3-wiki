!! What was interesting to you last week?

* It's been crazy hot, or feels like it.
* Dryer might be actin' up.
* [[5c0ut]] is now an executive chef at a school
* [[5c0ut]]'s body is feeling off, palpitations are less frequent, feeling anxious and depressed.
* Summary paper in, and chapter proposal in (shortly after an invitation to submit, lol)
* Low numbers of course reserves this semester; not sure what's up?
* I love Reggie (and his tomatoes)
* After talking to YPP, I feel much better about how CPE/intership will work.
* Enjoying moments of being a [[blob|Poem: Being a Blob]].
* //Hyperion//, //The Sandman//, //Arrested Development//, [[D2]]; thankfully, we are done with //Good Omens// (for now*)
* That was an amazing party, and I enjoyed our time at the tool store too.
* hax and maths with the youths
* My week has been alright, I'm happy I've not fallen off of my work as well. I've worked on getting a SS13 server settup, which has been fun an is nearly done!-I just have a few tweaks to make and I'll be good. I've played quite a bit of baro with friends, but one of them got tired of the game and decided to take a break from it-I also had an interesting conversation with them about saving money. I don't remember much else-and nothing relevant.
* Birthdays, tools, Diablo, Hyperion, and The Sandman. Damn good week.

** I have been doing a good job of keeping on school.
** You have been doing a good job of keeping up on all your daily necessities without hassle. Thank you!
** Good job on the plumbing, sir. 
** I've enjoyed talking about the server you are setting up. I hope you'll give me a grand tour when you are up for it.
*** It's not gonna be the nice one I dream of eventually creating, but it is one where I can pull shenanigans and commit admin abuse.
**** =D
** i think it's cool that you're trying to set up a game server!
** I will remember you. This makes me very happy. Thank you for being worth remembering. 
* j3d1h
** i like that i'm making exactly the kind of art i'd like to see. (namely, designs i can stare at forever)
** Your idea to bring preacher cookies for Fr. Mike's retirement party is brilliant and snarky and I love that (and you)
** Thank you for helping me understand port-forwarding better.
** You are thoughtful about the nature of language. It's a good thing that you study it from so many of them. I appreciate your [[wrestling]] with hard questions I throw at you, lookin' out for answers, and so on. I'm glad to hear about what you've been searching for too.
** It was a pleasure to study math with you. You're quick. 
** Your character design has improved in even the short time I have been here, and it was not bad to begin with. I hope to see you do something with it someday.
