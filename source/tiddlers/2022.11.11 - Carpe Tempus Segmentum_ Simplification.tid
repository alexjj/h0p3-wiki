title: 2022.11.11 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Simplification

A cookie and drank. [[TTTOTW]] + //Obi-Wan Kenobi//, almost half an episode. //Trump: The Comeback//, almost half. //Frozen Planet II//. Mortal kombat. A surprising amount of human conversation embedded. Plenty of [[Awe]], left wondering what those [[other]] minds are experiencing. Hard not to feel the pull of protecting one's young from an animal-eat-animal world; one cannot unsee it. Breeder empathy. Also walruses are nasty, but I bet they feel warm and cushy on the inside. David Attenborough proclaims, "Now is their time to shine," and my sympaticon rips an awakening 3-pointer. Perfect timing.

//Skintime// + //Red Rising// @3:04:26:24 with my sympaticon. Speaking of sleeping inside walruses, *spoilers*, warriors trojan-horsed inside dead horses for an important battle scene. I have no idea how they smelled on the outside or the in. Irish-Scottish Hogwartsian Sardaukar Battleschool in the Middle Ages continues. She fell asleep. 

Chilled until mi amor was awake. She slept. Good mood for just waking up. //Skintime// and mini-massage as she prepares. Bringing stuff home given conference next week. We need to shop for 3 days of lunches for her and whatever she wants to bake. //Frozen Planet II// + [[TTTOTW]]. Paper towels for mi amor, nutterbutter sammich, farted into a tiny potion bottle, sealed it, and placed next to Richard on the staircase. Don't mess with his poppers.

[[TTTOTW]]. Sleep by 7:30?

Woke at 1:15. Vivid dreams. Cleaning. [[TTTOTW]]. ⁸Δ⁸

Shopping @ W-Entity with my sympaticon. Minor foodstuffs, searched for boxes. Price mismatches. U-Haul was no better. 

Offspring were grinding in [[The Den]]. ⁸Δ⁸. They decided to read //The Apology// today. `/nod`. Cool. Son wants to make [[Recipe: Lentil Soup]]. Dope. A snippet to [[Ian Clarke]]. [[TTTOTW]]. Called ISP again. Continued to work through some bullshit. Offspring moving to a local git for the project; they were unhappy about it.

2/3rds a match of [[MTG]] with my daughter. =D.

Mi amor called. 

//Raw Skintime//. //Inform the Men!// 

Watched my daughter and sympaticon face off, game 2 of unofficial match. I was surprised how long the game took. My sympaticon took it down. That recursion hit hard.

[[TTTOTW]]. Cheese. Lots of thinkin'. A microgrowery makes some sense. Why buy flower? On and off thinkin' about it for a while now.

Laundry. My sympaticon lowered my ears. I like my beard. Shower. 

Artgroup. Paid attention and listened, as I do. Eggnog with my sympaticon, and then put her to bed.  A game, fractal-based mountains, and programming. A quiet one, again. `/nod`. Half-time. Put mi amor to bed (does not want to sleep). Laundry. Assignments. [[TTTOTW]].
