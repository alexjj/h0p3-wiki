[21.03.24 - 22:34:07] PiB-4-8ormal: bezos paid ppl to destroy the country
[21.03.24 - 22:34:42] [[ASmith]]: Bill Gates is sounding like a crackpot with his billionaire ideas
[21.03.24 - 22:52:49] * TAS_Helpbot sets channel limit to 21
[21.03.24 - 23:24:58] [[h0p3]]: Fuck Bill Gates and Bezos. I wish there was a hell for them to burn in. 
[21.03.24 - 23:26:16] [[ASmith]]: lol
[21.03.24 - 23:26:21] [[h0p3]]: (Not by choice), it is more accurate to call me a Bezosian or a Muskite than an American (obscurely borderized humans seeking borderless velocity of capital).
[21.03.24 - 23:26:46] [[ASmith]]: Chicago has begun to pay Millions in repparations to the Black American residents
[21.03.24 - 23:27:34] [[ASmith]]: Bezo's former wife has embarked on a stellar career of charity giving [[h0p3]] 
[21.03.24 - 23:27:57] [[h0p3]]: Chicago: https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/im-gonna-pay-you-100-to-fuck-off
[21.03.24 - 23:28:19] [[ASmith]]: the Bill Gates charity seems to be smeared and tarred sometimes, I don't know if its successful or not
[21.03.24 - 23:28:26] [[h0p3]]: Some sins cannot be paid for.
[21.03.24 - 23:28:51] [[ASmith]]: California is the 5th richest nation in the World
[21.03.24 - 23:28:56] [[h0p3]]: The structure of his charity is bifurcated. He's only making more money off it. 
[21.03.24 - 23:29:09] [[ASmith]]: obtained by the USA under war and kept from Mexico, one of the poorest nations
[21.03.24 - 23:29:24] [[h0p3]]: #wearethebaddies
[21.03.24 - 23:29:25] <TAS_Helpbot> [[h0p3]]: Error: "wearethebaddies" is not a valid command.
[21.03.24 - 23:29:32] [[h0p3]]:  #wearethebaddies
[21.03.24 - 23:29:38] [[ASmith]]: that was less than 150yrs ago
[21.03.24 - 23:30:02] [[ASmith]]: imagine for a moment how the tables would be different for Mexico if Mexico still had Texas and California
[21.03.24 - 23:30:24] [[ASmith]]: all the Gold, Oil and natural gas resources plus enough produce to easily feed all of Mexico and S.America
[21.03.24 - 23:30:57] [[h0p3]]: I have no idea how to envision that counterfactual. We have to give the world back the wealth we've stolen (and that still doesn't make up for the billions of people who have suffered). 
[21.03.24 - 23:31:33] [[ASmith]]: ok, well perhaps PiB-4-8ormal can help you
[21.03.24 - 23:31:48] [[ASmith]]: he probably has some firearms and ideas how to do that with you [[h0p3]] 
[21.03.24 - 23:32:41] [[ASmith]]: https://www.rt.com/usa/518873-evanston-black-reparations-first-city/
[21.03.24 - 23:34:19] [[ASmith]]: Russia registers THIRD domestically-created vaccine against Covid-19, PM reveals: New jab CoviVac joins Sputnik V & EpiVacCorona — RT Russia & Former Soviet Union https://www.rt.com/russia/516125-third-coronavirus-vaccine-covivac/ 
[21.03.24 - 23:34:30] [[ASmith]]: Are you a anti-vaxxer like PiB-4-8ormal , [[h0p3]] ?
[21.03.24 - 23:34:37] [[h0p3]]: I own a single firearm and a nice crossbow, and it makes me sick. I know I'm required to have 'em. If we actually had to use them, the 2% of Americans who own the vast majority are going to protect capitalists successfully (that's my prediction); that's what reactionaries do. I agree, however, we have to own these terrible objects. 
[21.03.24 - 23:34:54] [[h0p3]]: No.
[21.03.24 - 23:35:14] [[h0p3]]: I still have to wait another month to get mine here in CT. Taking forever.
[21.03.24 - 23:35:44] [[ASmith]]: I see, and with the UK, Brazil, S.California and African Mutations spreading like wildfire
[21.03.24 - 23:35:52] [[h0p3]]: (but, I appreciate the order they are going in...older people, front-line folks, teachers, nurses, important jobs...I'm a loser who lives in his basement, lmao). 
[21.03.24 - 23:36:36] [[ASmith]]: I've spent about 50% of my working life as a front line medical provider, first job was as a paramedic circa 1970's
[21.03.24 - 23:36:38] [[h0p3]]: I barely know enough to know the implications of those mutations still. I can only pray that the vaccines we have will be effective.
[21.03.24 - 23:37:24] [[h0p3]]: I was saying the other day to a friend of mine how much I respect you (he interviews people). 
[21.03.24 - 23:37:31] [[ASmith]]: undoubtedly medical labs are crunching the numbers and tweaking what they have to see how wide the vaccines antibodies immunize against
[21.03.24 - 23:38:34] [[ASmith]]: RiteAid and Walmarts are likely going to begin providing the Johnson and Johnson 1-shot Vaccine
[21.03.24 - 23:39:37] [[ASmith]]: US diplomats in Russia have asked to receive Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine after Washington failed to supply doses — reports — RT Russia & Former Soviet Union https://www.rt.com/russia/516020-diplomats-sputnik-supply-fail/ 
[21.03.24 - 23:40:29] [[h0p3]]: It is interesting that news of vaccines didn't come out until almost immediately after the election. I assume pharma is trying to figure out how to make as much as they possibly can off this. Would cost //merely// $25 billion to vax the world (and the US isn't lifting a finger to help anyone).
[21.03.24 - 23:41:24] [[h0p3]]: (and, yes, Gates is a huge beneficiary of this clusterfuck, investing in vaccination infrastructures/policy-creation years before this hit)
[21.03.24 - 23:41:54] [[ASmith]]: normally 8 years from start to finishing tests and human trials avg's 8 years for Vaccines
[21.03.24 - 23:42:41] [[h0p3]]: I do appreciate that. This has been much faster than average.
[21.03.24 - 23:42:41] [[ASmith]]: 6 months is quite a push, Russia, China were already well on their way working on a SARS vaccine which they tweaked mid-stream to deal with Covid19
[21.03.24 - 23:44:11] [[h0p3]]: I do feel somewhat hopeful when I see how many institutions and people changed gears to work on this. 
[21.03.24 - 23:44:50] [[h0p3]]: Not everyone is evil. 
[21.03.24 - 23:45:19] [[h0p3]]: Sir [[ASmith]], do you believe in moral realism? 
[21.03.24 - 23:45:21] [[ASmith]]: Well on a China, Russia level it was survival
[21.03.24 - 23:45:54] [[ASmith]]: well that's a good question, one that in university level ethics in philosophy proved difficult to answer
[21.03.24 - 23:46:18] [[h0p3]]: Aint nobody got an answer that we can be certain about, I realize.
[21.03.24 - 23:46:20] [[ASmith]]: what would moral realism be for a african hardened child soldier?
[21.03.24 - 23:46:40] [[ASmith]]: would it be reduced to Kill or be Killed?
[21.03.24 - 23:47:41] [[h0p3]]: Let us define moral realism as accepting two claims: (1) There is at least one moral proposition with a non-false truth value, and (2) Moral values are objective properties of objects (including those with subjectivities) in the world. 
[21.03.24 - 23:48:22] [[h0p3]]: There is a difference between what the child knows of moral realism and whether or not it's true or applies. 
[21.03.24 - 23:48:49] [[ASmith]]: the shooter in Colorado, he thought people were watching him, condemning him, his moral realism was they were and meant to harm him?
[21.03.24 - 23:49:01] [[h0p3]]: That there is a good or right thing in each case doesn't imply we know what it is.
[21.03.24 - 23:49:54] [[ASmith]]: if the shooter was deranged or not, he was clearly a sharpshooter killing 10 shoppers and employees along with a handyman in the parking lot and a copper that arrived
[21.03.24 - 23:50:02] [[h0p3]]: Again, I suggest there is a difference between the shooter's understanding of the world (including moral facts) and whether or not there are moral facts. 
[21.03.24 - 23:51:16] [[ASmith]]: as unhinged as the world appears at this time, that's quite a task
[21.03.24 - 23:51:18] [[h0p3]]: You are concerned with culpability, moral responsibility, perhaps moral luck, sussing out what it means to try to particularize a universal to our contexts, in these cases, extreme contexts (juices our intuitions on the matter).
[21.03.24 - 23:51:26] [[h0p3]]: Fuck, yeah. True dat.
[21.03.24 - 23:52:22] [[h0p3]]: You agree that the Zionists, the racists, the power-hungry sociopaths of the world have done something morally wrong though. 
[21.03.24 - 23:52:37] [[h0p3]]: In any universe, it's wrong to do that shit.
[21.03.24 - 23:53:12] [[ASmith]]: yes, daily, NOBODY brags about shooting 100 State of Palestine children holding protest signs with butterfly rounds in the kneecap but the most evil Zionist scum on earth IMO
[21.03.24 - 23:53:55] [[ASmith]]: in some cases the screaming child immediately bleeds out, other times the Zionists prevent ambulances and medical care and while others suffer a blown off leg and survive the trauma
[21.03.24 - 23:54:01] [[h0p3]]: And to hell with the people who turn a blind eye, try to sweep it under the rug, act like it didn't happen. 
[21.03.24 - 23:54:14] [[h0p3]]: Evil itself.
[21.03.24 - 23:54:48] [[h0p3]]: I have ex-friends who live in that area of the world. Completely pro-Israel. Blows my mind. I thought I knew these people. 
[21.03.24 - 23:56:00] [[ASmith]]: gunning down children for holding a protest sign, George Washington would vomit over the USA Gov supporting such evil acts
[21.03.24 - 23:57:20] [[h0p3]]: Racism is a disease meant to distract us, to misdirect our anger that ought to be destined for the capitalist, to turn us against each other. 
[21.03.24 - 23:57:23] [[ASmith]]: A distant star just exploded, went nova and is visible from Earth right now — RT World News https://www.rt.com/news/518887-star-supernova-visibile-earth/ 
[21.03.24 - 23:58:40] [[ASmith]]: A pope ordered all of the early drawings and paintings of the mother of Jesus, Mary drawn in black charcoal, burned. mary was a pure blood Ethiopean which are among the darkest people on Earth even now
[21.03.24 - 23:59:27] [[ASmith]]: I was pleased so see one of the ancient drawings, paintings that survived that holocaust in a monks tiny home on the top of a rock cliff some years ago
[21.03.25 - 00:00:00] [[h0p3]]: Doesn't fit The Narrative. 
[21.03.25 - 00:00:06] [[h0p3]]: You visit monks often?
[21.03.25 - 00:00:13] [[h0p3]]: One of my teachers was a monk. 
[21.03.25 - 00:00:25] [[h0p3]]: He was an extremely gentle man.
[21.03.25 - 00:00:26] [[ASmith]]: now and then, tibetian monks, christian monks, each have some interesting views to offer
[21.03.25 - 00:00:35] [[h0p3]]: Yes, sir.
[21.03.25 - 00:00:47] [[ASmith]]: There's two Ripoche's residing near me which is quite rare
[21.03.25 - 00:00:50] [[h0p3]]: I used to live in Thailand. Some of the monks there were very thoughtful humans.
[21.03.25 - 00:01:08] [[h0p3]]: searching, don't know what that is
[21.03.25 - 00:01:31] [[h0p3]]: Ah, k
[21.03.25 - 00:01:38] [[ASmith]]: Ripoche's are reincarnated masters of their schools of knowledge, much like the Dala Lama but in a different area of knowledge
[21.03.25 - 00:02:23] [[h0p3]]: I saw plenty of monks who taught people that it was better to feed dogs than starving children on the streets (because somehow those children deserved it via karma). 
[21.03.25 - 00:02:39] [[ASmith]]: #math convert 135 MM to Inches
[21.03.25 - 00:02:39] <TAS_Helpbot> [[ASmith]]:: Error: MM is not a valid unit.
[21.03.25 - 00:02:54] [[ASmith]]: #math convert 135 mm to inches
[21.03.25 - 00:02:54] <TAS_Helpbot> [[ASmith]]:: 5.31
[21.03.25 - 00:03:32] [[ASmith]]: wow, the Japanese amateur astronomer that discovered the supernova was using a 5.3 inch mirror on his telescope
[21.03.25 - 00:06:11] [[ASmith]]: https://www.rt.com/op-ed/518953-western-hemisphere-us-military/
[21.03.25 - 00:10:04] [[ASmith]]: US health officials lobbied Brazil to REJECT Russian-made Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine despite 250k pandemic deaths, report confirms, then Sec State #Blinken absurdly attempts a Fascist 2-step blaming political threats over Vaccines on Russia. https://www.rt.com/russia/518153-brazil-us-sputnik-vaccine-rejection/ 
[21.03.25 - 00:10:52] [[h0p3]]: Ugh.
[21.03.25 - 00:11:51] [[h0p3]]: I think anyone in a position of power in even a local municipality should have to lose their privacy as far as I do, at the very least. 
[21.03.25 - 00:12:52] [[h0p3]]: Btw, currently: https://philosopher.life/#Hidden%3A%20Sidebar
[21.03.25 - 00:13:09] [[h0p3]]: Some kid made a cute video about the site, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDnd7_lSM3M
[21.03.25 - 00:16:07] [[ASmith]]: hmm, [[Jaxx]]: would be the deep web expert here, cards, drugs, guns, conterfeit bills

[21.03.25 - 00:26:41] [[h0p3]]: You ever considered being a librarian?
[21.03.25 - 00:26:49] [[h0p3]]: I think of you as one, btw.
[21.03.25 - 00:27:13] [[ASmith]]: no, I thought my university library classes were among the most important that I took however
[21.03.25 - 00:27:29] [[h0p3]]: I take that back, you are one. I mean, have you ever considered doing it formally, etc.*
[21.03.25 - 00:27:33] [[ASmith]]: the University of Oregon had 5 librarys which I actively visited and utililzed perhaps there were more however
[21.03.25 - 00:28:12] [[h0p3]]: When I teach youth, I teach 'em to pirate. Aint nobody gonna be without media if I can help it. 
[21.03.25 - 00:28:32] [[ASmith]]: I've always been interested in the art of Edgar Cayce that visited the universal library, to everyone's sorrow, he did that far to much for his body to handle
[21.03.25 - 00:29:08] [[ASmith]]: his guardian spirit told him if he slept on a book or stacks of books when he woke the next day he'd remember them to the page
[21.03.25 - 00:30:14] [[ASmith]]: unfortunately for him, he had zero interest in school beforehand so his sudden know it all was far to much to be brushed off so he was pretty much seen as a leper 
[21.03.25 - 00:30:46] [[h0p3]]: I always sleep with Kant's Groundwork under my pillow in the hopes that I'll finally understand it through osmosis. 
[21.03.25 - 00:31:26] [[ASmith]]: The Akashic Records as they are called or such
[21.03.25 - 00:31:47] [[ASmith]]: https://www.edgarcayce.org/the-readings/akashic-records/
[21.03.25 - 00:32:06] [[ASmith]]: https://www.eomega.org/article/mystic-edgar-cayce-explains-the-akashic-records
[21.03.25 - 00:36:12] [[ASmith]]: The big bang resonance 7.83 hz biaural Schumann resonance to activate the pineal gland and 90 hz well being and balance https://youtu.be/nqMWOyDI2WA
[21.03.25 - 00:40:10] [[ASmith]]: Binaural beats, a nifty way to introduce very low frequency tones into your brain and pair them between the bridge that links your left and right hemispheres
[21.03.25 - 00:41:56] [[h0p3]]: Currently, https://philosopher.life/#Music%3A%20Library
[21.03.25 - 00:42:21] [[ASmith]]: ah
[21.03.25 - 00:42:26] [[h0p3]]: I am working toward that softer end of sound though.
[21.03.25 - 00:43:21] [[h0p3]]: Gave my wife a massage today to something in that area. Trying to help her relax. 
[21.03.25 - 00:43:34] [[ASmith]]: This is a new ole school Aum Chanting - OM at 396 hz Binaural for a universal mantra dissolving negativity and removing fears https://youtu.be/UiSkMxltu00
[21.03.25 - 00:43:47] [[ASmith]]: nice
[21.03.25 - 00:44:01] [[h0p3]]: Indeed. I'm a skinhungry sumbitch myself.
[21.03.25 - 00:44:30] [[h0p3]]: Gonna write out all my hate first, then work toward just fuckin' chillin. 
[21.03.25 - 00:44:30] [[ASmith]]: probably have much in common with PiB-4-8ormal here
[21.03.25 - 00:45:49] [[ASmith]]: well you could compare your demons with Lord_XetroV here
[21.03.25 - 00:46:02] [[ASmith]]: then your hates with PiB-4-8ormal , be all set
[21.03.25 - 00:46:06] [[h0p3]]: lol
[21.03.25 - 00:46:10] [[h0p3]]: You are like a conduit, sir. 
[21.03.25 - 00:46:19] [[ASmith]]: happy to serve
[21.03.25 - 00:46:29] [[h0p3]]: Yes, sir. I respect that. `/salute`. 
[21.03.25 - 00:48:28] [[ASmith]]: Edgar Cayce's There is a river might be helpful for you, its on kindle also
[21.03.25 - 00:49:36] [[h0p3]]: Lookin at it now.
[21.03.25 - 00:51:20] [[h0p3]]: Older I get, the more I accept that I'm a mystic (unthinkable to me even a decade ago). This Thing-In-Itself has changed my mind: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dialetheism/
[21.03.25 - 00:52:49] [[h0p3]]: Thank you for the music recommendations, btw. 
[21.03.25 - 00:52:56] [[ASmith]]: yw
[21.03.25 - 00:53:34] [[ASmith]]: I enjoyed the psychology of logic which I'm reminded of with the dialetheism and various two-way truths being explored therein
[21.03.25 - 00:54:04] [[h0p3]]: For the longest time, I thought it was bullshit.
[21.03.25 - 00:54:33] [[h0p3]]: Spend 10 years in academia studying analytic philosophy to finally get my ass HANDED to me by this monster. 
[21.03.25 - 00:54:43] [[ASmith]]: the psychology of logic is very principaled, you can insert math directly into nearly any theme, point, argument etc
[21.03.25 - 01:28:29] [[ASmith]]: wb [[h0p3]] , I'll turn in for the night here after I record some more audio files
[21.03.25 - 01:28:55] [[ASmith]]: https://youtu.be/1ZYbU82GVz4 Relaxing Sleep 
[21.03.25 - 01:30:19] [[h0p3]]: Gracias. And, sleep well, homie. Hope you get some sick zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzs.
[21.03.25 - 01:30:52] [[ASmith]]: perhaps, lots of stressors out there in todays times but I'm working on it
