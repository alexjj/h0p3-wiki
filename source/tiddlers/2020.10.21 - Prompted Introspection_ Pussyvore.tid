title: 2020.10.21 - Prompted Introspection: Pussyvore

!! What is the last thing (or one of the last things) you searched for on the Internet? Why?

This is a wonderfully dangerous question for an extremely online retard like me. I think this is way broader and harder to answer than it looks too. The internet is larger than the web, and search is more than just using a search engine. I also can be searching for multiple things, and some more passively or with different priorities than others. I definitely want to keep it lewd whenever I can too. Hells yeah.

Pussyvore. Like that //American Gods// scene. It matches a dream I had as a boy too. IIRC, I was at a baseball game. I was swallowed, and I lived in that cave.<<ref "i">> That isn't why I was searching for it though. I stumbled across it somewhere (and I don't feel like trying to trace that either). It was sitting in one of my tabs, and I thought I might as well dive into this awesome world. Something like ~50 links in history spawned according to FF.

`/slowclap`. These people have keen dirty minds. They are my kind of scum. <3. I also appreciate being both predator and prey here; they both sound at least partially appealing. I like to be covered and I like to devour. I often think of Quality^^tm^^ sex as a double ouroboros. I want both. Just smear it all.
