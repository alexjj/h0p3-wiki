>>>>> Hrm. Those are some odd leaps of logic to make from what I said, [nomad](https://philosopher.life/#Find%20The%20Others).

>>>>> Do you really think no one deserves anything? I'm not so convinced you do, though I've encountered my fair share of people who utter those words. I understand you have an MBA, a piece of paper often attached to those with abnormally high rates of dark triadicism. I assume you may be fairly low empathy (common among the exceptionally privileged) to feel "how much people are struggling right now is calming." Do you consider yourself an egoist? Surely, you think that those who called themselves your friend failed to empathize with you. If anything, what do you think people who suffer strokes deserve?

>>>>> Obviously, I'm not agreeing to the claim that everything happens for a reason, though I'm also not convinced that is even close to the biggest lie that people spout all the time (surely you are being hyperbolic). Further, there are many ways in which people worship and make exceptions of themselves. 

>>>>> It sounds like you are still figuring out what actually matters in life. I'm willing to speak with you about that, if you want. 

>>>>> Also, if you're looking for a cheaper option to get high, you might consider Δ⁸ distillate.

>>>> No one deserves anything. “Everything happens for a reason” is the biggest lie that people still spout all the time.

>>> `/nod`. I wasn't disagreeing with you. It's documented that even hyperwealthy people who simply have their privileges handed to them without feeling like they earned it don't feel happy. Roughly ~115kish yearly income is where we see the diminishing returns for happiness, but that is only on the condition that the person believes they deserve it. Note that one can come to believe they deserve it for reasons that are highly deceptive (including self-deceptive). It sounds like you are wise enough not to feel like your birth lottery is something you chose or that you've earned that privilege. It sounds like you are more honest than many.

>>> I'm giving you reasons why it's hard for many to admit.

>> I was born with wealthy parents but I certainly am not happy. But I feel you

> People want to feel like they deserve their happiness, and they will lie to themselves and others to maintain a story about their lives that will make them feel they do deserve to be happy.

I’m from moderately rich parents and I fucking hate this mindset. I was lucky to be born with parents that could help me.

Don’t really get why that’s hard to admit

I See you looked at my profile and yes, I am pondering the meaning of life. I have been concerned with me lately because I’m still irecovering and without a job. Ideally I would like to help people tho? I often pass my wealth down to others without expectation of anything in return, but ego is definitely something I have to remind myself I struggle with. 

I do ponder the meaning of life all the time. 

Delta 8 distillate is illegal in utah unfortunately. Getting clean isn’t hard. (For me) 

I was being hyperbolic. That isn’t the biggest lie. Lol. 

I got my mba partially so I Could keep my mind moving and also it’s important to my parents. Not here to argue that the piece of paper means anything, or I learned anything that anyone else can’t.

[[h0p3]]:

Indeed, I read people's [[public self-model]]s. It's part of [[fostering intimacy]] and figuring out how I can be useful (if at all) to the strangers I meet out here in the digital desert.

If you have any other places I should read or observe, I'll do so.

I [[hope]] you keep a journal. It's pretty crucial too in my experience. I didn't start doing it every day until I was about 30.

How is your recovery going?

Though you are in good physical condition in many respects, are there permanent limitations you face?

It is not always possible to have an occupation that serves as one's vocation, to serve [[others]], but you may be better positioned than most to find such a thing. Do you have any candidate activities that stick out to you?

I assume you have a medical marijuana option for Utah then. `/nod`.

[[Cameron Larson]]:

Probably better than most. Partially due to advantages I have from wealth.  I don’t keep a journal but that’s a good idea! Handwriting is a limitation of mine. It’s hard to raise my right shoulder above my head. My right hamstring is useless. 

You can follow me on Instagram but I rarely post there besides songs

Yes I have a med card but The company I’m applying for doesn’t need to respect the card as they are not based in utah

[[h0p3]]:

I highly suggest typing or perhaps speech-to-text (as my [[friend]] [[MJos]] does).

[[Cameron Larson]]:

My speech is my final limitation. I had to relearn to talk

[[h0p3]]:

You may not ever be in a position to do significant physical labor, I take it.

[[Cameron Larson]]:

If you have a good email I’m happy to send some videos !

No

Relearning how to talk must have been a difficult experience. I'm having a hard time imagining what that would be like.

Was it strictly speech, or all language use?

Btw, I am happy to speak asynchronously and over very long stretches of time. I am not in a rush, and you should feel comfortable taking your time to think and respond (some people require years).

[[Cameron Larson]]:

Strictly speech. I know what I want to say, it’s hard finding the words sometimes. I’m actually decently well spoken over written English.

Emails sent. Thank you friend. I’ll be going to an appt now. May I reach out again?

[[h0p3]]:

I can see you've been through some hell. Your recovery has been a significant mountain to climb.

Of course. Please take as long as you wish, respond as often as you want. I do my best to be a thorough interlocutor and friend to anyone who has the time to speak with me.

`/salute`.
