Firstly, I am by no means a highly-educated knowledge worker or anything like that.  I went to school for programming over twenty years ago, and I am a butcher by trade, so pardon my lack of tech-savvy terms or good ways or explaining things!

I dropped the Green Elephant years ago and was somewhat of a digital note-taking nomad for a what seemed like an eternity. Was on Dynalist Pro forever (side and side for the last two years of Evernote), played with Joplin, paid for Notion for a year.  The last couple of months of Notion is when I really started to grow a deep infatuation with Markdown.  Either ironically or by fate this was right around the time words like Obsidian and Roam Research were getting talked about.  

It was also in the transition of moving from Atom Editor to VS Code for all things syntax-related and rand into ideas like [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/).

One of the things that made Obsidian work for me is the fact that the markdown files are workable outside of the application itself.  I have always looked at Obsidian as sort of a workspace, something of an open canvas and it's until you play with the settings under the hood and then add your own arsenal of community plugins that you truly unlock its potential.  I would like to consider myself something of a Minimalist but the reality is I have about 90 plugins and half of them I simply could not live without.  Completr, Global Hotkeys, Text Transporter, Lumberjack, Periodic Notes, hell the Minimal Theme itself just to name a few!

Back in the day I was always infatuated with the Tiddly platform and the idea of having your own persona wiki. When you see what is possible when you look at things like [this](https://philosopher.life/#:) how can you not? We have all spent too many hours down the  Wikipedia rabbit-hole and the idea of having something like that comprised of all personal knowledge and something of a commonplace book, may quite possibly be what I have been trying to accomplish my entire life. 

So when I started out I used it as simply nothing more than a notebook.  Daily notes and a keyboard shortcut for the win!  As time went on I started making dedicated pages related to topics that concerned me.  When when I was typing daily notes I started to do things \[[like this]] when I was typing naturally and the app makes it so easy with it's auto-suggestions and what not.  Before you knew it I am taking daily notes about interactions with customers at work and then highlighting those words and using text transporter to send that text to my [[Customer relationships]] page and leaving a calling card on my daily note so I remember the day that it happened.

When I started to use Obsidian (and long before I started my [[my Love letter to Obsidian]] file ðŸ˜Š) I thought there would be *no way* I would find myself naturally linking stuff but like almost all Markdown syntax it is quite natural for us who have been perched on a keyboard for most of our lives.

Until this becomes your natural behavior rely on search to find things.  If you're an experienced Evernote user you know all about it already.  Over time you'll assign a "move this note to x folder" to a keyboard shortcut and you'll be a wizard in no time.  You can use search results to help inspire you to build link/hub pages (MOCs look into them!) by copying the search results and enabling "wiki links".  

Spend some time looking at community plugins.  Best advice for in-app ways of doing this is to sort them by downloads.  Then take a look at the [Hub](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/00+-+Start+here) because it's an amazing resource for all things Obsidian and has a nice list of plugins by category, in a public Obsidian vault no less.

If you're really into daily note taking really do look into Lumberjack and Periodic note and obviously Calendar but I'm sure you're already using that!
