!! What is one of your favorite games? 

I adore [[Games]]. [[2018.04.21 - Prompted Introspection Log: Howto Play My Fav Game]], [[2019.02.02 - Prompted Introspection: The Game of Games]], and [[2020.01.08 - Prompted Introspection: Favorite Game]] are fine answers, but the superlative problem makes the question become so narrow that I don't explore the sub-games of life well enough. I'm glad to have it more open-ended.

Currently, I'm playing [[Disco Elysium]]. I'm not far into it, and I do not understand it well enough. I normally don't care for this sort of game at all, but it's well done. It's a story to a point that I'm not even sure it's a game except in terms of choosing how you want to navigate without dying. I feel like I'll have a chance to better understand the people in my life that I [[love]] with it. Time will tell if it stays a favorite. I can easily see this game having replayability. There's too much to take in.
