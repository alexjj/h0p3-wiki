Yo, madame senpai! I love you. Yeah, we've not interacted enough. You're my [[Root User]]; feel free to call anytime unannounced or otherwise, if that would be preferred. I agree that [[Impassionata]] is fascinating, especially during these times. I've almost read their complete [[PSM]] (they've been more active than usual lately, I suggest); it's gonna take a while to piece my argument together for them given the sheer number of contradictions (I do not predict they will have much interest, but we'll see). I've been watching your work like a hawk too, ofc (I still [[aim]] to be your most loyal reader...I think your wiki updates comprise 98% of my web-based notifications these days). Some of your arguments have reminded me of Saint Aristotle's concerns with teleology. Those are some mighty maxims to live up to. Many religious texts have no digital copies, and if there are any you need a scan of, let me know (I'll see what mi amor can do). My [[/b/]] is increasingly gibberish each day (plenty of the [[Recent]] work inspired by [[Impassionata]] in particular), and, no, you aren't stupid, lol (far from it, madame), :P. We're hanging in there; the adults are stressed and worn, but the young humans seem to be doing just fine. How about you?

Haven't had nearly enough interaction with you this year, [[https://wiki.waifu.haus/#Senpai]]. Been enjoying your work on Impassionata. Fascinating individual. I'm stuck deep in the weeds trying to [[reconstruct|Reconstruction]] something, living up to my new maxim: [[IIIISBWD|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#IIIISBWD]]... But that was prompted by him(?), as well. And I've tried to get my head around some of that there /b/ stuff but, no, [[I'm too stupid|https://c.tenor.com/i463VY2CftIAAAAd/reimu-idol.gif]]. Hope your folx are well.

; 2021.12.04 - @chameleon

That's a good idea, madame. I'm thinking about it. I may need to do that no matter what. It goes from 3 to 8 seconds to load on [[m16]], and there is no difference on [[m20]] (8 seconds either way). Those are acceptable times to me. I am very fortunate though. Beyond reading from the timeline itself (bottom-to-top with hoverlinks aint bad), it has some functionality to it (though the advanced search with filters still seems the better way), but I think most of what it does is prove a point: there's consistently a lot. It does make the open-multiple greenlinks in [[Recent]] worse though (would it be worth removing it from that?).

<<<

Our fingerprints match. First half should be a hash of your pubkey and the second a hash of mine. They can be posted in public safely, though they do leak some types of information. If you just post that string without context, anyone who knew my fingerprint would still be able to deduce that you were likely speaking with me over Signal (though they can probably figure that out reading our wikis too :P). I think it's an odd practice for an application so hellbent on maintaining identity through a phone number (which suffers all the usual problems) rather than keys, but I admire it. Insofar as it is not theater, it's probably most seriously useful in having users recognize changing runtime environments and getting people to ask: "is everything alright over there?" At some level, in full remote, verification is still done by hand, using the usual signals: does this person otherwise sound and behave like themselves?

<br>

; 2021.11.01 - @chameleon

[[monster]]-20 lives! Signal is tied (and retied) to the phone (and phone number) which starts or maintains the account (a convenience tradeoff). When you reinstall, reset the phone, or get a new one, Signal should require other users to verify (most people just click through, but it provides the cautious, <3, an opportunity) in order to prevent (or help us catch) MITM attacks. There are several ways to go about verifying, and we're doing it now, =D (as I consider this the source of truth, excepting revocation from the master [[verification|Verify]] key, should I sufficiently lose control of my [[monster]] and the current signing key). At least for the time being, stylometry and [[shared]] knowledge are still crucial ways to know you aren't speaking with an imposter, allowing one to rebuild [[trust]] from otherwise scratch too.

Your absence in my life is something I feel. We know this pain. You know I'm reading. And, I'm honored that I get to read too. You have nothing you have to explain to me, [[Root User]]. I'm always glad to listen though. I love you more than I know how to put into words. I miss you too.

It's been too long. I am trying not to use Discord (failing, of course). I know you are looking out for me. It's obvious. Thank you. I like that you let me fail with you, Senpai. I'm still thinkin about what it means to produce notifications. Discord is up, I lurk. I'm lookin out for you too. Like my uncle [[Charlie]] and [[BDS97]], I'm aiming for Reply Mode across the board. I'm gonna keep workin' on lurkin. I know how delusional that sounds. I do feel like I'm losing my mind, though I'm not in a dark place (well, not any darker than usual!). I'm going to keep listening. Yes, I do trust you. I grind and unravel.

<<<

Agree to disagree? Personally I think it's [[a good thing|https://wiki.waifu.haus/2020.06.29 - finally]]. Places like gendercritical were absolutely causing harm to trans folk that I know (and myself). Getting rid of the spaces reactionaries use to organize and recruit is, in my opinion, a net good. They deserved to be deleted.

Idk. I feel this is going to be our big disagreement. I don't buy the "free speech" defense here. There are places where our principles will clash, and we have to prioritise - like Maslow's hierarchy of needs. For me, free speech is higher on the pyramid than the baseline of safety for the people I care about (and, selfishly, myself) and thus I'm willing to cede it in this case.

I have no money for books right now, sadly. I would read my pdfs, but... reading books on a monitor is unpleasant. I'd rather send them to an ereader or something, but idk if it'd work with my kindle (I've barely used the thing).

>     Not so interested in piracy. I'm surprised. She probably has plenty of methods of access to everything she wants.

Oh I'm totally into piracy, lol. I'm just pretty good when it comes to sources (I use libgen for books, and various public trackers for music, movies, etc). The reason I'm not into private trackers is because of the elitist community (you have to take a fucking exam to get into some of them) and the fetishism around ratios (I can almost never get a good ratio, because I only go on private trackers for obscure shit, and can't afford to seed 24/7).

I'm sorry if I seem a bit aloof about some conversation topics. I'm trying to I guess, invite you to say the first word on the topic? Maybe I'm just really bad at communicating :) Don't take my silence on something as boredom or dislike of the topic. If I don't want to talk about something, I'll be clear on it - like you with saying "that's evil" I am not shy about saying "that's boring" or "that makes me uncomfortable" `^^`

>     I wonder if she will ever surface again to go public.

I imagine I will, eventually. The KF thread in mind is so shit it'll eventually get locked (it's already just a drama channel for waifuists, and the most active guy there is a huge a-log) and then I can move back into public without worrying about being a source of ridicule.

>     I should ask her about a bunch of sources for anime memes.

They're common enough in group chats/discord servers. I get mine from there, and I also have a huge stash from my chan days.

Always ;) Of course, us waifuists are considered weird even among weebs, so I hope I wouldn't weird them out too much `^^`

Stupidly, I haven't been reading her. The website is actually too wide for my laptop, so I can't read it comfortably (reader mode isn't available for it, either).

I remember reading a mention of it! I would like to hear about your trips and travel in general. Immersing yourself in a different culture is always a special experience.

I've been to Morocco! Technically Africa, even if it's closer culturally to the Middle East.

I hated that trip though. Remind me to tell you about it sometime.

I appreciate that you are so [[thoroughly and charitably considering|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#DeathOfRobinhood]] my correspondence with [[DeathOfRobinhood]]. I'm sorry if it makes you [[sad or angry|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#2020.02.02%20-%20the%20other%20dor]]. I totally get how it feels alien (I think I'm often an alien speaking with aliens). I'm grateful that you would spend so much energy digesting it; if it turns out not to be fruitful in our relationship, I apologize.

I got pretty lucky... I played my buddy Robert, who uses a black/blue milling type deck which is very weak to the deck I play; and I also played a younger kid who had to cobble his mono-red deck together because half the deck he walked in with was illegal. Those matches I went 2-0, and in the other two of four I went 1-1 and 0-2. A big reason I'm building a new deck is because that deck, while good, relies heavily on good draws and sharp play. It's like playing `1. e4 c5` as black in chess.

Yo, [[Congratz|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#2019.12.26%20-%20forever%2025]]! What decks did you play against? Anything stand out to you in the tournament? The heart-thumping moments? =)

Thank you for both of your congrats :) I should reply on @ more.

I signed up for letter.wiki after seeing it in your link log: https://letter.wiki/KonataIzumi/. They wanted me to use my real name, but I'll do that (unfortunately, quite literally) over my dead body. They can enjoy the pseud. I browsed through; I almost responded to a TERF, but I don't think that's a terribly good idea, we will quite literally end up talking past each other.

[[Liberal|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#2019.11.07%20-%20*shakes%20fist*%20liberals]] is one of them really hard words to define. I can't say I'm a huge fan of the variations of Maoism I've seen, but I'm not sure the lines make sense to me either (e.g. I'm not convinced there's a meaningful difference between factory workers and farmer-peasants). I'm convinced the Rule of Law can be peeled apart from dictatorial totalitarianism (though perhaps that's uncharitable). To some [[dok]], I admire the fervor and willingness to sacrifice, admission of the necessity of violence, the vigilant appreciation for neverending class struggle, and the pursuit of unification of what I take to be Maoism. As a political program applied in the world, I consider it a failure (though that is typical of any system I've seen applied) since it still centralized political [[power]]. It never escaped capitalism in my eyes.

It's an art project. We're making art out of books for my wife's library's "Books+Art" competition thing. It's preachy AF, ofc, as always. Still brainstorming and hashing it out. Thinking about making a tiny bookshelf to have the students think about their own books. We're thinking about making a tiny wiki for this project in particular too, as I think it would be nice to have part of the exhibit sit in cyberspace. It's just {[[Dream]]}ing for now.

My opinion is likely irrelevant, as usual, =). I don't know what [[ratification|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#Emigration%20Checklist]] looks like for you, and I'm sure you are ridiculously busy. I doubt you will need it, but you might. Plenty of people won't give a shit about your piece of paper, especially given your experience (though there are plenty who don't care about experience but focus way more on the interview and networking process itself), but if you think it would be difficult to ratify this once you are in the states, I think you should do it now. I've had to present my own credentials here and there, and it's a [[ltf]] blessing to be able to just whip out your credential-genitalia on command.

When I'm wrong about what matters, you should call me out! While I have the political right, I do not have the moral right to say just anything. I'm grateful you would take the time to say something and to hold me accountable; it is [[The Golden Rule]]. I appreciate your desire to help me express the truth in a palatable way. Unfortunately, what I have to say eventually becomes unpalatable to most everyone in the end. Are you sure you aren't unjustifiably tone-policing me? Are you sure you aren't pointing to rhetoric rather than substance here? Despite how little I quickly say in that one bullet-point, there is more to see in this wiki. It's not clear to me you have taken the time to evaluate my sentence in my context with sufficient charity. I think we have just a misunderstanding here.

If it makes you feel any better, these were her words. I also don't think it's absurd because it's true. Unless it's necessary, I'm not here to quibble over the locution, connotation, and conversational implicature (as an autist [even this is shorthand, right?], that would be an endless task for me with everyone I meet and read). Tell me the significant semantic content that differs if you think I'm wrong. I think it's reasonable to cut me some slack in this case.

For irrational and immoral reasons, Whitney doesn't want to work with or be around this woman who is married to a transexual person (and, yes, the details are morally arbitrary in this case). I am taking her to task, and I suspect I will have to defend my new co-worker. To be clear, when Whitney signaled for this outgrouping with her disgust about this gossip, I corrected her with a: "cool, that's wonderful," knowing full well that turns me into an untouchable with her and anyone she tells (certainly my boss, as I have seen). She chose not to wrestle much further with me on the topic though.

You are correct that I owe the entire rainbow a great deal. I think I know something about this solidarity you speak of, and I cede very little ground when it comes to morality. I have the opportunity to defend, explain, and justify the moral rights of persons all the time with the people I teach, including those who have [[power]] over me. Yes, I regularly intervene and listen to my youth on these topics. However imperfectly, I'm actually fighting in the trenches here; I'm paying the price in my mission. I aim to follow [[The Moral Law]] all the way down, as you know (which is hardly to say I'm succeeding). Does this ease your conscience some?

<br>

; 2019.08.25 - [[@h0p3|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#%40%3A%20h0p3]]

In your wiki review - 2019.08.23 - Wiki Review: Bacon is Delicious - you mentioned that Whitney was "married to a trans". My approximate reaction. That's a really strange way of putting it. A trans woman (mtf) or a trans man (ftm)?

Ever since meeting Nobu (a trans woman) I've been wary of phrasing like this, it leads down some sketchy avenues. I'm very enthusiastic about LGBT rights, being a pansexual woman myself, and from my perspective solidarity across the entire rainbow is indispensible; cede a centimeter, and social conservatives will take a kilometer.

IDK, this isn't a callout post, it's your wiki and you can write what you want (and even if I didn't say that I doubt I could stop you from doing so, lol). Just my conscience demanding I say something, really.

Your possible [[future computer|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#2019.08.14%20-%20New%20PC%3F]] looks amazing. I'm excited. Random thoughts from someone who doesn't know computers as well as you: 

* The cooler that comes with the Ryzen is loud, imho, but I've not slapped my hyper212 on it (maybe I should).
* One of the reasons I didn't go with that SSD is because it is QLC. We've had 2 SSDs die on us in our household, so I'm worried about it (perhaps irrationally). Nvme has not disappointed me! 
* I assume you will be gaming or doing GPGPU with that beast! You might consider a cheap GPU for passthrough.
* If price matters:
** You might consider dropping to a 3600/3600X.
*** Single-threading is still king to me, but you may make far more use of those cores than I would.
** When was the last time you used an optical drive? I still had a floppy drive 2 builds ago, and my last build, [[monster-10]] still has an optical. Might not be worth it; I simply don't know. If you've used one in the past year, then I think should you should keep it.
* I know some people think 32GB of RAM is too much, but they are wrong. I think this machine will last for a long time.
* Call me shallow, but I want to see the case too! =)

No, doubt, the wiki is a [[mind-amplifier|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#2019.07.30%20-%20Loper%20OS]]. It's a fuckton of work, imho, but it allows one to autonomously generate feedback loops, abstractions, and relationships in the stories we tell ourselves like no other tool I've used before. Tools which help you communicate better with yourself (iteratively improving or growing representations) may often be amazing [[communications devices|http://www.loper-os.org/?p=568]] as well.

I know you are still rapidly piecing together the infancy of your wiki. Who knows when you get the chance, but I'd be interested in [[your reasoning|https://wiki.waifu.haus/#2019.07.30%20-%20%22Exists%22]] about [[John "everythingstudies" Nerst]]. I'd be interested in his response to your thoughts as well. It takes a special mind to do philosophy and engineering.

Aside, I'm enjoying your linking to other people. You know how to pick out the [[beautiful]]-weird. I'm hoping in time you will be able to reveal a history of all the cool and crazy [[gems]] you've encountered. You give me the feeling like you've got 10,000 rabbitholes to pull out of your hat.
