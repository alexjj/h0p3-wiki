!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family (including ourselves)?

* 1uxb0x
** I think I handled the slipping on ice pretty well.
** It's been good to see you dive into SQL. Building something for gaming sounds like fun too.
** I've noticed you've been finishing meals off solo more often. I'm glad to see you're feeling more comfortable on your own in the kitchen.
** I like that you feel comfortable critiquing and disagreeing with your school books! I like that you're really thinking through what you're learning and trying to synthesize information into moral actionable ideas.
** You're kinder and more empathetic than almost any other human I've met.
** It was very kind of you to offer to talk. It meant a lot to me.
* j3d1h
** I think I'm pretty good with the social cues thing, for a homeschooled dork.
** Thank you for the [[restart-memory-hogs.sh]] tool. 
** I am very much enjoying your additions and thoughts about our TableTime study discussions; you are thinking through the information very carefully.
** Thank you for being engaging in setting up the steam family library between us.
** Thank you for that engaging conversation about the meaning of colors in charater wardrobe and personality design
* k0sh3k
** It was a crazy stressful week, but I managed to keep all the things in order that I needed to.
** Your recent TableTime tutorials have brightened everyone's days. 
** Your paper is lookin' good.
** I respect how you made up for the huge mistake of SL. You handled it well.
** Thank you for all the book recommendations!
** Thank you for the book!
* h0p3
** I do not give up easily, and I've often earned the right when I do.
** Thank you for being you. Being near you is a source of joy and I look forward to as many amazing conversations, walks, and companionable presence sharing days as can be had in the time we are allowed. Thank you for the love. And for teaching me to play magic proficiently.
** I like that a lot of your language is very precise.
** Thank you for thinking about the car situation with me, even when I was getting upset about it.
** Thank you for the link on autism, it was interesting.
* ASK
** You've done a good job searching for [[hope]]. I'm glad to see you're still hunting in the wild too.
** That chicken + roasted veggies meal was amazing. Thank you.
** I know we've not been able to walk much, and I'm [[grateful]] that you spend that time chillin' in [[MTG]]. 
** Relentless in your introspection, you've been [[wrestling]] with the rules of your own survival, and that is as expensive as it gets sometimes. `/salute`.
** I'm glad you're giving yourself permission to spend time just thinking and not feel guilty about it.
** You make some damn good bread.
** I think it's cool that you have a thought process behind most everything you do (and one that you can cleanly put into words, from what I've seen).
** I've enjoyed talking to you.
