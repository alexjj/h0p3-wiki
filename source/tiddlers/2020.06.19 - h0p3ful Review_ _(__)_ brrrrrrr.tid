** Eventually, you may want to atomize this. For now, I like that you've decided to have a single dumping ground.
*** You may find this place could grow so large that you'd want to start breaking it into different bodies of organization.  
** I [[hope]] you continue down this path. It's practical, [[beautiful]], and useful for everyone. Who doesn't like good food? 
** Your butternut squash+sweet potato dish was outstanding. I've only had that dish a few times in my life, and it was the best preparation I've ever had.

** Why do you think you aren't courageous? Courage appears in different contexts.
*** Your willingness to search for the truth, especially the ugly and painful ones about ourselves and the world, requires a courageous constitution. You openly explore and look behind veils that scar people for life.
**** Look, I'm not saying you are just as courageous in all places (and this is one of the points of virtue theory, ofc, that the [[dok]] of courage maps onto the particular [[salient]] features of a given context), nor am I even saying you are as courageous as you ought (given what you have) in all contexts. It is false to say you aren't courageous at least sometimes, and especially given the amount of effort it takes to have your courage when facing some of the problems you do (including speaking to a monster like me).
***** Here's a fun one for ya: your wiki is public. I know very few human beings who have the courage to be as honest as you, sir. That is higher praise than I know how to tell you still (despite how often I attempt to describe what I understand).
** Yeah, one can walk the plank with courage.
*[[2020.06.18 – TDL: Don't]]
** Yeah, this has feeling in it, but it's still too generic. Keep fleshing it out.
*[[2020.06.18 – Prompted Introspection: Great successes.]]
** Wow. You and I have completely different understandings of your greatest successes. I'll add that you've had different answers over the years too.
*** For example, one of your greatest successes is shaping character to be kind and tenacious. Your raw persistence and willingness to fix what's wrong is something you've earned.
*** Your ability to communicate is a radical success given your circumstances. 
*** I don't think you are even remotely big picture enough here. I get that the question asks you how you //feel//, but I'm hoping that your affect and cognition will be aligned on the fitting targets too.
** I'm glad you are thinking about what you value. It's a hard problem. Keep going, sir.
*[[2020.06.18 – Carpe Diem: Whazitmeantoyou?]]
** I think you are fleshing these out more faithfully. Thank you.
** Re-doing?
*** Ah, sometimes that's what you gotta do. I am really glad that you know when you need to back up the train and read it again. Knowing what you don't know, sensing it probabilistically, is a profound philosopher's skill. Continue your excellent work, sir.
**** You may also aim to find patterns of comprehension failures seeking to isolate how to improve the odds that you will understand something through behavior modification.
*[[2020.06.18 – Antipleonasm Analysis: Bias]]
** I feel misinformed reading what you wrote. =)
*** Yeah, I'm really good at making jokes.
** [[bias]] <---link to it. Better yet, digest with it.
** I wish you would flesh this out further. It seems too flippant to me.
*** Further, you barely even touch the quote itself. I appreciate your work on a foundation for addressing it.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** I think it's dope that you use textart, like `\("/)/`. One of the interesting parts of our wikis is just how much silly fun and informal expression can be found among some otherwise incredibly serious, difficult, and even painful considerations. You throw paint at the wall, sir.
