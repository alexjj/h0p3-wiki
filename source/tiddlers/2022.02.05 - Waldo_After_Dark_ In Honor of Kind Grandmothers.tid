title: 2022.02.05 - Waldo_After_Dark: In Honor of Kind Grandmothers

"""
02:28:48 AM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: Hello, how's everyone doing.
07:02:33 AM [[h0p3]]: Hanging in there, https://philosopher.life/#New, grinding away, sir.
07:02:36 AM [[h0p3]]: How about you?
01:20:08 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: been better number 4 since august, my other grandmother passed today at 10:15am. ill be back soon have a few errands.
01:47:37 PM [[h0p3]]: Shit. I'm sorry.
01:47:54 PM [[h0p3]]: What was she like? Who was she?
01:48:25 PM [[h0p3]]: Are you in charge of arrangements?
01:49:03 PM [[h0p3]]: (I'm also going off and on my [[monster]] today, and I have no problem speaking asynchronously*)
04:17:50 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: She was my mothers mother. A gentle soul very intelligent and an avid reader. Im not in charge of arrangements. Im not sure yet what the plans are for those. She many years ago, before her first marriage to my mothers father was a waitress in a diner where she said she met Elvis when he apparently drove a semi or something similar before he was famous. Said he was quite a flirt, and tugged on ...
04:19:06 PM [[h0p3]]: That's crazy. Met the king himself.
04:19:14 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: her tip apron and her tips went all over. She said she made him pick it all up, lol.
04:19:19 PM [[h0p3]]: Sounds like a dope grandma.
04:19:39 PM [[h0p3]]: I bet he got a kick out of that.
04:19:53 PM [[h0p3]]: What did she like to read?
04:20:04 PM [[h0p3]]: (and, what do you like to read?)
04:20:55 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: she was a very kind and loving woman I never remember personally seeing her uncalm myself.
04:21:17 PM [[h0p3]]: I wish I had that composure.
04:21:50 PM [[h0p3]]: How'd she die?
04:22:31 PM [[h0p3]]: (also, how's the set up going for your battlestation? I haven't heard much about it)
04:24:32 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: Honestly I am not totally sure about her favorite things to read I didnt get a lot of time with her because my family has always been too far from me most of the time. I know she was a speed reader and read scripture many multiple times. I recall she loved novels but do not recall her favorite authors. I honestly have what most would consider quite a boring and utilitarian reading habit.
04:25:10 PM [[h0p3]]: I know what it's like to live far away from family. `/nod`.
04:25:27 PM [[h0p3]]: You actually read. That seems to be growing uncommon these days.
04:27:50 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: I read normally only books that can teach me a useful skill or reference knowledge. honestly its been longer than id like since ive had the time to sit down with one. Too many distractions due to living conditions. My room is full of references such as various programming and technology and science related books. I like older books such as books on engineering and and university subject books like
04:27:59 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: chemistry and so on.
04:28:21 PM [[h0p3]]: That makes sense. Dense and useful.
04:28:55 PM [[h0p3]]: Feels like there's just not enough time for long-form pleasure reading.
04:29:27 PM [[h0p3]]: Older I get, the faster I am to put it down if it aint workin'. Attention span seems to be fucked up too. Half the time, I'm just skimming or searching for particulars.
04:29:38 PM [[h0p3]]: It's not deep reading.
04:29:47 PM [[h0p3]]: Lacks some transformativity, imho.
04:30:52 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: quantum physics and anything which makes me think. I like cook books lol because i like to eat variety. I like philosophy and i guess im into everything including manuals as long as most isnt fiction unless its a comic, lol. I had a comic collection at one time but it was stolen during a move somehow.
04:33:23 PM [[h0p3]]: I've had to move so many times, I'm tired of owning paper.
04:33:53 PM [[h0p3]]: //Lazarus// and //Saga// are worth your time, btw.
04:34:20 PM [[h0p3]]: Graphic novel/comics that I keep re-reading again and again. Dozens of time.
04:34:48 PM [[h0p3]]: (not saying I agree with everything in them; but they give me plenty to chew on)
04:35:09 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: you see I have no vocal inner dialogue. so when I read my mind is in silence. So unless i smoke cannabis then my anxiety constantly makes the presence of others a massive distraction. I am obbsessive compulsive about not missing anything and not being interrupted by anything while reading until ive reached a stopping point. I will lose track of what I was doing because I have to sink into the book
04:37:00 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: i like deep conversations but also solitude when I need to truly do deep thought.
04:37:13 PM [[h0p3]]: Do you have aphantasia?
04:37:32 PM [[h0p3]]: I wonder what notetaking is like for you.
04:38:00 PM [[h0p3]]: I do not understand the implications of lacking that inner dialogue well enough.
04:38:32 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: it leads me to staying up for days quite often and becoming sleep deprived at times because i have to wait till others are asleep quite often to focus truly on reading.
04:39:16 PM [[h0p3]]: (cannabis is still relatively expensive for us; been using this instead: https://philosopher.life/#Product%20Review%3A%20%CE%94%E2%81%B8)
04:39:48 PM [[h0p3]]: I see. Do they bother you a lot or not enough [[silence]]?
04:40:08 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: i take notes in my head if its a person giving a lecture. im not too shy to tell others that speaking while the lecturer is speaking is counter productive and rude.
04:40:16 PM [[h0p3]]: (many folks in my home wear ear protection, also, bone conduction headphones work nicely in that case)
04:40:54 PM [[h0p3]]: You spend a lot time in lectures?
04:43:48 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: I have not had any in quite some time and i kinda feel like im in a fog and im not sure if its from all the stress of the family deaths or the cannabis. ive never really had an issue if i needed to take notes but im not fond of it and it tends to make me irritable. lol i can listen well as long as not surrounded by people uninterrested in what we are viewing etc. lecture was just an example...
04:44:30 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: I dont know why im this way honestly.
04:45:05 PM [[h0p3]]: Pretty sure most of the folks on [[DarkMX]] aren't neurotypical.
04:45:39 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: early in school I had to learn to teach myself because i was very horrible at the time at taking dictation.
04:46:01 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: So I just went home and worked through the books
04:47:24 PM [[h0p3]]: I wish we all learned to do that.
04:47:28 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: i had sometimes a difficult time comprehending the vocal ways people would try to describe things to me. almost as if my brain simply didnt want to listen to them because i would hear every little thing litteraly
04:48:10 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: i think its why I prefer music without words most of all
04:48:20 PM [[h0p3]]: Auditory processing disorder, perhaps autism, being flooded by a high-bandwidth of sensations, a chaos that we can't generalize and model price-efficiently enough
04:48:26 PM [[h0p3]]: You and me both, homie.
04:48:34 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: because i have to make my brain produce an inner voice
04:48:41 PM [[h0p3]]: https://philosopher.life/#Music%3A%20Library
04:50:29 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: yes i have a problem with sensory overload in alot of drama etc... but ive learned how to cope with it over the years. only when things get very stressful does it really seem to be bad. but cannabis helps but its been months since Ive had any
04:52:01 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: its weird i guess because i can make my inner voice any voice. I used to do a lot of vocal impressions and comedy stuff when i was younger for family and friends I was pretty good from what they tell me.
04:52:01 PM [[h0p3]]: Cannabis induces schizophrenic states, which, I hypothesize can be more useful to autists than the neurotypical because it may enable us to complete our Bayesian equations. An excess of imposing models over one's [[phenomenology]] might be exactly what an autist needs.
04:52:10 PM [[h0p3]]: echolalia type?
04:52:37 PM [[h0p3]]: Does MDMA do anything special for you as well, more than most?
04:54:12 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: i've only used cannabis. I was talked into trying coke once and it was a downer for me
04:54:33 PM [[h0p3]]: `/nod`
04:54:53 PM [[h0p3]]: Paradoxical reaction, maybe.
04:54:55 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: i hated it. felt like a had a head cold and was slowed down and still axious.
04:55:17 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: I was like see I told you I wouldnt like it lol
04:55:23 PM [[h0p3]]: Stimulants affect people with ADHD (high comorbidity) differently in some cases.
04:56:29 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: well they said I was ADHD when I was young but im not sure about that entirely. it was when they didnt know as much really
04:57:33 PM [[h0p3]]: Well, psychology, as an academic science, has been demolished lately. Look at the top 100 most cited studies, pillars of the discipline, and half of them can't even be reproduced. It's a crisis.
04:58:03 PM [[h0p3]]: We're still trying to piece it together.
04:58:09 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: they didnt really know as much apparently about autism or aspies. I have quite a bit of ashkenasim blood history but didnt know that until researching my surname. I thought it was simply German
04:58:16 PM [[h0p3]]: Interesting to see how computer scientists and economists often bring so much to the table there.
04:58:54 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: yes it is isn't it .
04:59:01 PM [[h0p3]]: I've not gotten a DNA test, but it has been suggested that's part of my Amerimutt bloodline as well.
04:59:13 PM [[h0p3]]: Verbal reasoning is abnormally high in that group.
05:00:38 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: ashkenasim personalities are often compared to aspie personalities etc... I guess I could get checked out but I dont want them having my permission to run my DNA. they will have to steal it if they want it lol
05:00:57 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: typo day for me lol
05:01:57 PM [[h0p3]]: I think it is a giant mistake to get one's DNA tested. The industry has a shit track record.
05:02:40 PM [[h0p3]]: Even going for open tooling to interpret isn't good enough. There's no way to guarantee the basic data won't be misused.
05:03:01 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: I think that with the guy who invented the merkel tree and what he is interested in that giving up our CODE is not a good idea.
05:03:04 PM [[h0p3]]: Perhaps one day there will be home kits, but probably not in our lifetime, I assume.
05:04:07 PM [[h0p3]]: He's a curious feller.
05:05:16 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: some of his tech is awesome. but him wanting to govern the world by quantum prediction is a god complex and is a danger to human freedoms
05:05:52 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: They made a movie about that but I forget the name
05:06:28 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: predicting what a person has not yet done and charging them with future crimes etc...
05:07:13 PM [[h0p3]]: //Minority Report// is one
05:07:54 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: sounds right
05:08:06 PM [[h0p3]]: Machine learning may provide non-trivially accurate predictions to the most [[power]]ful. I'm not lookin' forward to it.
05:09:39 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: I consider it an extention to eugenic thinking. I think they have convinced the world to generate hash they need for something by calling it currency
05:10:45 PM [[h0p3]]: Hrm. Well, I'm not convinced that blockchains are calculating anything useful at all.
05:10:57 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: all the technical components for an orwellian technocratic  system are basically in place
05:10:57 PM [[h0p3]]: Even Eth's VM is hilariously slow.
05:11:07 PM [[h0p3]]: Already at work, surely.
05:12:31 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: so much happening as of late to be a series of flukes and mishaps I think.
05:12:55 PM [[h0p3]]: What stands out to you in particular?
05:13:30 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: or they are playing one hell of a global psychological experiment.
05:14:05 PM [[h0p3]]: By "they", I assume you mean the wealthiest people on the planet.
05:14:51 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: honestly i feel that we are swimming in a world of propaganda designed to stimulate reaction from us to feed them data in everyway they can collect it
05:15:16 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: I dont know but I dont think they care about money
05:15:19 PM [[h0p3]]: That does appear to be an important part of the story.
05:15:45 PM [[h0p3]]: At some point, money doesn't buy you more [[power]], perhaps.
05:16:16 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: I think they are simply wanting to steer the species in a genetic direction they choose and not allow nature to have a choice
05:16:45 PM [[h0p3]]: I think it's not so easy to define what consists in "nature." One may argue that all things occurring in the physical world are natural.
05:17:31 PM [[h0p3]]: Including a dog-eat-dog war of all against all, one in which capitalists exploit others in pyramids, [as they] parasitically leech and lie their way to the top because they have no qualms doing what is immoral for competitive advantage.
05:17:49 PM [[h0p3]]: I do not suggest human nature must be this way.*
05:19:14 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: Im not sure what (They) would be honestly. I feel we are fed cultural bias to make various groups all think its the other groups shadow fraternal brotherhoods etc... just a bunch of megalomaniacs playing MOJO JOJO, Lex luther games
05:21:07 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: I believe they feel that they are doing all they do for the greater good of the species.
05:22:21 PM [[h0p3]]: Seems like a problem worth solving.
05:22:27 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: There may not even be a they. But that might be a worse situation. Because if there is no puppet master then humans are simply doing all of this to themselves
05:22:54 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: which is very possible.
05:24:14 PM [[h0p3]]: Hrm. Seems like we can speak of those in power without resorting to a radical puppet master with some grand master plan in full detail.
05:24:45 PM [[h0p3]]: And, I suggest even those who lack quite a bit of power are non-trivially responsible.
05:25:00 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: They may simply be a series of infectious ideals which have damaged the species at the root, the very language and definition, the etymological chain shows instance were words have been weaponized either on purpose or inadvertently
05:25:35 PM [[h0p3]]: I'll agree to a weak sapir-whorf hypothesis.
05:25:52 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: take the word race
05:26:59 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: it was either the 16th century or 1600's I forget, but that's when ethnicity was added as an extention to its definition. and definition controls word associations
05:27:48 PM [[h0p3]]: Social constructions and spooks all the way down, eh?
05:29:19 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: simply modifying a word association is enough to warp the liguistic strutures of reality. without words it would be quite a task to have a well structured thought or definitive perspective I think. words build our reality because of our social and herd like nomadic tendencies i think
05:31:58 PM [[h0p3]]: I'll agree that to some non-trivial (though incomplete) extent, our use of words influences our [[phenomenology]] and the manner in which we make implicit and explicit inferences. They don't structure reality anymore than the fact that these memeplexes are involved in human behavior.
05:33:15 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: what I am typing are not words on the screen, but text. Can you UNread this? or anything?  multiple languages almost all with various visual symbolic representations. but the core ideas that we call words can usually be represented in them all. So a word only exists in the mind. when we speak it is variable modulation of compression waves.
05:34:13 PM [[h0p3]]: There are multiple ways to represent words, including in text, and words themselves are representations.
05:34:32 PM [[h0p3]]: What it is that the word represents, however, isn't necessarily something that only exists in the mind.
05:35:05 PM [[h0p3]]: I suggest even the infinite interpretations of all symbols exist external to our minds, obtaining outside even the bounds of spacetime.
05:35:42 PM [[h0p3]]: I'm a Platonist.
05:36:23 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: true, what we can see in the physical reality is indeed able to be represented by words. but we can also use words in ways to describe things which do not yet exist in that physical reality.
05:36:55 PM [[h0p3]]: I will say "the physical part of reality"
05:37:34 PM [[h0p3]]: I'm not one for deflationary metaphysics. Though the destruction of metaphysics is the task that many have taken to be their job since Saint Kant.
05:38:20 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: it to me almost seems that many are easily manipulated by language which like computers could be considered programming
05:38:52 PM [[h0p3]]: We are non-trivially governed by many types of laws.
05:38:59 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: yes
05:39:37 PM [[h0p3]]: I am a fan of the computational theory of mind, but I'm not convinced it's a sufficient explanation of our [[phenomenology]].
05:40:20 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: would you say if we remove language from the human mind that we are left with anima, emotion and instinct?
05:41:30 PM [[h0p3]]: It is not clear what it means to remove language from the human mind. I'm not convinced one can have a mind without a type of language. Given Saint Hegel, I must remain open to the claim that information transmission is fundamentally linguistic as well, even between objects that we wouldn't normally or initially claim to be have minds.
05:41:44 PM [[h0p3]]: We're at a hard place (several, I think) in the history of philosophy.
05:42:20 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: I have not had much time to read over the personal site you shared with me, but from what I did read I recall thinking you have a beautiful mind.
05:43:01 PM [[h0p3]]: That's very high praise. Thank you. I'm still working to understand what I can.
05:44:55 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: its a very artistic site I think. very open and honest. not many would share in that way if not for socialmedia. its as if most of those on social media dont truly realize what they are doing at all.
05:46:21 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: i believe the there is inaction, action and reaction. to remain in control of ourselves we must remain in action or not in action and should for the most part avoid reactions which are not necessary
05:47:45 PM [[h0p3]]: I do [[hope]] to [[share]] as best I can. [[JYU]] and [[kickscondor]] have provided me opportunities to [[wrestle]] with the nature of social media. There's something to be said for owning our data and how we structure it, something that a company like FB would never allow.
05:47:55 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: reactions seem to be driven mainly by emotions and instincts and we should be mindful of whether or not we are being pinged to react with negative stimuli
05:48:55 PM [[h0p3]]: That reminds me of the [[Tao Te Ching]].
05:49:09 PM [[h0p3]]: [[Stoicism]] as well.
05:49:23 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: reacting to positive stimuli can also present as dangerous but we must choose in order to enjoy life
05:49:46 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: its odd being a human lol
05:49:51 PM [[h0p3]]: Yes, sir. I agree.
05:50:02 PM [[h0p3]]: :P
05:51:04 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: this type of conversation is why I enjoy this format. This format is not sabotaged to collect stmuli reaction data.
05:51:32 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: it is neither complex or over simplified
05:51:56 PM [[h0p3]]: I wish more people took the time to speak with each [[other]] in depth. It's hard to find [[intimacy]], especially in the pursuit of [[the other]] and what is [[salient]].
05:52:26 PM [[h0p3]]: It gives me hope to see that [[anonymous]] conversations are so often among the best I have.
05:52:57 PM [[h0p3]]: The darknet can be a bright place. [[ridtyawtr]].
05:53:24 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: facebook sabotaged that by introducing emoticons then people could fall for instict of conserving calories but still instigate reaction by misunderstandings or trolling
05:54:55 PM [[h0p3]]: So many problems with that network
05:54:56 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: the very format failures in comments if a person is in flow can create accidental tagging and further confusions due to the smartphone being its main portal interface
05:55:15 PM [[h0p3]]: What do you think of smartphones?
05:55:41 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: then they over stimulate similarr to the screen in idiocracy
05:56:15 PM [[h0p3]]: Unfortunately, it is difficult to authenticate with many structures in the world without a smartphone these days.
05:56:38 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: I am the opposite of a fan of them. not the hardware but how companies have made the interface choices
05:57:05 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: or UI designs and placements
05:58:26 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: the ui often is akin to a 90s popup chain mixed with layers etc auto load A/V which is blipvert length. intended to further accomodate short attention spans which will further shorten them over time
05:58:47 PM [[h0p3]]: preach, yo
05:59:12 PM [[h0p3]]: (the hardware has shocked me, btw...my phone now competes with my desktop in terms of raw compute)
05:59:55 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: ive got to see if messenger can be set to zero emotes on touching to scroll im surprised I have not taken a hammer to my new phone
06:00:34 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: and see if the message column can be moved to the left
06:01:14 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: they know most are right handed in many places and i think they set it up to trigger emote too easily
06:01:27 PM [[h0p3]]: I keep mine in a box next to my desk. I don't trust it much.
06:02:36 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: I am thinking of creating a custom droid version if I can make the time to get involved. Id rather BSD or linux but have not checked this model info.
06:03:29 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: I love the hardware outside of how they use it to force their will upon us.
06:03:45 PM [[h0p3]]: The [[Pinephone]] is fascinating.
06:03:59 PM [[h0p3]]: Unfortunately, it's wildly underpowered, and there's still far too much work to do.
06:04:22 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: I do wish the would make them thicker and use the space formuch more battery capacity and better camera optics
06:04:40 PM [[h0p3]]: I cannot fucking wait for a FLOSS, medium-performance, reasonably-priced phone where I control everything.
06:04:49 PM [[h0p3]]: Agreed.
06:05:20 PM [[h0p3]]: I'm happy to have a 1.5inch thick phone if it gave me triple the battery life. In fact, I've an old Samsung G3 with a modded case-battery that does that. It's outstanding.
06:05:26 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: They often are not very one hand ergonomic because of limited UI without modding
06:05:28 PM [[h0p3]]: Cyanogenmod still on it.
06:05:58 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: but I simply cannot make time to fix everything. Im apparently a grumpy old man lol
06:05:58 PM [[h0p3]]: Eh, I can't use it one-handed anyway. Small dick, small hands, and I'm too retarded. Can barely type on it as it is.
06:06:25 PM [[h0p3]]: Agreed. It's gonna take hundreds of thousands of people working together to make it happen, minimum.
06:06:54 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: yeah i have a bt keyboard i always forget to charge lol
06:07:07 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: so i constantly bitch at the phone
06:07:54 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: i honestly can safely assume most of those who witness me with a phone may be put in fear of my sanity lately lol
06:08:09 PM [[h0p3]]: =D
06:08:32 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: i bet me on a phone would be a viral youtube channel lol
06:09:02 PM [[h0p3]]: Speakin' of which, you have any recommendations or [[links]]? I'm a linkslut.
06:09:49 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: i wonder how many calories i burn repairing everything I type on it because auto incorrect probably uses global lingustic averages and thinks it knows what I want to say more than me
06:10:03 PM [[h0p3]]: Surely, there is an app for that.
06:13:03 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: what types of content? I have not done too much browsing lately. I did enjoy reading the site for 9front the fork of plan9 a while back. that guy is very upfront i found it fun to read his travel logs lol, ill be testing all three asap 9front, plan9 and inferno I hope.
06:13:40 PM [[h0p3]]: Anything that sticks out to ya.
06:13:45 PM [[h0p3]]: Plan9 is interesting.
06:14:04 PM [[h0p3]]: (this guy is too: https://roscidus.com/blog/blog/2021/03/07/qubes-lite-with-kvm-and-wayland/)
06:14:24 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: I cannot actually say that.I have constantly browsed but a better way of putting it is that I am not recalling much of it atm
06:14:58 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: that link text does show an interesting idea
06:15:19 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: i think quebs would melt most of my systems
06:15:28 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: lol
06:15:42 PM [[h0p3]]: It consumes so many resources.
06:16:08 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: ill be right back must step away from the keys atm
06:16:19 PM [[h0p3]]: might be more useful if we had better unikernel appification
06:16:24 PM [[h0p3]]: `/salute`
06:28:01 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: ok im back
06:28:10 PM [[h0p3]]: wb =)
06:33:26 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: thanks glad to be here. bought two more Sandisk64Gb usb sticks today im going to try and organize some files soon. and get everything in better order. Do you do any retro computer stuff. I have a couple of cds next to me one is Hobbes OS/2 the ultimate collection of shareware and freeware for OS/2 April 1997. the other is PFS: First Publisher by softkey for DOS
06:35:47 PM [[h0p3]]: Makes sense to me. I just got a 64GB one myself, using this: https://philosopher.life/#The%20Bootable%20USB%20Thumbdrive
06:35:56 PM [[h0p3]]: I don't have any retro stuff, unfortunately.
06:36:01 PM [[h0p3]]: I did, but it didn't survive.
06:47:18 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: i love that page lol
06:48:52 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: you know i saw a page ill have to find a gain for you. there is a person forking TempleOS calling it ZenithOS I believe. have you heard of it?
06:49:41 PM [[h0p3]]: You were telling me about that, "my opinion is that Ai should be developed within TempleOS or ZenithOS based on TempleOS because it has no networking stack built in yet"
06:49:44 PM [[h0p3]]: Fascinating.
06:49:51 PM [[h0p3]]: Also, Forth is an interesting language.
06:49:52 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: https://zenithos.org/
06:49:59 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: that was easy lol
06:51:15 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: yes. I like that you keep notes because i often live in a stream of conciousness that even I cannot recall at will
06:51:43 PM [[h0p3]]: Yes, sir. I know that feel, strongly.
06:53:07 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: ive wanted to start mind mapping but honestly my anxiety tells me that I would become so invloved in that, that I would lose track of the thought process i was working on so often ill just keep a text editor  open lol
06:53:17 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: but not always
06:53:35 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: once i get multiple monitors hooked up i will
06:53:37 PM [[h0p3]]: If I were only writing for myself, I think plaintext files would be the way to go.
06:54:14 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: what do you mean?
06:54:20 PM [[h0p3]]: emacs seems like a very deep rabbithole to go down too
06:54:29 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: oh yes
06:54:50 PM [[h0p3]]: Well, my wiki is not just for me, and I try to make my work accessible without having to know how to use the command line.
06:55:38 PM [[h0p3]]: Already, with WASM, we're seeing several attempts at Linux in the browser, and it's only a matter of time before full stack sites  (including the OS) will be completely clientside.
06:55:42 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: i saw a video from an author who went down it to adapt it to writing novels and when done it looks like it does an awesome job for him and has some cool features to move text blocks around.
06:55:58 PM [[h0p3]]: Yeah, it's quite malleable.
06:56:06 PM [[h0p3]]: Pain in the butt to learn.
06:56:09 PM [[h0p3]]: I'm too old for it now, I think.
06:56:13 PM [[h0p3]]: (still trying to convince my offspring)
06:58:08 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: I think its very powerful and I might try it some more soon but there is always a great debate in the community over text editors lol
06:58:49 PM [[h0p3]]: I use neovim and sublime text consistently, though not as a [[power]]user. I'm just a skiddie that squeaks by with his tools.
06:59:20 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: i will have to scroll through my phones history in a bit to see if i can find that video. it was informative i think.
06:59:27 PM [[h0p3]]: I'd appreciate that.
07:00:23 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: hey if you can exit VIM based on facebook questions that makes you a long bearded linux wise man lol
07:01:05 PM [[Waldo_After_Dark]]: hmmm... i just realized i should shave one day lol
07:01:37 PM [[h0p3]]: :P
07:01:55 PM [[h0p3]]: I have to afk, sir. Family Gathering, food, probably an episode of //House//.
07:01:56 PM [[h0p3]]: TTYL
