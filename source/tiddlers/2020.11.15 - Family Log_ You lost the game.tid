title: 2020.11.15 - Family Log: You lost the game


!! Write a paragraph summarizing each person's week:

* [[1uxb0x]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I like not talking, kinda been (by myself) trained not to. I think I'm going to try to learn Mono-blue, Affinity, and Burn for magic. I don't know why I have to leave my door unlocked on Sundays and Saturdays, and talking about that, I absent-mindedly lock my door, which isn't great. I thought about buying a video camera with a lot of space and recording what I do and where I go for 2 weeks.
** j3d1h
*** I'm glad you had some fun this week. I look forward to setting up the group call - I bet you'll find that really fun, too! While it wasn't the right move to make given the context, I still thought your short-term solution for math was fascinating. I'd love to see you develop your characters and such a little more in your free time. You seem to enjoy that.
** k0sh3k
***  I really like your boots; you did a good job picking those out. You played some cool games this week, it sounds like; I'm glad you had fun. I think your idea about tracking how much time you're spending in various places and what you're doing sounds like a good project. I hope you'll do better in your school work this week.
** h0p3
*** [[1uxb0x]] didn't do his school work, but he had plenty of fun (I should [[Alias]] this one). He can't remember his week, and that makes sense. I can't remember his week either. He had one breakdown, but the day was recovered. He played games, watched videos, autisted in his own head, got some sleep. He keeps his room locked consistently. He walked some with his old man, got some boots and even Taco Bell. The punk beat me in [[Magic]], and I swear I will have my revenge. He's been pretty quiet.

* [[j3d1h]]
** 1uxb0x
*** Thank you for setting up the group call, now I'll have to have social interaction. Thank you for drawing blaze for me, and overall I like your art, it's becoming much better. I'm gonna ask a lot of questions to broken souls-but mainly about smokeys and pip? P-something? -'s characters.
** j3d1h
*** I was very mixed this week. Everything was stressful and confusing, apart from a few good moments. I've found myself eating in short bursts (and usually not something healthy, because I don't care to //make// anything). Still, I enjoyed the productive parts. Broken Souls will finally be starting up (it's been forever!), I'm back to drawing in digital, and I think schoolwork might pick up.
** k0sh3k
***  I do like that you're talking to friends about your stress and time management issues; I hope you find something that helps you focus and gets you motivated. You did work hard on the bathroom this week, and did a really good job getting the tub cleaned up - thank you! And thank you for helping me pick out the Advent devotionals we'll be doing this year!
** h0p3
*** [[j3d1h]] has claimed to read for school and that she tried, but we do not have evidence of it. She has been feeling stressed about not doing her work. The tension between us continues. She's worked to avoid Youtube spirals and what she refers to as //escapism//. That's some heavy lifting there. She got some cleaning in this week, and she has been a good chef this week for the family. It's been good spending time with her. We went to Burlington, and she chose to be frugal with our money (choosing not to get anything because she wasn't convinced she needed anything; she builds trust with us on this front). It's interesting to hear about her social life and the drama in her circle of friends. She's working on a //Broken Souls// series with her m8s, and she's decided to have her desktop up and running again for art.

** 1uxb0x
*** That was an odd argument with JD, but also an important one. You are younger than you look, just as father is older than he looks. I think we're safe about the house. I haven't played any MTG with you, so we should do that.
** j3d1h
*** I'm very happy to hear about the house! Thank you for all the work you've done to get one. I can tell it's been one hell of a process. It's fun playing MTG with you - we should play more often. The advent book seems like it will be a lot of fun, I'm excited to try it! Also, that mango lassi //was// bad.
** k0sh3k
*** For myself: It's a good thing I can whip up a presentation in no time flat; that didn't help my stress levels, though. This week was crazybeans, really, and I'm glad this coming week is a slower week - and that the house issues got worked out and we'll be closing soon. I think my stress levels will improve immensely if I don't have to worry about finding a new place to live ever again. Pataka's was amazing; that was definitely an upside for this week!
** h0p3
*** [[k0sh3k]] has been sitting in limbo waiting on //The Asylum//, but perhaps the end is in sight, \( ﾟヮﾟ)/. There was a noticeable uptick in her stress this week, and I feel like she's been a bit more discombobulated. Perhaps we need to walk more together. She's enjoying her //Binti// book, //Star Trek: Discovery//, and her vocation (I [[hope]] to one day be as competent). She's spent a lot of time chillin with me, (ღˇ◡ˇ)♥ℒᵒᵛᵉᵧₒᵤ♥. Perhaps within a year or two, there will be a kind of normalcy and stability that might last for decades (and that's something unpredicted).

* [[h0p3]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I liked walking with you. I really think sister should play more MTG with you. If you don't want a sleep schedule, you don't need one as opposed to the rest of us (Well, nobody here reeeeeally needs it.)
** j3d1h
*** This week has been much smoother, at least. I've sort of been expecting to hear much more from you about the election? But, then again, it's clear enough what was going to happen. As always, your maymays were great (if sometimes sad), and the rest was disgusting. I'm glad I have friends who at least //warn// me when they're about to send/say something blatantly unethical. 
** k0sh3k
*** @卄ㄖ尸乇 : STAY AWAY FROM MY TOOTHBRUSH! I liked the links you sent me this week; thank you! We spent a lot of time together this week, skintime and watching garbage TV, which was nice. Thank you for letting me vent at you when I'm stressed. I feel like you've given up trying to normalize your sleep schedule, and may be happier to not try.
** h0p3
*** [[h0p3]] chilled a lot this week while curling up. He didn't speak with many people; it's a trend. He attended a conference camp meetup thing. He's spent way more time reading than writing (also a trend). Zero bliss this week was unpredicted. It kinda feels like he's trying to build a new relationship with his offspring. The girls are annoyed with my [[Music]] choices lately, and that clearly demonstrates a flaw in their identities.
