I wish you [[luck]] on [[your quest|https://hegelsbagels.net/posts/incredulity-pretension-society/]]. I'm [[grateful]] that you continue to teach us.

That is a beautiful sentiment. I suggest that, to some [[dok]], this resurrected or energized or moved inanimate matter is a dialectical extension of "the logician" (sounds almost like magician, and there's something magical seeming about it, I can't deny it). I think it can become a part of one's [[love]].

I was wrong about technology being like a cemetery. On the contrary, the logician breathes life into inanimate matter and makes it move, makes it love. There is a certain way of using technology that is actually like the Christian resurrection.

Huge fan of [[this topic|https://hegelsbagels.net/posts/autism-of-the-animal/]]. [[Saint Hegel]], [[Eros|Antipleonasm Analysis]], [[Love]], and [[power]] are crucial, I agree. I adore the strikethroughs you are using!

; 2021.03.21 - @h0p3: Truth = Power = Love

What is truth? Truth is what will out. If it doesn't out it's not the truth. This is the same as saying that might makes right, which is also a great truth. But the greatest truth of all is that truth is power. There is nothing outside truth and there is nothing outside power.—"But what of love, Coleman, you filthy trickster dirtbag!?"—Love is power and truth.—"But what of all the powerful evil people!?"—They hide from truth because they are afraid of being exposed as powerless.—"But what about Trump and Hitler?"—They simply love power. Love and power aren't evil.—"Where does evil come from then, Coleman, if you're so smart?"—Evil is the gap between truth and power that makes us into hypocrites. The cure for hypocrisy is Philophilia. Philophilia is the loving that loves itself so much that it can't content itself with weakness and gives itself power so that it can increase the narcissism that is its being. And because there is nothing outside it, nothing outside the economy of love, Philophilia spreads itself all over the world and dominates everything. Everything is a loving that goes and does not. Truth = Power = Love is the formula for wisdom. Beware of sophists who insist on empty differences.
