title: 2021.12.10 - Prompted Introspection: My Truth

!! Write about a time when you spoke your truth to others. How did it make you feel? What did you learn?

Your [[prompt]] is a redflag to me, Samwise. Generally, only malicious or ignorant people (usually both) wield this phrase: "speak your truth." I have to judge people by how they [[aim]] to define the concept of truth (and I'm not claiming to have a perfect answer, far from it). This isn't a place in which we should be ambiguous, in the same way that we should make clear distinctions between moral imperatives and mere social conventions (as [[Instrume]] demonstrates). I have little patience for relativists. The nice part about the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 is that I'll just point people to it instead of wasting more of my time on them directly (it's fairly uncommon for people to have the integrity to change their mind here in my experience).<<ref "m">> Slices through the Nietzschetards fast, though the work is front-loaded expensive for me.<<ref "on">>

Alright, I just "spoke my truth." It made me feel a bit sad. I've learned some more of what it means and what it feels like to write this in public. The ironic part is that I'm doing what I can to make it so that people can express themselves and explain their perspectives.

<<footnotes "m" "I grow tired of trying to answer questions, implicit or explicit, from those who never intended to listen, put their skin in the game, or have any serious integrity in the dialectic. I've given enough to the parasites, though I work to be polite and learn from everyone as best I can. You get my verbose [[silence]] otherwise. As I have said before, I am willing to burn bridges.">>
