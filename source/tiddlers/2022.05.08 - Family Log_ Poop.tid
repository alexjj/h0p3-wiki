* 1uxb0x
** I'm fully able to say I'm socializing more.
** Thank you for working so hard on the door! The handles are gorgeous!
** We can see the brass cleanly on the hardware. I have no idea why they didn't make it shine like you did. It looks good, sir.
** it's neat that you're looking into some aspects of game/map design.
** I have had a lot of fun watching movies and documentaries with you!
* j3d1h
** i'm glad i reached out to some gamedev communities.
** Thank you for helping me with the cookies! They were a good experiment. :)
** Thank you for baking cookies with your mother for work and for the family. They were delicious.
** Your painting of the trim on the front door was done carefully, and it looks good. I know you've not enjoyed the process, and I'm [[grateful]] that you've done it anyway.
** I like your fashion sense. Though you know my opinion about fashion: strictly from an appreciation of the aesthetic perspective, it's exciting to see you wander the space.
** Thank you for keeping me informed about my ex-characters.
** You are excellent at picking out the weird. You deserve the bragging rights for that hat. Well done.
* k0sh3k
** You do such a good job with your students. You work to relieve their stress, listen carefully, protect them from exploitation, and produce new librarians. You change lives and the world with your vocation.
** Thanks for studying with me. I'm looking forward to the coming 6 years of participating in your classwork with you. <3.
** You've done a good job documenting MP and remaining quite patient.
** You've a talent for inventing food. Your wrap is new to me, and it fits your needs while being delicious. 
** those cookies were awesome. :3
** Thank you for the sunday...biscuts? Whatever they are.
** Your cookies were phenomenal and thank you super much for sharing!
* h0p3
** I handle being let down by people pretty decently considering my history. I respect the way I approach it.
** I love that you help others find resources to bring good into the world - like those videos for JRE for developing good unions.
** I also love that you leave the door open when people walk out (like VC), so they know you're their if they need you.
** And thank you for going shopping with me. <3
** And for going over my Greek with me!!! <3
** thanks for finishing up the door for me, lol.
** I enjoyed watching Shawshank redemption with you.
** With the exception of it's always sunny in Philadelphia, you have excellent taste in media.
** Cooking with you is a treat! Thank you for helping!
*** Thank you for wanting to help. 
** You handle my violent mood swings like you've been dealing with it all your life and you eagerly got all the certifications.
*** I'm sorry. Thank you. 
** Thank you for thinking I'm worth it.
*** Thank you for being worth it.
** Thank you for walking with me. It gives me great satisfaction to walk The Road with joy, love, and the very best of companions.
* ASK
** I've enjoyed working on the mulch and garden with you. I'm looking forward to finding the trees for the trim too. We may have to walk in other paths or even take the vehicle to find them. 
** You work hard to see the best versions of people, fighting PTSD and a lifetime of experience with people who exploit you. Few would dare to even imagine the effort that takes.
** Planning with you for a bidness is a treat. You dive in.
** We had a blast adventuring. Thank you for an excellent afternoon.
** the thrift store adventure was very fun, and i got the craziest hat out of it. thank you. :)
*** Agreed
** It was kind of you to let us keep the spare money had after the thrift store visit.
** Thank you for the clickers! They are fun (and will come in handy at work).
** When in the depths of despair you focus on other people. I think that means you may be a good person someday, if you make it.
