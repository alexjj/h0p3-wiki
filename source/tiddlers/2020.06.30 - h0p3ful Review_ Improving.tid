** I hope you kick some serious ass tomorrow. It's crunch time, and I'm worried. 
*[[My brain and learning]]
** Dope. 
** If "very skilled...for my age" means in the top 1%, I agree. I think that is a fair assessment. Keep it up. You've got a significant headstart on almost everyone. To be clear, I think you are a far more talented philosopher than computer user; you should be too, as that is the skill I have practiced with you since before you could speak. 
*[[Magic Numbers]]
** Sounds like you are having a blast. =)

** If you don't have anything to deliver in appearance, then you've messed up. I don't see any proof of CS work. You must deliver goods in CS and [[Leet Drafting]]. 
*** I'm unhappy that [[Leet Drafting]] somehow doesn't exist. That could be a surprising violation of honesty in a number of conversations we've had. 
*** Do not forget to show me diffs.

** There are many academic philosophers who spend time arguing that you aren't just permitted but even obligated to choose your family member here. 
*** I remember one conference in which 30 PhDs took seriously (most of the room agreed) that we didn't owe another person around the world anything at all precisely because we've never met them. It was some fancy ~~argumentation~~ rhetoric, I tellyawhat.
** While your argument is interesting and related, you've missed the real issue that these words alone confront (I realize you may be attending to a context for this quote). The concern of individualism extends far beyond family here.

** If we take Saint Kant far enough, everything is a UFO at the end of the day.
** I'd be interested in seeing you question the concept of life. That adds another layer to the problem.
*[[2020/06/29 -- Wiki Log: Joek]]
** I [[hope]] that Parmenides will actually be ready tomorrow. You seem like you have a very long way to go after two days of "research."
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** All three practices in [[2019/07/01 -- Writing Log]] have improved over the past year.
