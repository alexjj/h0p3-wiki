Hey! I'm a random internet stranger that had an eerily similar experience: h0p3 left a thoughtful comment that was quite semantically dense on a post of mine (in https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalGardens/comments/mubo61/thinking_out_in_the_open_is_all_well_and_good_but/), nothing too controversial or anything, and now whoosh it's gone. Weird.

FWIW, I'm pretty sure philosopher.life is a tiddlywiki: https://tiddlywiki.com/ It allows lots of plugins and customization and works offline, very powerful.

The moment of space I needed to create has likely partially passed, but I am not unpausing yet in some sense (I am turning Shreddit back on though). I appreciate your witness even of my whole lot of nothing to say, lol (and you may find the file grows larger even if the sidebar doesn't show it for a while starting tonight). Thank you for being whoever you are. I will not forget this name of yours should you ever need to use it with me again.

I really wasn't looking for you for any specific purpose, other to share that video - I think it's amazing the exposure that gives your ideas, but I'm kind of disappointed at the lack of people understanding it.

>>>> You lose me on computing and mathematics, but a lot of your philosophy resonates closely with my own beliefs with very little to no contradiction, and I've gone out of my way to share it with everyone in my circles who cares, and some who don't.

>>> I stand corrected. Sorry. I must have mixed it up with something. The Wise Being articles come to mind.

>> I am surprised to hear you say that. Aside from a few example paragraphs generated through GPT-2 and GPT-3 (among the ~40MB of plaintext), I do not use ML to generate text. I have written some on the matter though, https://philosopher.life/#Aispondence. It's hand-written.

> GPT-3 is a new machine learning text prediction model, which has been trained by OpenAI for a large amount of money (translated into computing power). They're providing access through API in a beta program, in which the author of this site is participating. The author has set a special prompt (beginning of the text) so the model is inclined to generate what a Philosopher AI would have said.

What Is Philosopher.life?

Someone sent me this website and could only find a discussion on this website (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17969843) and on reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/AtrocityGuide/comments/e5mtpe/philosopherlife/), so I'm wondering if anyone has insight.

>>> Well, good job on the site, it looks pretty good!

>> Yes, it is safe for the proletariat.

>> I wouldn't say it is best described as a site with stories related to hacker culture. I am interested in hacker culture, of course, but the site is focused on trying to be a good philosopher (however poorly, I realize).

DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT KNOW IS THIS WEBSITE IS SAFE OR NOT!

Using a throwaway in case the person who sent me it is watching my account (I'm paranoid).

I saw the website had a list of usernames, many from reddit, and when I ctrl+f'ed my account name, it came up with the date the person had PM'ed me on.

I am thoroughly freaked out... can anyone help explain what this could be for me? If you don't want to visit the website, it's basically a ton of ASCII art and ramblings, all super disorganized, but with a ton of content.

Maybe my anxiety is getting the better of me. I hope so.

Edit: I finally found mention of it elsewhere on the internet, these users are acting like it's innocuous, so maybe it's just a scary looking website to a pleb like me: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17977713

Ok so uh, a couple years ago I discovered this really bizarre website. I was obsessed with it. It was super extensive with pages leading to more pages and those leading to more pages, rather colourful, and full of lots of random word definitions, short articles about random things, and strange pictures and a few animations here and there. Black and green seemed to be a bit of a common colour scheme there. The first page had this weird colourful infinite 3d time-wormhole-type animation inside a green-bordered box, the walls of the wormhole thing in the animation lined with numbers. There was also a small transparent animated gif of a spinning 3d Hinduism Om at the bottom of some of the pages. Colourful texts and unusual illustrations were very prevalent. Overall it was a bit creepy but also very interesting. Anyway, I really want to visit this site again but I can't remember the name of it. And, the computer I found it on had been wiped. So. Anyone know what site I'm talking of? (It's not LHOHQ by the way :P)

>>> It's my honor, and I will do what I can. The question of 'what it is' is self-documented. It's an ergodic piece of literature. The advice to search and read is sound. I suggest starting here: https://philosopher.life/#Readme. I'm not neurotypical, and I have hypergraphia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraphia), so I write compulsively. The object is much, much larger than most people realize. It's coming up on 40MB of plaintext, roughly 70 100k-word novels in length, within 4 years. I write about everything ([[WINTCIS]]). Even these words (and yours) will be in my wiki.

>>Not many people notice that it's such a heavy object. Current filesize is ~38MB.

>>>>> I can't say I understand it well enough either. It's simply too big.

h0p3's Wiki Is one rabbit hole ive never heard anyone talk about. and I dont really know how to describe it. links and pages that seem to go on indefinitely and ACII art that are possible codes everywhere. IDK

Its just something you will have to check out for yourself.
