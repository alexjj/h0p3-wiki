Lose myself in something. I'm always fucking lost, I'm just not always aware of it. I suppose I'm less lost when I know I am (first step is admitting it). [[Stoicism-fu]], my ninja: after all the absurd calculations, at the end of day, I have the ability to connect with a handful of people as far down as I can. I'm probably powerless (not that I should give up), but in the tiny flake of our existence, it's what I want to be salient given what is not up to me. I want to lose myself in the people I love. Far from the "is this all there is" mentality. I'm terrible at it though, and it's like I try to make up for it by analyzing (which isn't nothing, and often it's all I got [and it's usually my job]). God damn autist. Yup.

I like that you are reading //THIS// mere-y-ist of mere words (own it, it's yours). In the chaos of my shitstorm of thoughts (and I'm an expert pooper, make no mistake: I make it rain), you sift for the gems. 

Okay, at least as [[PH]], I'm going to write my wife's letter for her because I'm all about the jiggles and giggles (stop reading any time [yes, that includes you daughter, but I'm gonna bet you'll continue out of sheer morbid curiosity, and I like that about you], most people realize just how much garbage I spew and eventually value their time and lives enough to find something better to do [this is the best stand-in for standing-in person available to me that fits my moral requirements {I'd like to think that a hundred years from now, [[ITS]], this will simply be absolutely uninteluhgbul, if isn't already, but it's not to you (and perhaps a handful of ~~losers~~ people I adore beyond all compare [I need another nested sentence here {it's very important}])}]):

Dear TWIMC, Someone Who Isn't Me, &SO&SF,

This is a weird letter to write. Basically, take this person off my hands (2 for 1 specials probably not available, even upon request, but lord willing, I will change my mind). They are a burden to me (I mean, just look at ~~this~~ that [[PH]] letter they wrote, oy [they really just don't understand us, do they?]). I can send you a monthly stipend to pay for the pissjugs (semi-pottytrained), tubs of food and lube, and industrial quantities of superglue for that level of brokenness. Do you even have a basement, bro? (hrm, maybe better not to find out, as I'd be worried there's a terrifying photography dungeon [please make sure to send copies]). Be prepared for his MmmmPatrick* Star RPing.

Godspeed, etc., etc., etc., /[[Zizek]]-sniffle

I think it's a fine start....annnnndddd: published.

Have I solved the equation? Is it really just being there? Could be. Push ourselves through digital sketti strainers to teleport over. Seems replenishing too.

My theory is that anyone who has read this tiddler has simply gone TOO far in life (you are an obsessive person, and I find that extremely attractive). Stop. Get some help. Person, you. I am the solution to literally none of your problems. How do you live with this much cringe?

I like that I get to go crazy in [[/b/]]. It's a safe-ish place to do it. Losing my mind in here. [[Daily mirror yells|https://i.redd.it/fhmu9o0zy4f61.jpg]] are also on my self-help checklist, of course. Edgy, I know. I edge for hours to shoot a few ropes in here. It's my tantric tantrum. I'm having a very hard time understanding the value of being a mature adult.

See, I did it, sweetheart: I lost myself in something.

Tried to stop the world from spinning, listened to my thuh-thumper, and it's just going brrr inside there too. I do like being [[naked]]. I wish I knew how to honor your vulnerability as well as you honor mine.
