** Those who have the natural inclination to engage in the process aren't usually the ones I'm worried about. I doubt much will come of it, but it may. There's [[hope]].

**** Even the analog style we have here goes a long fucking way to [[Know Thyself]] and [[FTO]]. Would take generations to make this common, but I cannot say we that time either. Doing what little I can with what I have.
