Using "comfort" as a standalone justification is a redflag with me (though, obviously even prudential justification holds weight in some contexts).

Any differences between you and an[[other]] which makes your emotional or cognitive responses different can be part of your identity, but not all parts are equally [[salient]]. To fail to address this issue will fail to address how we sell the elevation of gender, romantic partnering, and sexual identity above most other aspects. Insofar as it can be decoupled from [[The Right]], [[Beauty]] will always be commodifiable. It's a spectacle and a red herring, yet another flaw of intersectional crit's unwillingness to admit or actually do anything about being eaten alive by the postmodern problematic. Oh no, something's wrong with me and The World, what could it be? The most effective exploiters in the world are quite happy to see you focus on the wrong problems. Insofar as capitalism fragments our identities to channel desire into the market, the only recourse is to recognize the parts of ourselves that cannot be commodified or remain highly resistant and antithetical to exploitation as the essential aspect of who we are as persons.

Dense, discrete, chaotic system prediction requires more measurement precision in the initial conditions than quantum mechanics allows, more energy to measure, let alone simulate, than the original process, and randomness and real numbers aren't sufficiently computable. You still believe in knowledge, right?

As someone who can't pee while he orgasms (and, post-orgasm's urination is its own profound reward), I want to know if it feels good for those who can. Yum.
