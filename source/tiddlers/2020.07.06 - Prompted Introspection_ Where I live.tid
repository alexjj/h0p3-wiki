title: 2020.07.06 - Prompted Introspection: Where I live

!! What do you really like about where you live?

As is clear in {[[Vault]]}, I've moved plenty of times in my life. I'm a nomad that semi-settles.  [[2019.06.26 - Prompted Introspection: Living the Dream]] continues to improve for now, but that could change. I still live among trees and mountains, and this question is ever timely in our [[urban-survival.tdl]] project. 

I like that I'm in walking distance of our grocery store, and it's convenient to have the other stores around too. Public transport is a meaningful backup. I adore how the walking trail is half a mile b-lined from our home, and it's shocking to see nature preserved in a city like this; that trail has become part of my lifeblood. I like how we are close to MA, ðŸ”¥blazeitðŸ”¥; it's still weird to see a sign for NY. Living in the city has many opportunities, even if I don't use them. The food here is right up there with New Orleans. My neighbors aren't terribly friendly (so hard to build relationships), but the angels are amiable and willing to talk with a weirdo like me. My wife's position affords us the best medical care we've ever had, and there's some safety built into her position (though I cannot say for how long). There's tons of trees, streams, and even some mountains around us. We've not visited the ocean yet, but we've seen it. I like our home.
