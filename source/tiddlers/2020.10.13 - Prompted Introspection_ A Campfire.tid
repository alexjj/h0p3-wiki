title: 2020.10.13 - Prompted Introspection: A Campfire

!! Write about a memory you have related to a campfire.

All the campfires I can remember are from what feel like a lifetime ago. I sat with people from what feels like a different life.<<ref "p">> They didn't really care, and, [[ITS]], they would not really care about the stories of who we were, are, and will be either. There is something deeply insufficient about it, a lack of honesty at the very least. Unfortunately, I can barely remember. I know it's flawed, but I don't trust anyone else there to tell it (and that is one of the real core stories). The stories feel false or tainted (almost pointless) to me in a way. Reflection on what it really meant and what was really happening ends up revealing the painful truth, an illusion I lived in. I feel like I'm watching my memories burn away unless I actively reach into the fire to save them.<<ref "n">> What am I keeping? {{Text Art: 𝕱𝕴𝕽𝕰🔥}}. I feel like I'm in a new act of my play, and I'm going to limit how much time I spend on the previous one. One must wield one's freedom wisely, especially when the world is burning around us.<<ref "t">>

Alright, I'll fish one out of the altar's pyre before it fades into ashes and dust.<br>

<br>> Be Me. ~7yo.
<br>> Mammoth Cave National Park, our first time visiting. We had a spot close to the river deep in the forest. I can still smell it.
<br>> Coleman stove, expensive things I have no idea how they afforded (doesn't seem wise to me these years later)
<br>> Helped build fire.

<br>> Marshmellows & Hotdogs, sitting on the blue cooler, feeling the heat being too much for me
<br>> Saved matches to go with my new pocket knife. Ass-whooped for it? Did I piss myself again?
<br>> Had to change underwear everyday. Why new ones? [[JRE]] and I swapped our stained underwear each morning for several days.
<br>> lvl 99 autist so very well prepared for the world. Also, sorry bro.

It has [[fff]]ingly taken me a lifetime to appreciate what little I do about storytelling and the storytellers in my life. Passwords to our souls are an [[art]] beyond me, but I will do my best. With [[love]] and hate, [[I aim]] to bring it.<<ref "i">>
