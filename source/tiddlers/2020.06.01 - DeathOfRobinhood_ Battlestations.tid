Hey, been thinking and reading about you. How are you doing?
Jun 1 4:30pm
Selah has gone back to work.
Jun 1 4:30pm
I'm hanging in there. Working hard. Protests have me worried.
Jun 1 4:31pm
Awesome that she is back at work. I assume she's glad about that.
Jun 1 4:31pm
How about you?
Jun 1 4:33pm
She is. I miss her during the day, but I'm glad she's out there.
Jun 1 4:33pm
The weekend was a blur of sleeplessness and depression, but am doing good today
Jun 1 4:34pm
Got some sun and a bagel in the morning
Jun 1 4:34pm
It's quite a luxury to be able to spend all day with your wife. I am going to miss it here in ~5 weeks.
Jun 1 4:36pm
I am glad to hear you are doing better. Sun and bagel do help. I'm hearing that sleeplessness, depression, and anxiety amped up this weekend from many people.
Jun 1 4:37pm
How much of your position must be done offline, and when will you end up going out into the world as well?
Jun 1 4:37pm
What happens in 5 weeks?
Jun 1 4:38pm
Sorry if you've told me already
Jun 1 4:38pm
[[k0sh3k]] will probably be heading back to the library. Nothing is set yet.
Jun 1 4:38pm
That's our guess, at the moment.
Jun 1 4:38pm
Oh. I'd be glad if people didn't give up on libraries.
Jun 1 4:39pm
I saw somewhere (your link log maybe?) something about a virtual library that had been built in minecraft to spread stories that would otherwise have been suppressed by governments
Jun 1 4:40pm
Yeah. Gimmicky, but I like the rhetoric.
Jun 1 4:41pm
I try to go out at least once a day. When I'm doing story development, I just need my sketchbook and a pencil. Otherwise I'm chained to the computer
Jun 1 4:41pm
haha
Jun 1 4:41pm
It was really hot last week and my tablet gives off a lot of heat. My arms were becoming welded to the screen I lean on
Jun 1 4:42pm
Do you sketch on the tablet?
Jun 1 4:42pm
I've never had a really nice one, but the one's I've used don't seem to have the precision I'd want (and latency seems bad).
Jun 1 4:43pm
The one I use is actually the studio's. Brought it in for us to use when we moved to remote work. It's a huge cintiq
Jun 1 4:43pm
It's basically a flat screen tv
Jun 1 4:44pm
[[j3d1h]] says those are super fancy. Noice.
Jun 1 4:45pm
We've all been enjoying [[Disco Elysium]], btw. Thank you for recommending it.

Jun 1 4:46pm
I found the table it's sitting on being given away by a neighbour on this street a week before I got the cintiq
Jun 1 4:47pm
It wouldn't have fit on my actual work desk (seen in the back under the monitor and my own tablet)
Jun 1 4:47pm
Heh, I've been following your impressions of DE. I'm glad you're all picking out the stuff that speaks to you.

Jun 1 4:50pm
The magic. It happens here.
Jun 1 4:50pm
Our battlestations. `/salute`
Jun 1 4:51pm
How are you enjoying DE?
Jun 1 4:51pm
I'm enjoying taking my time. I like how it makes me feel like I'm the only person in the world to have had a particular experience. Like I'm some kind of lucky genius stumbling into something utterly novel.
Jun 1 4:53pm
Yes. Also feels eery and magical to me.
Jun 1 4:54pm
I haven't played since last Tuesday because of things. But I'm looking forward to my next playtime
Jun 1 4:54pm
The game is apparently set in a universe that had originally been developed in a novel.
Jun 1 4:55pm
A person I met online told me to take it slowly. I'm doing that too.
Jun 1 4:55pm
The novel only sold one thousand copies sending the author into a three year long alcoholic bender
Jun 1 4:56pm
Ouch.
Jun 1 4:56pm
Whence he reemerged, reinvented and renewed as a game designer apparently
Jun 1 4:56pm
Pretty amazing. Would have to be a novel. I've never played a game with as much detail in the dialogue as this. I'm not far along into the game, so I don't know how anything plays out (I'm avoiding spoilers and metadiscussions).
Jun 1 4:57pm
I assume this game has done way better in the market than his book.
Jun 1 4:57pm
I doubt I'm much farther along than you. I'm still on Day 2
Jun 1 4:58pm
Yup, just started Day 2 myself.
Jun 1 4:58pm
It's received its accolades yes
Jun 1 4:58pm
Anyway, I'm gonna go prepare supper. Thanks for sparing me some time :)
Jun 1 4:59pm
Yessir. We'll have to VC soon.
