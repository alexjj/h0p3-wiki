title: 2021.08.11 - Prompted Introspection: Horn Tootin'

!! What is the an interesting fact about you that few people know?

As usual, I don't know how to pick out the boundaries of "few" here, but I suppose you mean for me to pick a context and standard at-will, Samwise. `/salute`. Horn-tootin' time.

[[ITS]], I've constructed the majority of this ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱. I predict it will remain that way, but we will see.<<ref "i">> I [[like]] my contribution to [[The Great Human Conversation]]. `/self-pat`.<<ref "m">> I wish I had been writing this all along. I wish I had the discipline to have been reading and writing consistently from a young age instead, and I am non-trivially at fault for it! I respect those who have clearly worked hard on such an endeavor. Well, at least I have whatever is left of this gravy to dive as hard and fast as I can. I adore being consumed by my work and taking my life seriously. I feel like I have a new lease on life through it. 

It's interesting trying to see those who have explored it try to explain it.<<ref "a">> It's a hardcore example of being Extremely Online^^tm^^, it's so autistic in its [[PSM]]ing, and I think you've gotta be retarded to build something like it or even interact considerably with it.<<ref "<3">> As I pick out in [[Readme]], it's the construction of a file that is small enough to fit on most hard drives and is meant to be sneakernetted, and I think it will eventually be something worth having on plenty of hard drives.<<ref "p">> I could only [[hope]] to be embedded in a network of people intensely engaged in a similar task.

I don't know what it is, despite [[Know Thyself]] (and my other {[[Axioms]]}), being taken quite seriously. The ante is extreme for being so ignorant; no half-assin'. We'll see what schizosperg this eventually evolves into.

<<footnotes "i" "I do have something to say to everyone, no doubt, but I'm not convinced I should create a [[spectacle]] (as usual, [[FTO]] generates conflicts, and I do what I can to handle them gracefully, [[WINTCIS]]). I'm still thinking about this problem. Face-to-face encounters with [[The Other]], the purest word of mouth, that would be my preference for transmission. Perhaps I should push it actively, more rhetorically, automate the transmission I see in [[memetic warfare]] - but I don't [[like]] that, and I'm not convinced it merits crossing such a line either. At the very least, why not wait? Make it as [[awe]]some as I can. Maybe before I die (as, likely as part of my death), I push those buttons. In the end, it's always different when you enter into the author's story; it becomes ergodic in a hard way.">>

<<footnotes "m" "I am, of course, skilled in the art of [[masturbation]].">>

<<footnotes "a" "And, hell, it's interesting to see those who clearly have zero idea what they are looking at, except by its cover, try to explain it, at least to my eyes.">>

<<footnotes "<3" "You know what I mean!">>

<<footnotes "p" "If you had a tiny piece in our species' canonical Time Capsule (on a b-word if you must, though I think that isn't the correct answer, at least not as they are constructed at the moment), what should it be? How do you compress down, abstract, pack, and process it? How can we transform ourselves with the very thing that we think is worthy of being our vote in [[The Great Human Conversation]]?">>
