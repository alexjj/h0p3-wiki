title: 2021.03.26 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: RIP Loose Seal, Ya Cunt

Woke at the crack of midnight. Missing My Intruder. Grabbed leftovers and my shoes in which someone (my bet is my daughter, all day, erryday) trolled the gremlin with a pebble (r u satisfied, loser?).

Laundry, Both kitty kats came down to be with me!! I rewarded them with crack. YOU WILL LOVE ME! [[TTTOTW]], including Local-[[FTO]]. Perhaps someone is willing to speak at length with me, a hiki like me, their name shall be Shah until I know better. `/wave`. 

Met another human, JD, until I know better, `/wave`, a friendly special ed teacher. Lawd, over the top with this one. Go ahead and tell me about how you scream while getting fucked and belted, lol.<<ref "e">> Pretty sure they were getting off on it (enjoy, homie). Talked about Chicago, teaching as a vocation, and retards like me (I test all patience). This person visits CT a few times a year, so perhaps we can have them over for dinner. I'm doubtful anything will come of this, but who knows?

[[TTTOTW]], Fireman Time!, continued to organize my shit.

She's up! My wife slept. Thank goodness. You should hear her voice, filled with energy again. I know her head hurts, but she's here. Hugs'n'bugs with my daughter. Encouragement. Hit the hay hard.

Woke at god knows, racing and burning brain, Fireman Time! Laundry. [[TTTOTW]]. Found dry erase accessories, distributed. Hugs'n'bugs. Same story, different day; [[CTS]] though. Gracias.

//The Walk// was fantastic. Didn't see a yellow lambo at that cop apologist's house again, but still bonfires around. Saw a kitty kat, persian, extremely friendly, naive even. I always stand back to let my wife approach. She's the one that adores them the most, and I don't want to scare them off (I'm scary). Took a pic of her (extremely rare for me), and she asked me to send it to her. Aight. Wandered, feeling better about things. Begging for my 15 minutes a day on Mark-V with her. Shared a piece of lemon candy. I needed that walk.

Partial [[Family Gathering]]. Offspring and I sat with our laptops at the table constructing [[âˆ°]]. Designing cards is a new thing. Both seemed way into it. We even left the chicken to be overcooked accidentally (though it was delicious), sandwiches, mayo, lettuce/salad. We had so much fun, I didn't have sex. 

Two minutes of hateful //Skintime// (the bed is not that awful, woman, and you can read your nook while I hold you!). Hit the sack by 10, couldn't keep my eyes open.
