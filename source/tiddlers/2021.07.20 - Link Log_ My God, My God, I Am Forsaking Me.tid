*** That's now two opposing of the major monetary policy shapers saying this. If two of my enemies hate it, maybe it's worth thinking about. What if it's just an on-ramp to something else? That would be enough. Still, the only answer requires a kind of coordination that doesn't need that on-ramp because it required so much more cooperation in The Stack. But...worth thinking more about it.

*** This is coming at it from their end, not mine. Don't predict they understand the serious terms of philoshical art here (most sources, particularly those meant for MBAs are absurd on this topic, wildly [[biased]]).
*** Virtue Theory is what many hybrid-scholars turn to for moral-perfectistionic lists of eudaimonic attributes and metrics. That Sen feller is worth thinking about some.
