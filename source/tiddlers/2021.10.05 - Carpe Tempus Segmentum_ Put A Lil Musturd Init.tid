title: 2021.10.05 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Put A Lil Musturd Init

[[ASK]]ing. Perhaps prepping for doing the freeway on a vespa. Airplane and Do Not Disturb modes aren't working (a big deal for her, especially on the road), yet she needs [[music]]. Exploring apps with her before she hits the road. A short fuse with some people; it's interesting. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

Leftovers, queso fresco + tortillas, agua. LPL, my ninjas. RNG is lookin sick as usual. [[ASK]]ing. But for the grace, so to speak. Resilient fighter. I know that addiction. I offer perspective, particularly the crazy painful one. She already knows what I have to say, just needed to hear someone else say it. A sunk cost fallacy, loneliness, and it is my honor to be a source of [[hope]].

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! She's up. I brought her non sequitur mustard (3 times). She kept forgetting what she wanted as she walked through her door. I made her late with XOXOs and breakfast. Also, while she wasn't looking, I wrapped the mustard and snuck it in her satchel.<<ref "w">> :P. I have a very hard time keeping a straight face around her. It's quite similar to how many people can't seem to tickle me, but I'm helpless before her. Of course, she's already mapped her paper outline in her head, and she's two projects used to procrastinate against each other, or that's her rationalization. It's cute.

Dadnap. She found the mustard, and, I quote, "You absolute asshat." =D. [[ASK]]ing. Ice cream. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

//The Walk// with my offspring was pleasant. My daughter talked about her conversations with people, and my son about what he wished he did differently with his day. Rabbitholin' and planning for the rest of the evening. They had a discussion about different mindsets between the poor, the wealthy, and the exceptionally wealthy. Butter(s) shares an almost identical [[Discord]] #ID as hers, so I think this is clearly a sign. She's growing more fun to tease, and I like that we can do it without being too self-conscious or feeling like there's some ridiculous pressure. [[j3d1h: Entity]] didn't actually know her name after this many years. That's odd. She seems to know 10 details about them for every one they know about her.

We worked on our projects downstairs until she was about to arrive. I've done something I've not done in a long, long time, a long time: I bought tickets to go to the movies. Good god, that shit is expensive. It's [[Dune]] though. And, there's, like, a non-trivial chance I'll cum<<ref "c">> right in the theater (I usually do anywho<<ref "t">>). Fell asleep, giving her time with the offspring. Unfortunately, it was very late before we got to see each other. Skincrawling, I was upset. =/. I thought I had missed my window. 

A flash! 

No [[Family Gathering]] tonight.<<ref "m">> //Raw Skintime// and she told me about her day. Meetings out the ass. A's turned into a coffee session instead, and they both have too many meetings.<<ref "j">> Too many useless ones, and it's not clear how to minimize this bullshit. The most interesting one was with the union, and everyone knew everything already; it was just a formal accounting in a sense, court-like. Her excitement about school also adds significant undue pressures on her. I understand that this is a huge deal; game-changing, a {[[dream]]}, and the stars have aligned. I'd feel the pressure of it too. She tore her clothes off. //Inform the Men!// Tears and relief. Meditation. I was going to shower, but the bathroom was fully occupied. If I was going to eat dinner with her, it would make sense to wait.

The offspring did make dinner for us all though. I thanked them. [[k0sh3k]] and I ate together, steak, potatoes, and green beans. I had some water too. Oh, but...our couch was christened, "Bloody Mary." Haha.<<ref "a">> Cleaning and decided an immediate shower made more sense, as it wasn't going to crust over on me fast enough. Then //The Office// + //Skintime//. There's nothing like working with your spouse, but I don't see a viable path to it (nor could I see myself fitting in with this crowd - I don't belong with anyone).

<<footnotes "a" "As usual, my prediction came true on the matter.">>
