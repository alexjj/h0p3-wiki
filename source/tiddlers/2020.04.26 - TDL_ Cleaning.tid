title: 2020.04.26 - TDL: Cleaning

* We need to get the post-sabbath cleaning done.
** 11?
* I hate the state of our rooms. Should I just clean it with them here?
** Can't believe I'm still doing this. I am clearly doing something wrong.
* Transplantation into a section of the garden?
* Missing specialist tools for the bike, try and find a way around.
* What about pulled pork and veggie tray?
