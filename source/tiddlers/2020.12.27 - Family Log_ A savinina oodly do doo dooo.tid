*** I've had a very simple week, and I've liked it. My week has been very fun, and I can't remember the last negative thing about it. I've gotten a lot of presents I like, including a few that surprise me. I've loved doing church from home. Also, my phone works, so yay.
** j3d1h
*** I'm glad you liked your gift! I was worried about it being lazy or something, but there's not much I can do about that for this game. I'm glad you're willing to try out the robotics and calligraphy sets. They both seem like interesting experiments to me. I hope you keep having fun with MTG, you're really good at it! :)
** k0sh3k
*** You had a pretty fun week, I think. You played lots of games in your room, but also played lots of M:TG with your dad and chess with me. I'm glad you liked most, if not all, of your Christmas presents - and I honestly think you'll like the others if you give them a chance. I hope you'll take advantage of the calligraphy set to improve your handwriting. I noticed this week that your reading aloud has improved quite a bit; I hope you'll continue to think about how to read aloud well, and work on emoting the reading as you speak it.

*** [[1uxb0x]] had a great week, and it seems to have felt less like a blur to him than the previous. He got a ton of sleep, played plenty of games, organized his room (buying his own things for his own room), has his gaming station set up (including securing his screen), helped weld his ladder onto his bed, put up shelving with his dad, cleaned the kitchen consistently, has been thinking about where things go and why, doing his laundry and showering, opened lots of presents, continued to practice MUC, sat across from his dad at the table voluntarily for many hours this week, has been keeping his 2-in-1 in the living room, has been thinking about his KVM, mounted his curtains, and has gloves now.

** 1uxb0x
*** Thank you for baking the stuff, it was amazing. Thank you for letting us use your room for the nightmare before Christmas. I hope you'll like your Christmas present. Your room feels larger, but it might not be.
** j3d1h
*** Some of the character sketches (writing) I've been trying to do are turning out well! I should definitely do that more often, especially now that I'm getting more comfortable just expressing/creating them. I've been offering lots of advice to my friends, and generally hoping everything turns out alright for them. I like the way my room is set up now, and I doubt I'll change it a whole lot. Definitely in need of a whiteboard, and I have plenty of computer concerns, but we'll get there.
** k0sh3k
*** Your chocolate cake was good, but the maple bread was fantastic - thank you! I'm glad we found the burning before it got too dangerous. Your room is coming together nicely, I think, although you still have stuff to do. I'm glad you liked your Christmas presents. I hope you put them all to good use! I know you've felt on edge lately, and I'm not sure why; I hope you'll take this next week to relax and refocus so that you're ready to jump back into schoolwork the week after.
** h0p3
*** [[j3d1h]] had a good week, though she didn't feel happy about it. She doesn't remember it too well, and that is expensive (I hope to help her remember as wisely as I know how). She's been making a lot of art (her, [[j3d1h: Entity]], and Pip's avatar X-mas card was sick), and it's clear that seeking and taking [[salient]] advice has been working there (with significant practice). With pain, her room has been put into some order, and it looks to be downhill-easier from here (may she coast to victory). She's considered making murals on our walls,  thought about her life many times with her father, and she continues to seek [[others]] wisely (don't stop!). She got some amazing presents, and it's up to her if she's going to thank folks (and how). Her computing is in better shape (tried to burn the house down, and she's thinking about how she's going to have her nix box up), she bled radiators (and researched problems), constructed many shelves, and ate pork fat by the mouthful.  She played magic, and gave away her old monitor (using the family's TV now). Interestingly, she hosted a party in her room. It was a good week for her.


* [[k0sh3k]]
** 1uxb0x
*** DoOt. Yay, first mortgage payment! That'll get old in less than 40 years or so, (and so will you). Your going on vacation time, yay! I hope it's relaxing. Thank you for letting us know what you want to get. I'm sorry that you miss church so much.
** j3d1h
*** Your analysis of Mary is fantastic, I love it! I'm glad you had a pleasant conversation with your folks. Your cat seems to be far less stressed than usual. I can tell because she's bothering you again. I agree with you on vanilla - it's always confusing to me when people say vanilla is bland. Maybe their taste buds (or their noses) are fried?
** k0sh3k
*** I did a lot of not much of anything this week, and it was nice. I read a //lot//. I also arranged for oil service and paid some bills - I don't think I've ever enjoyed writing a check more than I did for that first mortgage payment! That said, I did have a few days of headaches and backaches, and I had some blue periods, too. I really miss church. I enjoyed wrapping up Advent with the kiddos, and watching Nightmare Before Christmas with them, too. I loved my Christmas presents - all my family know just what to get me. I need to work on sight-reading music again - I've gotten rusty!
** h0p3
*** [[k0sh3k]] has been decompressing. She's catching her breath after an insane marathon-sprint (would make the ancient running-hunters proud), and she has poured herself into reading (bombdiggity, homeskillet). She has handed her wiki off a friend of [[JRE]]s, so maybe a relationship will develop there. Massages and backcracks seemed to help sometimes, as did her anxiety meds, and also working to recognize she did not have to do anything (or as much). She's been getting the house and financial instruments set, and more than she had to (thank you). She made a delicious Christmas meal with the offspring, and she's had the wiseman traveling around the house (in addition to her critically reflective Advent gatherings). She's been reading and watching delicious garbage, but she's also been tackling serious work (I'm jelly). She spent time with her extended family, chilled with and rocked her husband's world, and will never be able to train her cat to sit beside her rather than on her. This week has been just as important as Thanksgiving.

** 1uxb0x
*** I don't think anyone needed to see...that. I've had a lot of fun playing magic with you, but I am slowly getting MTG'd out (I'm not yet.) Thank you for the work on my ladder and bed. You've walked a lot, or I'm just noticing it more. I hope the attic won't be a hassle.
** j3d1h
*** I'm at least 90% sure ideas don't do... that. Also, you're more generally disgusting, but you already know that. You should get a compose key set up (especially since you can make custom combos) - I think you would find it very handy! I'm very disappointed to hear your hands have either taken up neopronouns (with no clue how to use them), or are homestucks.
** k0sh3k
*** We spent a lot of time together this week, playing games and "playing games" and just spending time together talking; it's been nice. You've been working and planning on the house quite a bit, and it shows. Thank you for working on the boy's bunk bed, and for putting the lock on the bathroom door, and for putting up my shelves! While you are curling up more, you've also had some fun silly moments this week. 
** h0p3
*** [[h0p3]] has lived more like a degenerate, and thus he is even more degenerate than usual. He listened to a lot of music (including his wife's). He tried to take over the world (more time for it than usual). Walking was crucial this week. The house continues to congeal for him, and finances seem to be in reasonable order. There's much work to do. He's still curling up; we'll see how that goes. It's been a good week.
