I primarily construct a worldview around repeated rejections of perceptions unfavorable to my ego.

I'd like to know if, accidentally perhaps, a quasi 7 year reconstructive jubilee post 18 is causally connected to the 25 year frontal lobe development mark. Seems unlikely. A jump from marginal political adulthood to a stable autonomous character takes time, of course.

[[ITS]]: Political thoughts no longer than a standard sentence are usually rhetoric in nearly pure form.

If you must have a funeral for my death, please use kazoos instead of bagpipes. Whoever utters the dirtiest, most vile words should receive a prize. Please cum on my grave, in my urn (sharpie on a butthole 4 me), or on the food being served. Bring the saddest or poorest person you can as your +1, and please inebriate both of youselves for as long as you can afford. Get faded, and if you are quasi-goth, please perform your best Gir impression from //Invader Zim// because it would be so random. //Skintime// with 25% of the crowd is mandatory.

If you're one of those people who grades ideologies merely from noise emitted by the average individual who claims to follow it, you'll tend to fall prey to the hallucinations of ideology.
