Hey [[Kevin|Kevin Kovacs]],

It's good see you. 

> It’s been awhile and I know its mostly my fault. 

Naw. Don't worry about it. It's been a helluva year for erryone, and my [[Reply Mode]] isn't always conducive to fostering conversations most people are used to having. I work to maintain parity in most cases. I'm glad that we get to see each [[other]].

> You had asked me about Pinephone and I thought about it a bit, but honestly didn’t know where to start… and continue to not know how to voice an opinion as I haven’t educated myself on what Pinephone really is (as much as I love the open web Linux is still beyond me…) so I sat on it until now…

Ah, well, Loonix and the [[Pinephone]] are beyond me as well.<<ref "a">> I'm still sitting on it too, mulling it around.

> Anyways, just wanted to check-in and see how you’re doing. I pop-in on the wiki from time to time and all appears well, but it’s tough to get a read from the occasional tiddler.

Hard to [[TLDR]] everything. I'm doing well. I live and work in my basement. It's pretty dope. Offspring are enjoying life, and they grind down in [[The Den]] with me often enough. [[ASK]] and [[5c0ut]] have joined us, and that has been [[awe]]some. [[k0sh3k]] is slicing and dicing through the world, practicing her vocation like few do, imho. I know the world is going to shit in many respects, but in an awfully local sense, this has been the best year of my life.

> Lastly, curious what your favorite media things have been this year. I know your libraries don’t go by year, but I love seeing when you drop an opinion about a tv show. Would love to know how you look at movies, tv, albums, (podcasts if you listen), etc. in 2021.

* [[TV: Exploration]]
* [[Film: Exploration]]
* [[Music: Exploration]] isn't defunct, but it doesn't serve the purpose you have in mind, I suggest. //Dreams://[[Music: Library]] contains the "Inductee Minor league feeder pit to the feeder pit" that might be worthy.
* I have utterly failed to find a podcast that will hold my attention. I'm too retarded to listen to them, I think. 
* My [[Link Log]] is my primary media{{Text Art: 𝕱𝕴𝕽𝕰🔥}}.

[[CTS]] logs will have some of that content as well. My curation process is garbage. I pirate and use the web for most of my content consumption.<<ref "i">> It's rare for me to find something that seems to click these days. I think I'm gettin' old or something.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
