title: 2021.03.28 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Oops, A Name

Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. A wild [[Variety Creepy]] appears...Still chatting with Shah, but seems stalled (I have abnormal pacing; I'm willing to spend a few hours to get to know someone at the drop of a hat, and I have the rare privilege to do so). Loners connecting is higher variance event. Ice cream =D! [[TTTOTW]], but going easy. I've pushed plenty fucking hard. 

Fell asleep late, woke up at 2ish? Rumination and Fireman Time! Then [[TTTOTW]]. 

[[Family Time]] was written in blood. We've been here many times. They don't care. Even my wife has decided to stop talking about school with them. Seems like public schools are where they'll end up. We were here last year, but covid saved them. I am convinced they still learn more while homeschooling, that their time is better spent here, that even 5% of this is better than 100% of that. But, I also think the most important things have already been learned, that having this play out (painful though it may be) may be useful to them.

My wife is feelin bad today. Watching her offspring do this, ugh. Letting go is hard.

Called [[JRE]] Back. My brother called for a gutcheck on seeking a maintenance job, taking a union position at Jim Beam, waiting 2 weeks for her surgery, and perhaps his feelings about taking money from the gubmint. People are getting a bit better. Thinking about [[Q]]'s articulation, comparisons. Now he does have to squeeze me in, with offspring of his own, talking to me while picking up food. Sounds delicious. An interesting story he told [[Bn]] and then [[Rb]] about what it means to find people who "never make us feel lonely." I offered my disagreement, and he said I simply think about the matter more than most folks and that he meant qualitatively something else. He asked me how I was doing this week. Yup. Okay.

I burned dinner, but no one was hungry. I salvaged plenty though. [[TTTOTW]].

Surprisingly, a wild [[Outlaw Cheggf]] appears...we'll see what happens.
