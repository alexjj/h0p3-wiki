//WhoRU? [[WWDD]]? I suppose I care less about who said it than I do that we said it together. Let it be known: I come [[to fucking bring it|Wiki Litmus Test]] to NEETshe's nihilism<<ref "e">> among and internalized to you (let me know if I'm smurfing too hard). Of course, some of the most important conversations I've ever participated in were anonymized. It is my honor. Let me show you why we should mix pseudonymity and accountability into the sacraments of our conversations with [[others]]. Can we learn to consistently build trust and [[intimacy]] from anonymous origins? Yes. It's up to us, dearest anon. Through kindness, radical epistemic humility, [[robust communications|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_principle#:~:text=In%20computing%2C%20the%20robustness%20principle,what%20you%20accept%20from%20others%22.&text=The%20principle%20is%20also%20known,an%20early%20specification%20of%20TCP.]], and strict self-discipline in our discourse, let us gently wrangle our tards and convert or extinguish the dark-triads, parasites, and vampires among us. And, [[FTSO]] [[W5H]]? Like madmen wandering the desert, may we find our purpose-together together. May we anonymously give our best to anonymous people.//
