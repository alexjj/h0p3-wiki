title: 2020.06.03 - Prompted Introspection: To Know Our Own Art, We Must Know The Other's Art Too

!! Tell about a cultural clash/experience you have had with a culture other than your own.

I have an annoyingly broad definition of //culture//. All relationships are cultural clashes (even with ourselves). [[2019.02.23 - Prompted Introspection: Culture Clash]] doesn't even begin to touch the problem. I think Reddit is a fascinating example of this. I've jumped into thousands of subs. I'm very clash-worthy. I stick out like a sore thumb. People fucking hate me eventually, and usually it's immediately.<<ref "p">> People hate my face, the way I talk, the smell of me, and everything about me; even those who are ever so nice to me cannot contain their disgust or anger with me forever (I see it in the corner of their eyes). Ego knows ego. Everyone thinks they are different; stand in the same room with me when I'm not trying to be polite, lol. It is rare that I find companionship, let alone similarity with depth. I'm a stickler, an autist, and a person who knows he knows better than you where it counts. What could be more infuriating? In a way, it gives me a crucial advantage in every encounter with every person in my life: I know I am at war with part of who they are (as they are with me, and anyone with anyone when we look closely). It's not that there's not trust, bonding, mutuality, sharing, kindness, but there is a place where peace can only be fought for. It is not a law of nature, it is a law of concept applied in material dialectics.

Community is hard to build.
