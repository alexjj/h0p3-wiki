title: 2021.11.11 - Antipleonasm Analysis: The Future of Meditation

!! Respond to [[the following|Why Not A Wide Area Network, Watson?]]:

<<<
If you meditate for an ulterior motive, that is to say to improve your mind, to improve your character, to be more efficient in life, you've got your eye on the future and you are not meditating. The future is a concept-it doesn't exist! There is no such thing as tomorrow! There never will be because time is always now. That's one of the things we discover when we stop talking to ourselves and stop thinking. We find there is only a present, only an eternal now.

Garbage and hubris. I'm retarded, and even I know you're wrong. I'll agree futureness is a real concept, but not only. Denying the existence of instantiations of the future seems pretty useful for robbing people of empathy.<<ref "e">> I am, of course, open to the claim that time is an illusion, and there's little I can do to provide any certain answer to diffuse the bomb there. I do have my [[phenomenology]], one with a pregnant present sliding into a becoming though (where the future, as part of a category of perception, is always on the periphery), and I don't see how you can deny that condition of experience even from your own perspective.<<ref "i">>

Why should we think your definition of meditation is the only fitting one? Why shouldn't we think meditation comes in such [[dok]]? Why should we think meditation ought not benefit us in any possible case? It is one thing to say that sometimes one must attempt to meditate with as little teleology as possible (and, of course, we are hard-pressed to even reconcile or explain what that means or could look like), but it's another to claim any teleological motivation is conceptually not meditation. There are limits to what it even means to attempt to meditate for its own sake. It is far from clear that one can engage in it [[FTSO]] itself alone; it is not The Sufficient Reason itself. 

I think talking to ourselves and thinking comes in [[dok]], and I'm not convinced there can be consciousness without them fundamentally. Our brains are telling ourselves stories embedded in the fabric of our [[phenomenology]] too. I'll agree that we can attempt to live more in the present, to quiet our minds, and there's a time and a place for this, including in meditation. Your pursuit of the ready-to-hand is still flawed though.

I'm open to the claim that Saint Aristotle's God perceives Itself, The Absolute, The Process of Theology, all-at-once, as it were, whatever this may mean. If it does exist, I am not it, and time is real enough for a mind like mine, including during meditation.">>
