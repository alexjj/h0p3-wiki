"""
04:50:49 PM [[h0p3]]: How are you doing, guest556? What brings you here? Can I be of service to you?
04:54:15 PM [[guest556]]: hello
04:54:28 PM [[h0p3]]: Yo
04:54:52 PM [[guest556]]: can you tell me how to find lists of servers or some good servers to add
04:56:01 PM [[h0p3]]: I add every public server. In the top right-hand corner of my [DarkMX]] client, there's an "+ Add" button, with a dropdown menu to "Gather" more Chat servers (and roughly the same for Networks).
04:57:43 PM [[guest556]]: ok thankyou
04:59:08 PM [[h0p3]]: Left-hand corner* sorry, lol
