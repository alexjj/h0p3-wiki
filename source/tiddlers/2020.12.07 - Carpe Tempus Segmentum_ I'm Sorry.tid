title: 2020.12.07 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: I'm Sorry

* Woke at 1
* Unpacking and thinking about the kitchen
* Apple, water, pizza rolls, whiskey
* //GoT//
* Fireman Time!
* Sleep by 6
* Woke at 10:15
** Felt like I slept longer. Cool. Free hours in the day.
* [[Morning Routine]]
** Finally, a normal routine sans mouthwash. I feel better. The sink down here: totally useful. =).
* Unpacking
* Offspring and I trekked out to the ol' townhouse.
** Was going to hit McD's, but the prices were insane (and it wasn't brekkie...the only meal for that place). 
*** Long discussion about cost model differences between here in CT vs. TN. Wandering. They must give me reasons why, as always.
**** I'm having difficulty getting my son to just stab wildly in the dark with guesses. 
** They had the kitchen and packing the rest up, and I cleaned the house top to bottom.
*** Their speed and rigor was disappointing. Something is better than nothing here though.
**** I know it sucks.
** It's in as good shape as when we first moved in, except the floor that is hers to handle. We'll see. Been fucked before.
** We had to head home because of someone's failure to pack kitchen up yesterday. On the way, the SUV died...in the middle of the road, no steering. Ugh. Two cars pulled over to help, but we were able to start up in neutral (but not park?). 
** Came back and finished. It took 3 hours longer than it should have. 
*** My daughter started a discussion of the evolution of the cringe emotion. Thought about the memetic and biophysiological nature of anger as a comparison point first for her to flesh it out.
**** Definitions of shame, shame culture, disgust, and why I am overtly disgusting on purpose. Sniffing out terrible inferences in humans.
* Called [[JRE]] Back (I missed his call yesterday, =/)
** Mofo is hitting 640mbps! dope
** Babies crying. Can't be easy. 
*** Matthew sounds cute AF (I only hear tiny snippets, but adorable from my temporary end).
*** He's still keeping his chin up and doing alright though. He's floating, I take it. Maybe even downright pleased! He's doing a good job.<<ref "g">>
** Meds aint adderall, sleep is shit, makes him want to puke, gonna see if it werx.
** Talked a bit about //The Asylum//
** He asked about [[j3d1h]] from [[2020.12.03 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: More Packing]]
** //The Queen's Gambit// discussion. Extremely in-depth. My brother understands what is so amazing about this show. 
* //Skintime//
** She keeps promising to bang me (and, yeah, she's knows how much I want that [living in horny jail here {all I can see is pussy}]), but I'm asking her to just hold off. She's got too much on her plate (great if we can, but she shouldn't feel bad about it<<ref "c">>...the week is all kinds of stupid). Get some rest and reading.
*** A very rare treat offered to me. 
** Drank her in. 
*** Someone felt left out: Meow licked my armpit and traded scents. Purr monster.
** S is retaliating for his conservative malicious violation of sane CV19 protocol (shocking for his position, but not given his status signal attempts...it's why he has his job at all). SZ sees it. A is stepping in to help on the ILL centralization problem (good, they should play hardball here). Long-term: seems constructive. 
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Tendies, wedges, apples, hairy navel (literally drunk; tolerance is gone).
** [[MTG]]: played terrible, terrible decks with my son. Timmies, MWEnchantress, Soul Sisters, Treasure Hunt.dec (lmao). 
* //GoT//+Read+Write+Hydration
* Sleep by 11

<<footnotes "g" "A missing [[PH]], Dear [[DeathOfRobinhood]]: I have silently debated about whether or not I am allowed to say these very words (even this footnote has been held with consultation).Â I do not understand enough about the world. I may be entrusted to remain silent about nearly unthinkable thoughts here. I feel duty-bound to say the truth, one that makes me gulp (a gulp I know well). Incoherently, I am jumping up+down in hard to contain joy and yet I'm scared (I have been in this place before). It's eating me up to not say anything. I love you, Ivan, and I apologize that I cannot bring myself to say more about what is precious just yet. I'm holding my breath and praying for the period to pass.">>
