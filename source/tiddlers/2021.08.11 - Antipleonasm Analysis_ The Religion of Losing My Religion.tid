title: 2021.08.11 - Antipleonasm Analysis: The Religion of Losing My Religion

<<<
[E]veryone has a religion, whether admitted or not, because it is impossible to be human without having some basic assumptions (or intuitions) about existence and the good life.

It is almost flawless. I'm enamored. Note, of course, the fetus is human without having a mind as we know it beyond the standard Hard Problem(s) forced upon us by Saint Hegel himself. As usual, swap out "human" for "person," and you find a more fitting context for the sentence; it heals the proposition in this case. And, of course, attempting to being so [[antipleonasmic]], the statement is still too vague.

One does not escape the {[[Axiomatic|Axioms]]} problem of the ground of all perceived being (and hence the ground of all being) nor the [[Positive Disintegration]] process that Saint Kierkegaard picks out for us, [[WINTCIS]]. Religion is fundamentally concerned with a relationship between the [[fff]] person and [[The Divine|The Good]]. Even in one's attempt to deny it, we engage in it; it is inescapable. It is our plight. There is no [[phenomenology]] like Dasein's without it. It's quite a trick anti-realists play on themselves (and [[others]]), to say "I believe X in practice, but when I step back, I know it's just an illusion." All search for meaning, a mystical one, some not as well as they ought (especially myself).

To think about one's own existence, in the present-at-hand metaframing [[infinigress]], Dasein, when it is honest, comes to know that which is external to some [[dok]], not as mere representation or from solipsism. Intentionality begs the question of metaphysics. Yet again, [[Saint Plato]] picks out what the fuck we're doing here like few ever did.<<ref "a">> What matters most, [[nomad]]?
