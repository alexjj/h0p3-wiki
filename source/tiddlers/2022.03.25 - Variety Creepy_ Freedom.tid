"""
[10:21:58] Variety Creepy: YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
[10:22:06] h0p3: Hello. =)
[10:22:09] h0p3: How are you doing?
[10:22:20] Variety Creepy: Pretty good. You?
[10:22:29] h0p3: Grinding away. Can't complain.
[10:22:34] Variety Creepy: I've got 2 more exams.
[10:22:38] h0p3: `/nod`.
[10:22:40] Variety Creepy: Monday and Wednesday,
[10:22:42] h0p3: You feeling good about them?
[10:22:57] Variety Creepy: And that, I'm fucking free. YEH HEARD THAT? FREE!!!!
[10:23:02] Variety Creepy: I'll pass.
[10:23:06] h0p3: Hehe.
[10:23:12] Variety Creepy: That's for sure tho.
[10:23:21] h0p3: What do you hope to do with your future freedom? How long will it last?
[10:23:23] Variety Creepy: I'm passing. Other than that, I really don't know.
[10:23:47] Variety Creepy: 2nd semester is starting like the next day or so.
[10:23:50] Variety Creepy: So Id,
[10:23:54] Variety Creepy: Idk.
[10:23:58] h0p3: Oh.
[10:24:01] Variety Creepy: I don't know what to feel.
[10:24:06] h0p3: Fair enough.
[10:24:08] Variety Creepy: I wanna buy a PS5
[10:24:17] h0p3: =)
[10:24:24] Variety Creepy: Don't have the money yet...
[10:24:43] Variety Creepy: I'm saving. More like 60% saved.
[10:25:02] Variety Creepy: Make that 70%\
[10:26:10] h0p3: I wish you luck in your endeavor, sir. 
[10:26:16] Variety Creepy: Thanks!
[10:26:26] h0p3: You have any other consoles?
[10:26:29] Variety Creepy: I've never owned a console in my entire life, my man.
[10:26:34] h0p3: Ah.
[10:26:42] Variety Creepy: What about you?
[10:27:09] h0p3: I have, yes. We bought used, since they are quite expensive in the long-run. 
[10:27:39] Variety Creepy: That's true. They're expensive.
[10:27:39] h0p3: Switched to PC gaming at 14. Addicted to the mouse and keyboard. 
[10:27:47] Variety Creepy: Ahaha
[10:27:58] Variety Creepy: What about your kids? Do they own consoles?
[10:28:22] h0p3: They had a Wii long ago. We hardmodded it and hooked up an external HDD to it with pirated games.
[10:28:45] h0p3: I've done what I can to help them transition to gaming on the PC. 
[10:29:44] h0p3: Many people experience formative stories through these simulations. 
[10:30:33] h0p3: Back in the day, I was the TV in an interview, preachin' the good news of playin' vidya games (demonized where I lived). 
[10:30:41] h0p3: on the*
[10:31:13] h0p3: I hope it will be a profound existential and educational experience for you, just chill and relax.
[10:32:10] Variety Creepy: Awesome! You gotta let people choose what they want. Some prefer PC. Some prefer consoles.
[10:32:18] Variety Creepy: On the TV?
[10:32:21] h0p3: I don't know why I gotta.
[10:32:25] Variety Creepy: In an interview?
[10:32:28] Variety Creepy: Wow
[10:32:36] Variety Creepy: I wanna see that!
[10:32:38] h0p3: But, I assume you don't want to argue about that.
[10:32:52] h0p3: Lost to sands of time, I assume. 
[10:33:10] Variety Creepy: Have you tried searching it up on archive.org?
[10:33:49] h0p3: Oh, this wouldn't be there. 
[10:34:13] h0p3: It's cool that they've become a place that would possibly have such a record of contemporary events though.
[10:34:31] Variety Creepy: Why do you think it won't be there? It's worth a try.
[10:35:00] h0p3: Someone would have had to digitize it and upload it. This was many years ago.
[10:35:04] h0p3: I don't think it's worth a try.
[10:35:51] h0p3: Doesn't really matter that much to me other than it occurred and with whom.
[10:36:08] h0p3: What do you hope to play on your upcoming PS5?
[10:38:23] Variety Creepy: If the news channel has been doing that, then it might be there.
[10:38:37] Variety Creepy: Hmm with whom did it occur with?
[10:38:49] Variety Creepy: I really don't know. I'm not much of a gamer.
[10:39:07] Variety Creepy: So hoping a Dragon Ball game, a FIFA game and another game.
[10:39:43] Variety Creepy: I saw that Miles Morales game and Gran Turismo. They looked interesting.
[10:39:49] h0p3: Some kids I used to be in youth group with who were all growed up and doing a project.
[10:40:13] h0p3: Many worlds to travel there.
[10:41:30] Variety Creepy: Nice!
[10:42:24] Variety Creepy: I remember in your TW that said that your photo was on it
[10:42:31] Variety Creepy: Where is it?
[10:42:58] Variety Creepy: And really know whether you have that 'punchable' face.
[10:43:09] Variety Creepy: According to me, no face is punchable.
[10:43:16] h0p3: [[h0p3]]
[10:44:08] h0p3: Punchability likely has several modalities, like the word "can."
[10:45:07] Variety Creepy: 

{{Portrait||Wiki: Center ASCII Art Settings}}

[10:45:17] Variety Creepy: Is this the face?
[10:45:19] Variety Creepy: Oh gosh
[10:45:19] h0p3: That's the one.
[10:45:33] Variety Creepy: qTox distorted it up like hell
[10:45:36] Variety Creepy: Hmmm
[10:45:44] Variety Creepy: Doesn't look punchable to me.
[10:45:50] h0p3: `/nod`. 
[10:46:13] Variety Creepy: I don't know, sir. I think those people are weird.
[10:46:48] h0p3: They're something alright.
[10:47:12] Variety Creepy: If you say so
[10:47:40] Variety Creepy: How did you create that photo?
[10:47:44] Variety Creepy: In text.
[10:48:08] h0p3: Don't remember which tool I used, [[ASCII & Unicode Art]].
[10:49:05] Variety Creepy: Oh, alright.
[10:49:19] Variety Creepy: Would you mind sharing an actual photo?
[2022.03.25 - h0p3: Selfie.jpg]
[10:52:46] h0p3: There you go.
[10:53:51] Variety Creepy: Wow, that's a long beard
[10:54:17] h0p3: I like to fidget and stim with it.
[10:54:31] Variety Creepy: Also, I got some notification saying illegals, characters, etc.
[10:54:35] Variety Creepy: What was that?
[10:55:07] h0p3: Might be the colon? Windows and NTFS have some limitations. Probably warned you about renaming it.
[10:55:28] Variety Creepy: Oh alright
[10:57:34] Variety Creepy: Ever thought of trying hair dye?
[10:58:03] h0p3: I have. Always wanted to try the blond eminem look for the shiggles. 
[10:58:42] Variety Creepy: Oh wow lol. Does it suit you?
[10:58:49] h0p3: I can appreciate how people must be concerned about their appearances for signaling games. Consequential reasoning about the limbic systems of others.
[10:59:05] h0p3: Oh, I have no idea. I've only thought of it. Never have dyed my hair. 
[10:59:13] Variety Creepy: Ohh.
[10:59:39] Variety Creepy: My parents have fully greyed but they dye their hair once a week.
[10:59:53] h0p3: That is pretty common in Asian countries especially, in my experience.
[11:00:05] Variety Creepy: Kinda the Sunday/Monday morning ritual for them
[11:00:08] Variety Creepy: Yeah...
[11:00:16] Variety Creepy: What's your natural hair clour?
[11:00:20] Variety Creepy: colour*
[11:01:01] h0p3: A nearly black brown, grey, silver, white, and when I've had a lot of sunlight, some red.
[11:01:35] h0p3: By the time I'm 40, I assume I'll be fully silver except my backhair (probably 50 before I'm full silverback).
[11:01:53] h0p3: Carpet no longer matches the drapes.
[11:02:39] Variety Creepy: Oh, what was it when you were young?
[11:02:49] h0p3: Salt and pepper.
[11:03:08] Variety Creepy: No, I mean, when you were a preteen
[11:03:16] Variety Creepy: The original hair colour
[11:03:22] h0p3: I was blond until I was brown.
[11:04:05] h0p3: It darkened over the years.
[11:04:33] Variety Creepy: Oh okay.
[11:17:38] Variety Creepy: There's a fire in Aramco
[11:17:48] Variety Creepy: An internet friend told me
[11:17:59] Variety Creepy: She was going past it to the mall and saw it
[11:18:12] h0p3: Yikes.
[11:18:29] h0p3: How dangerous is it?
[11:19:16] Variety Creepy: I don't know how to estimate the dangerous levels here.
[11:19:22] h0p3: Fair.
[11:19:30] h0p3: Do you think it was an accident? (https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/3/19/fire-at-saudi-arabia-oil-facility-after-drone-attack)
[11:20:47] Variety Creepy: I remember the Houthi's incident.
[11:20:56] Variety Creepy: That caused a huge disruption and everything.
[11:21:01] Variety Creepy: I really don't know.
[11:21:18] h0p3: `/nod`.
[11:22:07] Variety Creepy: I don't even know what she meant by Aramco.I'm guessing it's the Saudi Aramco
[11:22:37] Variety Creepy: All she said was, There's been a fire
[11:22:45] Variety Creepy: "Near the mall"
[11:22:49] Variety Creepy: "In Aramco"
[11:25:14] Variety Creepy: I googled to see if there is any other Aramco
[11:25:16] Variety Creepy: Nope.
[11:37:16] Variety Creepy: It is the Houthis again

[11:38:58] h0p3: =/
[11:39:33] h0p3: Btw, gotta afk. //The Walk// with my sympaticon has arrived. Will think about anything you say, of course.
