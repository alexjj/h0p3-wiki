title: 2020.08.19 - Wiki Review: Thinking About James

* [[2020.08.18 - Prompted Introspection: Meddlesome]]
** Everyone has a darker side.

** I was in a difficult position with James. Obviously, I have a ton of opinions about what he said and who he is. Maybe he'll see the light. That's the noble way to win.

** Edited. Sometimes I think there is a mirror in here with my offspring. I doubt I will solve the problem well. It's okay. I'm gonna keep trying.

** Completed. I don't think most people would guess that she's autistic. It does present differently in females. Ghetto girl that reads like the wind. Nobody seems to understand who she is well at all; it's sad. 
*** Her offspring do to some extent though. 
** I only have so much sympathy for a Banker.

** I'm excited to see v1.2. This is an interesting way to do it.

** It's hilarious going through his wiki with him. It's hard to believe just how much he's changed in a couple years.
** He's been delivering on the wiki front (even if nothing for my school), and that is a relief. It might actually work out this Fall!
