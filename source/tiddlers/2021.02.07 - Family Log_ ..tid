!! Write a paragraph summarizing each person's week:

* [[1uxb0x]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I've gotten better at magic, but I should stop playing it. I need to stop playing games in general, actually. I was somewhat honest about my school, but not enough. I finished my book for language arts!
** j3d1h
*** Your week seemed to go alright. I'm glad you're still having fun with Affinity! It must be a pretty big change of pace, for a MUC player. I'm glad you're getting to //Blood at the Root// in school. You seemed to really like that book already, so I bet you'll have lots to say!
** k0sh3k
*** @1uxb0x: I'm glad you finished the Language Arts book for the semester! I hope you kick butt on Blood at the Root; and then we can start How to Read Literature Like a Professor for Kids. (Your sister found that one very useful.) I am glad the satin pillowcase works for you, too. You've been doing a better job with your room this week, again - thank you! And thank you for shoveling the snow! I really appreciate it.

** AIR
*** @1uxb0x: I feel like I have seen you improve on your MTG game play. its really cool to see you play against h0p3. I hope  to find something you would like to learn to cook/bake. I think it's a skill everyone should know. ( you can make a lot of connection with people through food.)

* [[j3d1h]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I love the ancient cuswords. Thank you for thinking about me and my school. And also thank you for trying to help me with it. Thank you for helping me with my computer problems. I think you overestimate my intelligence.
** j3d1h
*** I enjoyed the parts of school that I did, which is nice. Creative writing didn't go very well - I'm following the book just fine, but it's hard to come up with somewhere to go when writing. I guess that will come with time. Drawing has been easier, thankfully. I got to mess with Silas's new design, and I'm pretty happy with the hair now (very rare for me)!
** k0sh3k
*** @j3d1h: The work you had in your wiki was, once again, good. I really like your analysis of Ishtar and the barmaid - you should think hard about the role of women in EoG; it's important. I'm glad you're still doing art with friends; the collaboration seems to be good for you. Your list of archaic cusses is really fun! You've been doing a fantastic job of being up and at it on time through the week - thank you!
** h0p3
*** [[j3d1h]]'s words about her school efforts during the week did not match her actions. Her [[Cuss Words]] collection is sarding delightful, there's some analysis of //Gilgamesh//, and she's writing out her terminology for economics. She set up [[AIR]]'s piracy and video tooling. She cleaned her room some each day, and it shows (being asked to do it with the door open seemed to help). Her chores were completed without too much of a fuss (once she got into it, she did it well). She got a lot of hugs in, has been thinking about the stories of her music (seems fancy), shoveled at 50% (nice to see), has been thoughtful about her sleeping schedule, clearly has a cat who adores her, put shelves together, and got some work done on her machines (`/hug`). Overall, she seemed to be in better spirits this week, and there wasn't as much difficult wrestling with her. The climbing continues.
** AIR
*** @j3d1h: I was looking for word to cooking with you hopefully we can get the chance to chill and make something. I like that you like showing your skills on the computer, (you should keep going at it and push for awesome). its was cool to watch you get my computer set up so fast. and with a new program that you haven't used you were fast to pick it up.

* [[k0sh3k]]
** 1uxb0x
*** Thank you for the pillowsheets. Thank you for setting my alarm clock. That was a good game of dominion. Thank you for making sure I did all the basic things I needed to do.
** j3d1h
*** SC sounds awful, I'm sorry. It's appalling how bad people are with computers, even at Yale. Pandemic Times sounds like a fantastic newspaper. AT needs to be blocked from using libraries or something, he clearly doesn't appreciate your work at all. Also, the future better have a solution for head and back pain, or I'm opting out.
** k0sh3k
*** For myself: Such an insane amount of snow, which led to an insane amount of working from home. My regular student staff started again this week, and it was great to have them to get most of the daily tasks done. I'm keeping up with my management class, which is not fun but at least I'm keeping afloat. I was very grumpy and had several pain days this week. I also started using Janus more for personal stuff, although Janus doesn't always play nice and I had to restart her several times this week. I got a lot of reading in this week, too, which is nice.
** h0p3
*** [[k0sh3k]] is absolutely enjoying her management class, and it's clear that she's really learned how to avoid being responsible for completing groupwork for the parasites around her (decades have gone into this difficult lesson). She deals with people that I could not even. She has been irrational (and, I called it, as usual :P), in pain, and feeling pretty ded at the end of the week. Her new headphones have been useful, and she's still reading up a storm.  She has (with growing pains) moved into her new computing home. She beat us in //Dominion// (I'm still sore about it). Non-trivial ups and downs for her, especially regarding her offspring.
** AIR
*** @k0sh3k: You have had a very busy week, dealing with that dude that want a copy of every page with a specific name on it, to "mildly racist"  lady. Im sorry you had been feeling like shit. if there is anything in the future to help let me know. I hope for us to talk more. your cranberry sauce is on point will be stealing that recipe for the future.

* [[h0p3]]
** 1uxb0x
*** Thank you for trying to help me with my laptop. Thank you for pushing me to work on my room. Thank you for checking in on us to make sure we were doing our work
** j3d1h
*** I'm glad to see the link log back! Your /b/ stuff is.. interesting, I suppose. It's very difficult to read what you write, sometimes. Specifically, every time I try, the sentence simply doesn't work or I get too disgusted to read further. Strangely, you act like a professional writer I know, at times. (They just know where to draw the line.) 
** k0sh3k
*** @h0p3: You've had a busy week, working on the house and helping your brother settle in. Thank you, too, for helping me with Janus, who is being a complete bitch for no apparent reason. Thank you for my massage this week - it was very helpful!
** h0p3
*** [[h0p3]] has been putting the home together, fitting pieces together where he can, yearning and curling (an extremely odd mix of feelings [experiencing [[hope]] proper, staving off his unjustified, ugly, stupid fucking pessimism, giddy hanging on even every word in love {doing his best to remain reserved and coming correct despite bursting}]), annoying the living fuck out of people who aren't ignoring him (ha, losers), sleeping well, watching pure garbage LoLvods, giving an interview for a podcast, studying foundational mathematics, enjoying that decaf bliss trim, avoiding getting shit done on his monster, feeling skinhungry AF (crawling out of my skin too), focusing on meatspace more than usual, rapidfire spitting in [[/b/]] (absolutely retarded, I'm so sorry), and he's just going to stay in whatever this mode most likely.
** AIR
*** @h0p3: you have had a long week. and an emotional one at that. Im sorry that didn't get your wiki  and that the pod cast didn't work out well.  I think you will like the candies when they are made. Im glad I get to help you with this. also you're wrong just don't think its said enough lol.

* [[AIR]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I've liked playing games with you. Thank you for making us food. I've not gotten to interact with you as much as I normally do with other close family.
** j3d1h
*** I'm sorry to hear that you're still having a lot of anxiety. I hope it passes (or, at least, gets easier to ignore/cope with) soon. The food (but especially the cookies) you made was fantastic, thank you! Also, I like playing card games in general with you. We should play them more often!
** k0sh3k
*** @AIR: Having you here has been great. Thank you for keeping h0p3 occupied. ;) I'm really appreciative of your offer to teach the kids to do some basic cooking. Your reorg of the kitchen shelves was nice. And thank you for shoveling snow and checking on the car that got stuck out front; you've just generally been willing to do whatever needed to be done.
** h0p3
*** [[AIR]] has been connecting with everyone in the house, staying in touch remotely with folks, seeking dates, working on his room and the house, cooking, trying substances (no idea how flubromazolam didn't fucking touch him), chilling out, playing games with folks, filling the house with his infectious laughter, working on his resume, and finding his place with us. I've enjoyed being able to speak with him in person; I've missed it.
** AIR
*** For me: I have been dealing with my anxiety. its been weird not working and taking a brake. I keep feeling like I am behind and that im not meeting the goals set.( the goal set for me is to  relax). I sent my resume to k0sh3k to help me figure out how to make it more professional and that its reads well.enjoying time with the family!
