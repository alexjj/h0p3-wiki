title: 2021.01.24 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: It's Going To Be Okay

You know what I need for my desk? A Diet Coke button, just like DJT's. Amazing. I would have a sex button, obviously (and not just the one on my body [h i t i t]).

* [[Letter]]-writing.
** I'm hoping [[DeathOfRobinhood]] will understand. He's working to help me. I know it. That dude is a champion.
* Grafting
* [[CDR]]s seem to be squeezed down to [[CTS]] and [[Prompted Introspection]]. 
** I don't like cutting [[review]], but it is technically cuttable. Priority-wise, it goes before the others. I want to be ruthless here. I've been plenty meta enough in that realm. I gotta keep experimenting. 
* LoL+Pizza
* Try To Take Over The World
* Dialectures
* Inform the Men!
* Meditation
* Called [[JRE]]
** Wide range of emotions in him, worrying about Quinn but loving life. 2020 was a great year for him. He says life feels real again. Fuck yeah, homie.
** Said I'm his mentor like he is my [[Root User]]
** Neo-Rationalism discussion. 
** Omegle, he's been meeting lots
** Children are sick from daycare.
** Thinking about the nature of the [[pause]]. 
** Rebecca is super stressed. He's filling in the gaps, imho.
** Losing weight. Addy is working, and I can hear it in his voice/tone/word-choice/inferences (can't put my finger on it well enough).
** I can't remember everything. It was a lengthier discussion.
* [[Family Time]] @ 1
* Coffee
* [[TTP]]s
** In which the adults say the same thing and people claim they will do the right thing and none of us are convinced it's going to get significantly better any time soon.
* //The Walk// + 1-on-1s
** I'm trying to continue to develop a sense of the difference between live and wiki sharing with them. Huge discussions with both on adjacent topics.
** Music, a hat, my hoodie, made it all comfy. Need to wash my socks.
** Offspring prefer their mother always. I am the ugly duckling. Hehe.
* Read The Wikis
** Turns out, there's a fuckton to read in mine. Diff file is just fine.
** Excited to see some actual work (however small) in my offspring's wikis. I hope they will get it together.
** My wife has been writing even more. It's been serving even more purpose.
*** We need to get it fixed on the public side. She has people she wants to read it.
** I'm glad that my family understands what I'm doing. 
* Sleep by 6:30?
** Exhausted. Fluttery heart. Anxiety. It's going to be okay.


!! [[Computer Musings]]:

Fuck me. Pip and Python on Arch just don't play nice together out of the box. I hate this breakage. Updated anyway. Gonna sit on it. Virtual environments might be the way to go here.
