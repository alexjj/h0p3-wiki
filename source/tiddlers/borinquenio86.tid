"""
[11:35:09][borinquenio86] is it alright if I download from you?
[11:55:26][h0p3] Go for it. And, let me know if you need anything else. I'll try and find it for you.
[12:01:04][borinquenio86] ok
[12:06:11][borinquenio86] wheres the comics
[12:06:57][h0p3] In books, I've got Saga and Lazarus.
[12:07:10][h0p3] Highly recommend those two.
[12:10:44][borinquenio86] ok how does it usually take to download 
[12:10:48][borinquenio86] long
[12:11:13][h0p3] No idea. It varies. I usually have my upload maxxed out. 
[12:11:50][h0p3] It's probably best to jump into the queue and wait. There are several people ahead of you.
[12:12:58][borinquenio86] how do I do that
[12:41:50][h0p3] You're already in the queue.
[12:42:38][h0p3] I leave my machine up consistently, and if you leave yours up, it will eventually come down. I wish I had more bandwidth to give. I give everything I've got.
