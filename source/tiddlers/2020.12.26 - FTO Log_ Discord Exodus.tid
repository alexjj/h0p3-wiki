ðŸš©ðŸš©ðŸš©

I've decided I'm done with Discord, at least for now and maybe it will be once a week (unfortunately, some groups cannot be reached without it), but I'm going to shoot for completely withdrawing from it if I can. `/tips-fedora` to [[kicks]], [[DeathOfRobinhood]], and [[JRE]]. Back to the drawing board in the desert.

Still curling up, and it isn't worth the energy. I agree that IMing is valuable for [[hyperconversations]], but I don't see a reason to use this platform (which I've long had problems with, and this isn't my first time dropping it). Among other {[[Axioms]]}, I've not found it encouraged [[FTO]] any more than the other options, and [[FTO]] has been failing too much (not that I predict success either way). Failures to use the wiki have just meant failure, and Discord wasn't a bridge: it was an unspoken (and I think unworthy) [[smalltalk]] compromise in many cases. I am very glad to have given it another try, and I'm going to see if I ought be without.
