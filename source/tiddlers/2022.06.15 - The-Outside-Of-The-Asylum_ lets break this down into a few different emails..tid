title: 2022.06.15 - The-Outside-Of-The-Asylum: lets break this down into a few different emails.

Sorry for my absence, my girlfriend came into town and we got a hotel and all that jazz. The last post was super long so lets try to tackle it one at a time

> "Please feel free to skip the topic (or any*...I'm too talkative a person in many cases, [[nomad|https://philosopher.life/#nomad]]). I'm interested in further understanding your claims here.

> It's fair to say you are Discordian, in the Eris-related sense, I believe. Would you call yourself ascetic? How about [[stoic|https://philosopher.life/#stoic]]? I realize it's difficult to label."

I wouldn't say I'm discordian, it was just a book I found at a used book store when I was a teen. and it definitely was a major influence in my early life. I don't think anyone believes in discordianism seriously, it was just a esoteric joke. I mean the whole erisian idea is just a big metaphor. I think it opened a lot of doors in a lot of atheist eyes. Atleast my own as well as some of my friends. And I wouldn't consider myself either of those things. I think I strive to better myself. But that's a long term goal. Really I'm trying to get my basic needs met. After that I'll let you know.

> "I can't say much to Discordian positions, but I do have a recommendation for you that is perhaps out of left field but may lend some analytic-style creedence to at least parts of the claim that "All statements are true in some sense, false in some sense, meaningless in some sense, true and false in some sense, true and meaningless in some sense, false and meaningless in some sense, and true and false and meaningless in some sense." Sir Graham Priest's //One: Being an Investigation into the Unity of Reality and of its Parts, including the Singular Object which is Nothingness// provides some clean work on some very hard problems (he has several books). [[The Dialetheia|https://philosopher.life/#The%20Dialetheia]] is quite an object to be concerned with, this thing that is both true and false at the same time. I [[aim|https://philosopher.life/#aim]] to be humble about such a thing. It is quite difficult to reconstruct a fair representation, to my eyes. I'm hard-pressed to pick out meaninglessness; I am not even convinced that it would have the meaning we might attribute to it (let alone what it objectively possesses). It may even be a harder problem than the being of nothing."

Your reading list is getting harder lmao. Thats a super academic sounding work but I'll see if I can read it. So I think it's just a matter of perception. I don't really believe in a objective truth (remember, my basic perceptual senses lie to me constantly) but even without schizophrenia I think people still make perceptual choices. I think there is a lot of noise around us in the modern day, you have all the corners of the internet fighting for attention. But there is just as much "objectively" false information as there is information which is true. I don't know many people that read a article, and then go get four references which support the argument made by the article. Much less any which oppose the argument. I think most people tend to be uninformed, and have arguments which feel true. It's a touchy subject but BLM would be an example of this. If you relate the races of people killed by police to racial crime data it's all pretty much within margin of error(police homicide data is super incomplete and not obtained well). But systematic racism is a thing and we could talk about why colored people tend to statistically commit more crime all day long. Or we could also get super racist with it and talk about gang violence. Or we could talk about the war on drugs and what should/should not be a crime. All of these arguments could be true or false or meaningless depending on the quality of sources used. And it's much easier for your average american who is barely able to keep a roof over their head and food in their belly to just gut check things instead of build a argument package you would bring to a debate. See if they feel right and if they agree its true, if not it's fake news. Or worse, wrong think. This has been explained to me as post-truth or emotional-truth. And emotional truths aren't exactly false. They are true to your perspective. They are true to the senses and not the statistician. True to the experiences you have been through.

> "[[Infinite Jest|https://philosopher.life/#Infinite%20Jest]] was probably above my paygrade. I take DFW to be decrying postmodernism while possibly having produced a postmodern work (the result of taking modernism to the Nth degree). I relate to the spaghetti though, and appreciate the chaos. At a surface level, I think my ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 has some in common with this book that required at least two bookmarks."

If I remember right he described infinite jest as meta-modern. Just that, taking the postmodern style to its logical conclusion. I highly recommend you read some of his short papers, "consider the lobster" or "a fun thing I'll never do again". I think I resonated a lot with the themes of pleasure and addiction in infinite jest. I was reading it right as I was starting to get sober. Hope you've been well!
