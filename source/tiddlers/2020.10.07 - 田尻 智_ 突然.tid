Dear Satoshi Tajiri,

I'm sure this letter that you'll probably never see isn't worth your time (I saved you a few minutes there, so you owe me one! ;P). You'll have to forgive me for not knowing what I want to say in this letter to you either! I didn't anticipate I'd be writing it, but, well, now, here I am attempting it. I'm sure you are showered with praise (which isn't to say [[justice]] has obtained), but that is why I want to write to you. 

//Thank you, dude!//

We got some things in common, and I'd like to say we'd get along at least for a few moments. I don't know.<<ref "i">> You'd probably be bored of talking poke-shop with me. It's my connection to you though. So, I'll keep it brief and personal.

I was definitely an outcast when I started playing your masterpiece over two decades ago. It sucked me right in, out of the world around me. Sometimes for better and sometimes for worse, I've chased such a thing many times since then. I think it's wonderful to see this thing you made that signaled that I was a loser turn out to be something that became more acceptable, heart-warming, and delicious for a wider variety of people. Maybe your work was an inclusivisor<<ref "s">> expanding a nerd's tent to something massive. I like that a part of my childhood wrapped up in plenty of pain has become a garden. I realize you didn't intend any of this with me (nor should you care what I think). You made a lot of children happier. I admire how you occupied my mind. どうもありがとうございました

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
