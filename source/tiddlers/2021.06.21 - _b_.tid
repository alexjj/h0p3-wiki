I am, like, SO proud of you for not believing in a self because you made it all up (including the figment model of your agency you are discarding) in the first place. Transcending yourself to find nothing is so enlightened (you do know nothing, Socrates!). `/jazz-hands`. Imagine being so self-centered you'd ultimately rather deny there was a self in the world that you ought to learn to identify with than escape solipsism. We can agree that subjectivity-like-ours requires stitching episodic memories into a partially constructed simulation of a self in a mentalized environment without having to agree that we never experience the world directly to any [[dok]] or that there is no "I" at all. As a [[Straussian]] who agrees that we are all on the hunt for the fitting mysticism(s) (some of us are just terrible at it), I'm increasingly convinced this was Kant's Realpolitik Razor: handing the Humeans enough hypothetical rope to hang themselves as anti-realists, exacerbating the underlying zen dynamics of their woke position into that which merits silence (Wittgenstein may have completed the postmodern program). Never forgetti that if you can't say it positively or positivistically, then it's negative and can't be real. Just believe in the power of positive thinking, okay? Alright, now it's your turn to say I'm projecting an illusion onto an illusion so we don't have to continue the thought-terminating conversation. Go.

Be free, my cringe shitpost [[/b/]]utterflies. For the horde! Stunlock 4 lyfe. Y u m t w a t.

Like a 3-Body problem, endlessly seeking the predictive and prescriptive meaning of the other between two vicious manichaean yinyang models (inaccuracy of being too good, inaccuracy of too evil). Like an Overton Window, I hunt the mean between two plausible-seeming poles. As a HF-autist, I'm a capitalist-generated extremophile sensor seemingly selected to find the cracks to survive in low-empathy environments (and I'm extremely privileged). In my experience, greyrock and strict Socratic method quickly peels off masks to reveal psychopathy (I require //so// much patience that I bounce the less-integrated of these easily enough, teacher), and it's often much more profitable to just avoid me unless I'm trapped (thank god I have escaped these prisons). Machiavellian traits know what my strategy means; it's pointless to try me - I have nothing they want and style they cannot replicate given their egoism. Of the three faces of this factor, I attract and maintain relationships with narcissists the most. Like a show and tell animation, I must write and ride a line between mirror and [[WWDD]]eified-Christomimetics. My job is to be a reliable indicator flashing morse code to and of the other toward...you already know my answer.

ThE LAngUAgE We USe maTtERS. Cool. Agreed. You actually believe it matters in an objective, moral sense, right? You agree you don't completely own yourself in virtue of both of those facts, right? If not, STFU, liar. I can taste the nihilism and egoism in your blood from here. `/spit`. Insofar as they can be peeled apart, you know the price of our words but not the value.

Is this a percontation point â¸®

I put on weight during my depression so that I'm more likely to survive on my own, just in case I would starve or suffer (people withstanding) from food withdrawals. That's my rationalization, conflating my needs and desires. I suppose I should be grateful that I've at least grown fatter rather than politically conservative or ironically self-righteous.

Poverty buys bourgeios happiness.

I think sometimes finding justified [[hope]] is only in virtue of having experienced fear. There's no substitute; you simply cannot empathize effectively enough with trauma, poverty, and exploitation without having been there. Not all suffering and [[dok]] of privilege are equal, and some perspectives have normative priority. While others suffer, you don't have a right not to know it either. This is part of what separates the [[pleft]]ists who put their money where their mouth is from those who are only egoistically paying hollow lip service while seeking validation of their victim complex or ignore it altogether as though they were truly powerless. No wonder the self-described [[pleft]] is so fragmented.
