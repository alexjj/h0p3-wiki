title: 2021.01.26 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Talkative Day, Except With One I Want To Speak With Most

* Woke at 4
** Halfbrained starting midnight. Felt good though.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Missed a mumble session with [[Sphygmus]] last night. Fuck. 
** Disappointed that I missed my chance. Hard to be too disappointed though. After all, she did walk into my room to chill with me. I was just sleeping. Maybe I should get a device set up so that she can pull me out of sleep (or whatever I'm doing). A "tickler" button. Voice is not enough.
** Repo had nothing for today. A sign of something. I hope she's okay.
* Wife made coffee for me. (I had two large cups).
** She's lookin' extra fine today. Good god. I want to drink from her orifices (no matter how much it disgusts her, unfortunately...it's so weird that she has no idea how hawt she is...she's always saying I'm the only one that looks at her like that, but I know that's not true. Intoxicating. [[Sphygmus]] is the same way for me. That's awkward, but it's true...I'm so fucking confused right now.). 
* In virtue of My Witness, I looked on Twitter for `https://philosopher.life`. Lol, there are people who have mentioned the site (and, it is clear that [[kicks]] has championed my work again and again, on many sites; they are exceptionally generous). Neat. 
** Thinking about belated responses here.
* Discussion with a friend of [[ASmith]] about chat.
* Chats with lots of folks.
** Sat in VC with this Kent Palmer fellow. His work is daunting. Holy shit.
*** That entire server is filled with literal geniuses (it's expanding, might be 15 now). They put up with my retardations well enough, even gave me a few pats on the head (good job, tard), wrestled with me a bit. I'm grateful. 
**** Hate to say it, but I think they are working on a dead end. Gorgeous. Almost toward instruments that practically matter. Maybe it will change. Rebel scholars. Go forth. Take 'em down.
** [[K]] read through olvoldies. Thinkin' about it with me. 
* Video Chat with [[AIR]], saw [[JRE]] too. We are all bearded fools.
** Showed him the room, asked if there was anything I could do before he arrives. Tomorrow, hopefully!
* Hrm. I've now prepared for 3 VCs.
** I'm doing //such// a great job at managing this [[FTO]] thing. Lawd. Look, I want to hear their voices. 
*** Why can't I have everything want? That can't be too much to ask. Right? :P
* Laundry
* A game of [[MTG]] with my daughter. Less snappy today. More hugs than usual. Illegal MUC vs Affinity, gave her +1. Absolute stomp. Who knew double sapphire drain acall shackles would win games?
* Bugging offspring on work
* Try To Take Over The World
* Fireman Time!
* Motherfucking Snow. I'm still not used to living in CT. Been here for a year. You'd think it'd've set in muh brain. No, it has not.
* Try To Take Over The World
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Girls are dead. I don't know what happened. Dudes are cracking jokes, slinging cards, and they have their heads on the table.
*** Chalkboard came in handy as we talked about what MUC with 4 Mox Sapphires should evolve into...
** [[MTG]] gobbos vs MUC. Eke it out.
* LoLvods
* Fireman Time! Interrupted
** [[Sphygmus]] chatted a bit with me. My heart raced for 15 minutes (infatuation, of course), and I went to type about 10 times, and decided not to say anything. I want to spill my guts every time, of course. I have lots of guesses about how she's feeling. Better not to remove all doubt of my foolishness. I'm savoring even the quiet presence and a smile.
*** Of course, I'm delusional. I'm sure I'm seeing sparks where there are none (I'm the insane one). I can't help it. I'll even savor the delusional. It's part of dancing and singing.
*** I wanted to say I was reading her repo and that I sent an Extremely Vital message to her letterboxes.org address. These are all things she'll figure out in time (or already very clearly knows `/giggle`)
*** She's on her last thread. I'd put her bed like I did [[k0sh3k]] tonight, if it I could. I'm still learning what to do when she's at her limit. Wish I could hold her.
*** I didn't say it to you tonight (I'm trying not to initiate, not to get in the way, even [[K]] agrees I'm doing the right thing). I'll say it here because I need to say it: I love you. I have no idea how to describe what it feels like to not be able to say those words or feel like I can't or shouldn't.
**** I've held a lot of people today. I think that's the best part about my level of retardation: I get more hugs than most schizoids. 
* Try To Take Over The World
* Back to bidness. =)
