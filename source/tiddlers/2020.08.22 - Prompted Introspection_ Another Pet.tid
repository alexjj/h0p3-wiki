title: 2020.08.22 - Prompted Introspection: Another Pet

!! What kind of pet would you like to have?

Thank you, Lady Melisandre. I will stray away from the obvious answers that would net me huge amounts of cash or absurd opportunities (oh, look, this is my dinosaur).

A healthy, docile, sleepy teacup [[kitty|Kitty Kat Korner]] that I could build a carrier to live 95% on me. I would like to carry it around with me, feed it snacks, and pet it all the time. I'm not much for wanting to clean up after other animals though. My wife, of course, would adore the creature.<<ref "t">> I think I would also get along with a small mouse. Unfortunately, I don't think the other cats would get along with any other creature we kept in the house. They regularly drag things into the house to give to my wife in tribute (though, Chairman Meow usually brings a leaf).
