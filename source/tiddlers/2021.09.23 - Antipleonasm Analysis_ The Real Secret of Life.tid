title: 2021.09.23 - Antipleonasm Analysis: The Real Secret of Life

!! Respond to [[the following|Why Not A Wide Area Network, Watson?]]:

<<<
This is the real secret of life - to be completely engaged with what you are doing in the here and now. And instead of calling it work, realize it is play.
<<<

I do not consider being present and gamification to be //the// real secret of life, but there's something to be said for that claim, no doubt. It is //a// key to unlocking justified eudaimonia in some contexts,<<ref "y">> though not everyone is [[lucky]] enough to have the opportunity either. Note that there are many exceptions as well. Not everyone can play or afford to enjoy the present, and I think it is wildly overprivileged to claim it can be. Do I detect a whiff of prosperity gospel in here? Maybe. I suggest your sheep are unlikely to be sufficiently critical of the claim as well.<<ref "t">> That's not just [[stoic]] reframing. You're ignoring the plight of perhaps most humans on the planet who are alienated from their own lives, labor, and basic rights of personhood.<<ref "a">> 

It's not like I don't appreciate the part of the sentiment that is accurate and worthy. I know how to be present to a non-trivial degree, and I think it's terrible to have life just pass you by, depressed, derealized, and anxious about a past and future without having just been there in the moment, fully immersed, eating it up with a spoon. I'm an autist.<<ref "z">> I have a difficult time escaping anything except what is present in my rich, sensitive, high-bandwidth [[phenomenology]]. I throw myself into my work and my vocation in a playful way too.<<ref "w">> Not all people can though. I think you not only have to work for a justified vocation (it's not acceptable to simply do any kind of work, nor turn any kind of work into play), but you have to win some lotteries to get there too. I will admit, however, that most people do have at least a few hours in their day where they get to reframe their work, to enter the flowstate, to recognize that our suffering can have profound meaning, and to [[CTS]] or at least salvage what we can from our situations. [[ridtyawtr]].

I suggest you're prescribing to people that they be more selfish, hedonistic, egoistic, and even anti-realist. That's the real secret to your claim, and that's my problem with your work.
