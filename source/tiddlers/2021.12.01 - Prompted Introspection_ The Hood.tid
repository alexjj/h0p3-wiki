!! Where we come from has such a strong effect on the person we are. Describe the neighborhood you grew up in. What was special about it? What was challenging? How did it shape who you are today?

Due to my donors' explicit choices, in virtue of their [[faith]]s, we lived between ghettos and simply poor areas (both urban and rural) until I was 12, where we happened upon suburbia, still relatively poor (though we had a computer, a vcr, some consoles, and books). I have generally been among the poorest among my every day peers until I hit Thailand, though I have been extremely privileged in many other respects. Much higher rates of schizophrenia for people who've undergone what I have, and I eat as fast as people from the depression era. 

The neighborhood I came from in Chicago had constant gang violence, drug busts (pigs DGAF, lots of needles everywhere, even in Louisville), etc. Our home was broken into several times, and there were death threats (one time a butcher knife slammed into a post right outside our door) too. I know a rich kid when I see one (and, by my standards, I am quite wealthy compared to the vast majority of humans on the planet), and I'm hyperaware of what resources people had and what they've chosen to do with them (I size some people up with significant accuracy, and often know their fingerprints and form within a few hours of studying). Thailand was another level of poverty, and most of the world lives at that level. That's who we're fighting for.
