title: 2020.07.10 - Prompted Introspection: Source of Inspiration

!! Talk about a source of inspiration for you.

I'm changing the question from [[2019.07.03 - Prompted Introspection: Public Figure]]. I don't wish to quibble here. I appreciate the spirit of the question (though I still don't know how to refine it well enough). Ideally, I'll pick out surprising (even inspiring) answers, but we'll see where it goes.

Ants, bees, and spiders are inspiring to me (all of which come in a wide variety). I can't recall off the top of my head why, but I have seen thousands of little stories about them.<<ref "f">> I do not consider these Daseinic creatures, but when I squint, it feels like it. They are shocking to me as the most intelligent birds, naked molerats, and honorary vertebrates. There's something extreme about them that gives me pause. [[TOP]] is concerned with just and effective hiveminds. Watching technology attempt to mimic life is often neat, but I feel extra weight in the value in ants, bees, and spiders. I feel somewhat [[hope]]less in trying to understand these creatures, and similarly, that makes the task of understanding [[Humanity]] seemingly impossible. I am glad I try though.
