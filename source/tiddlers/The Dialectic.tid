The whole is the true.

The only thing that is certain is that whatever you may say of this procedure, someone will accuse you of misunderstanding it.

Further, we find upon closer investigation that the two poles of an antithesis, positive and negative, e.g., are as inseparable as they are opposed, and that despite all their opposition, they mutually interpenetrate. And we find, in like manner, that cause and effect are conceptions which only hold good in their application to individual cases; but as soon as we consider the individual cases in their general connection with the universe as a whole, they run into each other, and they become confounded when we contemplate that universal action and reaction in which causes and effects are eternally changing places, so that what is effect here and now will be cause there and then, and vice versa.

None of these processes and modes of thought enters into the framework of metaphysical reasoning. Dialectics, on the other hand, comprehends things and their representations, ideas, in their essential connection, concatenation, motion, origin and ending. Such processes as those mentioned above are, therefore, so many corroborations of its own method of procedure.

Nature is the proof of dialectics, and it must be said for modern science that it has furnished this proof with very rich materials increasingly daily, and thus has shown that, in the last resort, Nature works dialectically and not metaphysically; that she does not move in the eternal oneness of a perpetually recurring circle, but goes through a real historical evolution.

When you meet a contradiction, make a distinction.

Being and Nothing are sublated by Becoming. [[The Right]] and [[The Beautiful]] are sublated by [[The Good]]. 

So...

Subject and object are sublated by? Part and whole are sublated by? Truth and absurdity are sublated by? Necessity and contingency is sublated by?

I have no idea how these are related.

There is an "ought be" and "ought not be" (two kinds, from what I can tell). Hegel buys you the "is" necessary for the "oughts."
