The cope of [[h0p3]]: hyperfixating alone in my room, caught between two worlds, where reality is one of thousands of tabs I keep open in my self-indulgent maladaptive paracosmic {[[dream]]} browser (itself growing self-aware).

You are gonna have to own up to it folks. If we are to own the means of production, it means we have to host the expensive content too (in every sense). Hosting a TB is something at least a billion people on the planet could pull off. Also, you can see why I think text is superior prima facie.
