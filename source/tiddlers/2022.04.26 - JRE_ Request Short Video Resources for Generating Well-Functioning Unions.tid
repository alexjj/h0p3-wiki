>> Thank you! `/salute`

> It’s always a struggle Brother. Try AFL-CIO Twitter, tik-tok and look to your international union for content and for help with messaging. Also use labor history moments, holidays like May Day. Events happening by your state AFL-CIO . Start a “Member Monday” feature or your coworkers. Ask those members that are involved to do a quick video of why they are a union member. Also the Rick Smith show and Labor History in 2 minutes podcast. Here’s a good start. https://twitter.com/laborhistoryin2/status/1374384177089372166?s=21&t=-9yjtRfCKAixtTADTV9J6Q
> https://twitter.com/aflcio/status/1519705443177742340?s=21&t=NM7al38E9Ouy1twA0vscIQ

>> Neat. Thank you.

> [ATUN YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/channel/UCSmgFWZzQkKeWM6GOT_LzpQ)

>> That is a good point. Thank you. Done.

> I don't have resources for you but I think this is an important question. You might want to try posting in /r/antiwork, which is strongly pro-union and may have more traffic for you. Keep fighting the good fight!

>> It's not a large union, and technically there is weak collective bargaining. The union is puppeted by management. I'm considering helping us transition to the IBEW, but I'd like to try to work with what we have first.

>> Thank you for your excellent advice too. We are working on getting our communications off company property (which is heavily monitored).

> ">"My union barely exists"

> What is the name of your union? Do you have a collective bargaining agreement, i.e. A contract that is voted on by the union? If this is a formal union then you should be able to reach out to your national office for assistant.

> [Here is a short video made by the AFL-CIO to share why union membership is better than going at it alone.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yDoMgOzPAM&t=34s&ab_channel=AFL-CIO)  

> If you want to start a union in your shop then you need to find the correct union to represent you.  Simply google 'your trade/job and union' and the correct union will most likely come up.  Remember don't do this on company equipment or on company time. At least in the beginning.  Don't let your employer know what you are doing until you are organized and ready for action. They have access to everything that is done on their computer equipment even if it was done away from the work site.

>> Straight-up, I'm looking for Tiktoks too. That's a great idea. People do pay attention to that medium.

> You need to make a TikTok.

> Unions say whaaat

>> Thank you. I appreciate it!

> [Here’s the AFL-CIO official video.](https://youtu.be/5yDoMgOzPAM)

> It does a good job presenting the statistics of how union membership leads to better working conditions and compensation.

>> This is fascinating. Thank you. I'll take anything you're willing to show me.

> Would you like for it to be some weird dated 1980s esque stuff with silly acting by government employees, because the NLRB got you covered: https://youtu.be/PoTqFolk1Yg

>>> Awesome, hope it helps.

>> Unions in general, my friend. Thank you. This is excellent.

> These are some short videos on unions that I looked up on YouTube. Are you looking for IW union stuff or unions in general?

> [What are unions and how do they work](https://youtu.be/al5N_5TvFOA)

> [why unions matter to you](https://youtu.be/402m57yFjTM)

> [The 5 biggest corporate lies about unions](https://youtu.be/UwwymqpS45c)

>> Lot of demand of skilled tradespersons, especially as the boomers leave their industries. This is an opportunity to negotiate for better working conditions in many areas.

> In NYC and NJ they're desperate to hire guys and apprentices for multiple unions.

>> I appreciate that. Thank you for letting me know.

> I'm not a fan of union

>>>> I know your pain. I had similar trouble when I lived in TN. I've had the most luck in less rural areas too. It's alright if you don't work for a union; you might know of worthy videos or literature in any case.

>>> I don't work for a union so I can't help you.. unions around me are pretty dead to.. a bunch of guys I work with left the union bc they were always getting laid off.. wasn't sure if it was just bc they suck or what the deal was.. I think they're just stronger in big cities, which I don't live in.

>> You aint dumb. You are correct too. Yes. My "union" is non-functioning. It has been hollowed out and management essentially puppets the union about. My co-workers have no real idea what a union should be and what it is for. I'm looking for any kinds of videos that you may think are relevant to the topic to aid me in helping us talk with each other. It would be nice if we had some shared references and resources as well.

> I'm dumb.. I'm a little uncertain of what you're looking for.. you are currently in a union and want videos to show the people you work with what a union is?

>>> Send the IWW an email, they will help you organize whether you all are members or not.

>> I've seen some in my wandering, but I don't have any in particular that have stood out to me. Do you have any you recommend in particular?

> Have you checked the IWW's resources?

>>> Idk if they're good. I've only been in a few months

>> We should all be so lucky to participate in a good union.

> I'm part of the SMART Union. sheet metal, air cargo, railroad and transit. I have no idea how tin knockers got mashed up with longshoremen but whatever lol

>> Reminds me of a book I had to read to join my union long ago. I like this a lot. Thank you.

> [Here's ](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIs0vlsyJ9NQ3G-0Q-HCBsCwpEmNv-eRZ) a history on labor unions from yonder yet. You can view these and distill them for your brethren as you see fit.

>>>>> np

>>>> You keep them, my friend. I appreciate the offer.

>>> If you could use them I can send them to you I mean I'd be dum not to promote my trade.

>>>> That is wise. Thank you.

>>> Shit never really had the problem i get ironworker magazines from the international ever 3 months. Maybe throwing them on the lunch table will make someone pick it up and read a bit about what our unions worldwide do. (Job size location wages rules benefits political thoughts of it all)

>> They are unlikely to read a website, sadly. I do not claim their ignorance isn't their own fault to some extent. I live in the US. I am trying to educate, and part of the fitting way, it appears, is with videos.

> Just show them strong unions website ? What country you in? Whats the problem they want to work non union and make less coin with no benefits? Idk to each there own but I wouldn't get out of bed for any less than I make at work. Just educate.

>> This is dope. Thank you.

> https://youtu.be/a-0gxca-VxM
> Here's a union buster video.

>> Thank you so much!

> https://youtube.com/channel/UCGO45s4uJR_XARRppZFC1_g

> Some love him, others not so much.

> The beautiful thing with ideas... good or bad they start discussions.

> This is just a source. While I agree with most of his topics, you may find this is not the right stuff for your purposes. Review first...

>>> Best thing I ever did as a bargaining unit chair was use unit funds to hold a social gathering at a tavern where I handed out copious desktop flags, buttons, and other UAW schwag and members got to meet the regional business agent. It helped a lot.

>> Indeed, friend. I agree. That is crucial, necessary, and irreplaceable.

> This is where having face to face conversations or social events come in handy. The key to organizing is building relationships.

>> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxhOF1D2fpo is pretty cool. I appreciate the recommendation. Thank you.

> I don’t have anything super specific but for some 101 type stuff I highly recommend Second Thought on YouTube, and if I remember correctly he’s done one or two videos on unions, hope that helps

>> I'm posting it in lots of places trying to get whatever perspectives people are willing to offer.

> You posted this in the IBEW subreddit. Why?

>> Gracias. I think you're right about that.

> Looks like your coworkers are visual learners. Good thing I have a [video](https://youtu.be/402m57yFjTM) here just for that. Good luck on your union!

>> I've not checked that subreddit, and I am now. This is fantastic. Thank you.

> Have you checked out r/leftisttiktoks ?

> They might have some suggestions.

> https://vm.tiktok.com/ZTdVyYK5k/

> Might be something like what you're looking for.

>> Thank you. I appreciate your advice. 

> Call your local union of any trade or job and ask them for help, almost all major unions have someone just for this purpose and can guide you most of the way. This isn't a plumbing thing and isn't something we can help with here.

>> I've had a couple dozen people help me so far. I'm grateful.

> This is really cool what your doing. I hope someone can help you out.

>> I don't understand. What should people tell me?

> Ah. I see no one has told you yet.

>> I've some Tiktok, Youtube, and Vimeo videos, and a variety at that. I'm still collecting, then I'll be able to sort. I think Tiktok may be ideal in many respects here.

> Hey have you checked out TikTok for this? Instagram and TikTok get the most views these days so I imagine there's some content there that you could find and send along? I don't like this as an option, but it's the best one I can think of.

> What have you found so far on YouTube?

>> Excellent. This is another piece to the puzzle. Thank you.

> Labor notes! Not a video I know, sorry. They are a journal and a training organization to help people revive dormant humans. Check out their website and especially come to the conference in June in Chicago if you can. They have some incredible very simple straightforward books about Reviving your union

> Very good idea. I don't have any suggestions but I like your thinking

''''

> I don’t, but good luck brother. That’s a fantastic undertaking.

> Unions need more members like you.

>> Thank you. I appreciate it. I'll take all the help I can get.

> More perfect union on YouTube perhaps will get you started

> [Robert Reich's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=402m57yFjTM) on the importance of unions is pretty good. There is [another one in his series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSralhrpK44) which may be relevant for you too.  

> [CA Teamsters has a short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jOX86eMyGs) about the importance of union membership. It may not be 100% relevant to your workplace, but it's a pretty straight-forward explanation by a union man. 

> It's not exactly on-topic, but may be entertaining to watch for you and your fellow workers: [John Oliver's segment about union busting.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk8dUXRpoy8)

> u/fieldslave and u/inuma might have a link or two...

>> I hadn't even thought about that. Thank you.

> I think music was used a lot more in the early 20c. labor movement. Check out the songs of Woody Guthrie, The Weavers, and Utah Philips, and try to think of a way to express similar ideas in music in lyrics that the working class could understand. That's what the early 20c. labor movement did and the early 20c. labor movement was able to reach a lot more people and gain a lot more popularity, even w/ the middle class. 

> A lot of the current nonsense began when the boomers were sold on sex drugs Leary and rock & roll. Began a thelemic wave that saw the U.S. *kultur* become obsessed with self-gratification. By Nixon admen, PR people, image-rhetoricians, ran politics. 

> 1. You are the best person.
> 2. The best people do this.
> 3. \[                                           \]

> Try and turn ad-slogans against themselves, like the old union song people did during the early 20c. labor movement with gospel lyrics:

> *If you fight hard for children and wife,*
  
> *Try to get something good in this life,*
  
> *You're a sinner and bad man, they tell,*
  
> *When you die you will sure go to hell.*

> *You will eat, bye and bye,*
  
> *In that glorious land above the sky;*
  
> *Work and pray, live on hay,*
  
> *You'll get pie in the sky when you die.*

> *Workingmen of all countries, unite,*
  
> *Side by side we for freedom will fight:*
  
> *When the world and its wealth we have gained*
  
> *To the grafters we'll sing this refrain:*

> *You will eat, bye and bye,*
  
> *When you've learned how to cook and to fry;*
  
> *Chop some wood, 'twill do you good,*
  
> *And you'll eat in the sweet bye and bye.*

>> Thank you. That is a fair concern. I can't say that the union we have is anything more than a puppet for management and those even more powerful. It is only a hope.

> If this stays pinned through Wed morning here it may get seen and some responses...

> There is a big cross section from far left unionists to conservative blue collar unionists to hopeful progessive activists that could.maybe offer up some stuff.

> I am a bit more jaded, having witnessed and experienced the co-option and corruption to useless or even predatory of many different unions in the US from the early 80s to the mid 10s. So I am well past the cynical wait and see mode many feel and deep in the tools of govt and corp power to control workers with carrot and stick forced collective trash results then MAKING PAY FOR THE PRIVILEDGE OF BEING POWERLESS DRONES. But maybe you can do better than my gen did on unions... just do not be naive or trusting about it all.

>>> You don't need Lenin for union building. Likely to scare regular people away.

>> Some, but I can't say the people that need to be reached would be likely to care much for it. I will take it under advisement.

> Have you tried reading Lenin?

>> Outstanding. Thank you.

> [Labor Notes](https://labornotes.org/training)

>> Thank you for the advice. Much appreciated.

> Join the iww

>> Thank you.

> r/antiwork has a pinned video of union basics, I think that should be super helpful

>> I appreciate that. Thank you.

> Sorry I don't have the short videos, myself, [but these guys might](https://workerorganizing.org/support/).

>> Excellent advice. We're taking both approaches.

> I would recommend that instead of an email or video you should talk to them about it yourself during lunch or breaks. That way you can start a dialogue and answer any questions they will inevitably have. Of course, if you don't feel up to the task for whatever reason, then short videos are the next best thing.

>> It's a bit of both. It is a union that has been hollowed out my management, puppeted around. Fellow workers don't even know what it is supposed to be. 

> Are you trying to actively unionize your workplace or do you have one that's recognized by your federal authority and need help running it?

>>>>>> =).

>>> Best of luck!

>> This is stunning. Thank you. You've given the best answer I've found. And, I agree with your assessment about the lack of media resources on the matter. I'm hoping more will come about, but perhaps we will have to make our own too.

> The type of content you're asking for, i.e. practical advice for members of a union, doesn't seem to exist at a good enough level of quality and quantity as far as I can see, and I think this would be an area for some progressive youtubers to work on. One of the union expert youtubers I saw also complains about the fact that good union training is severely lacking at the moment.

>> Thank you. This is a route we may take.

> Try emailing business associates from other larger unions. I went through a course in my union about why they are needed and how they help. I'm with Ironworkers local 721. You can google the union and browse the site, maybe my BA ( business associates) could help you with some material.

> I’m impressed with the Insulators union and their membership engagement. I’ve seen information on career training, safety, rights, and representation. I’m not a member of Local 99 but they had a colourful layout of salary standards and benefits.

>> This is excellent. Thank you. `/salute`.

>> Thank you. I appreciate it greatly.

> Labor Notes has lots of good resources for organizing within business/service unions (what we in the IWW call all the mainstream unions, because they treat the union as a business and as a service for workers.)

> The IWW's way of organizing centers on conversations between workers about the issues in the workplace and what to do about them, rather than abstract info about unions. Being an IWW member and a member of another union is called "dual carding." If you're interested in organizing the IWW way, our experience says that what works is basically ignoring your existing union and doing the same things you'd do if there was no union. If you'd rather work through the existing union in your workplace, I'd definitely recommend Labor Notes' books and trainings, and if you're interested in the IWW strategy and are a member, look in the GOB for the Organizer Training Committee's report and reach out to them about joining a training online that will take you from where you are now to having a committee of coworkers who use direct action to get the changes you want to see at work.

>> Deeply unfortunate. =(

> Most workers don't even wanna Unionize

>> Thank you.

Hello, folks. I'm a brother in need of assistance. My union barely exists; it's only a union in name. My fellow workers are unlikely to read (many can barely use a computer, if they even own one). They are far more likely to pay attention to a video than an e-mail though, and they'll share videos with each other and talk about it together (as is common during lunch or a break). I need videos for everyday, average people to increase the odds they'll understand unions and related topics. Does anyone have any links to worthy resources they could put in the offering plate I'm passing around here? I'll take any resources, including text. I need help helping people even understand why and what they should care and hope for, and this would be a useful tool.

Indeed. This is dope. Thank you.

>No problem! Glad to help. It's definitely awful not having fair representation

>If you are looking for anything specific I'll try to help as well

>I'm in the exact position. It's hard to get anywhere when you don't have much for representation. I've been collecting many articles and resources as possible for negotiating. I'll send you some info with everything I have found. Good luck

I appreciate it. And, should you ever need someone to speak with about anything (literally), you should hit me up. I'm an odd duck. This is me: https://philosopher.life.
