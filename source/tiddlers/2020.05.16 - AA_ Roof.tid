How are you doing?
Apr 16 11:42am
Working on school stuff ðŸ˜Šbut doing ok
Apr 16 12:01pm
Got the majority of the roof on the coop last night
Apr 16 12:01pm
How are you?
Apr 16 12:02pm
We are similar boats, lol. Working on school and growing foodstuffs.
Apr 16 12:08pm
Awesome on the roof too! That thing is coming together.
Apr 16 12:09pm
How are [[AG]] and [[UJ]] doing?
Apr 16 12:16pm
They are good â€”[[UJ]] thinks he has a sinus infection (or corona when he is having a moment) but we have a store of fish antibiotics so he is taking some
Apr 16 12:17pm
I know fish antibiotics....but its the same chemical so what does it matter...
Apr 16 12:18pm
/holds-breath. I am very glad that we are all young.
Apr 16 12:18pm
He is fine â€”no symptoms like corona
Apr 16 12:18pm
You gotta use what you have available, makes sense to me.
Apr 16 12:18pm
Who wants to go to the dr...bleh
Apr 16 12:19pm
Good. I would be somewhat surprised if you all didn't eventually get it. You work with hundreds of people, pillars of the community.
Apr 16 12:19pm
Yeah, I hear that.
Apr 16 12:19pm
We've been to the hospital a couple times (they have our pharmacy) to get [[k0sh3k]]'s meds...that place is in absolute lockdown.
Apr 16 12:20pm
I bet
Apr 16 12:20pm
Last time I went, the nurse was so nervous, she was shaking as she interrogated us.
Apr 16 12:20pm
Gonna try for a tiny garden here. I do not anticipate success, but it would be cool if we got something.
Apr 16 12:23pm
If anything grows, I'm hoping it's the tomatoes.
Apr 16 12:24pm
I started some seeds inside
Apr 16 12:26pm
Waiting until the freeze threat is over to move outside
Apr 16 12:26pm
The green bean plants are huge! The rest are growing slowly
Apr 16 12:27pm
Woot. =)
Apr 16 12:29pm
We should probably start them inside too. Weather is volatile, and it can still sometimes snow even in April here.
Apr 16 12:30pm
Yeah I got those Jiffy trays at Wally world
Apr 16 12:30pm
They are super easy
Apr 16 12:31pm
No mess
Apr 16 12:31pm
Yeah, that is what we should do. Thank you.
Apr 16 12:31pm
The lid functions as a greenhouse of sorts and they donâ€™t really require water while the lid is on
Apr 16 12:33pm
Ours have gotten too big to leave the lid on
Apr 16 12:33pm

Apr 16 8:48pm
Woot!
Apr 16 9:38pm
That thing is looking solid and fancy.
Apr 16 9:38pm
Gonna last forever.
Apr 16 9:38pm
Thanks
