title: 2021.07.13 - §: A Prayer For The Newborn

;§1

To my blind eyes, your [[husband|DeathOfRobinhood]] practically walks on water. He says you are an eternal well in the desert. I am filled with [[hope]] that the three of us were able to travel to see your baby. It is my honor. 

;§2

When you two first got married, I made my first [[Kintsukuroi]] pieces for you. I don't know how to celebrate the birth of your child any better. Here's one for her.

May we heal what is broken and value gold only insofar as it heals what's broken.

;§3

I judge magicians by how they interpret the meanings of many constructions in the world of magic. Some objects teach us the nature of [[magic]] more clearly than others. `/this` one was initially built for [[my wife]], and I see that it fits your [[dad|Be A Good Dad]] too, and I [[hope]] it suits you above all. If there was ever a deck that Jesus would play, I think it'd be this one. It is a Pacifist's deck. It teaches us the boundaries of magic and why we play it. What is the [[good]] of this practice? What is this for? [[FTSO]][[W5H]]?

May you use it to terrorize your cousins and hug your uncle. In it are ~~mana~~snow-covered lands, symmetric draw effects that benefit [[the other]] before us, resilient defenses against many darker arts, and a Mox Pearl for [[luck]] and [[hope]]. I don't know what you will face in the world; if you ever need money, sell it (and the chants and scepters and rare artifacts too). Do not hesitate to visit [[us|Contact]], even as a thief in the night. May you [[silence]] the world with t0 wins and opening hands like [Mine, Temple, Scepter, Chant, Leyline, Mox, Plains].

;§4

If at all, this may be an old medium by the time you can use it. It's certainly possible I'll be dead before you see these words on this microchip (if you ever do). I know it is highly irregular to receive a piece of writing like this one from someone you've possibly never met. I'm sorry it's weird. I don't know how I can be of use to you (maybe I can't, often I am not). At the least, consider me, dead or alive, a hail mary special forces team player in your life; if you need to think about some crazy shit, feel free to shoot it with me.

May we [[embody|Embodied Cognition]] the two greatest commandments.
