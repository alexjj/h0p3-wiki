* Mathematical and logical truths must be true unconditionally; 2 + 2 equals 4 even if there are no intelligences or minds to think it.
* Mathematics can be derived from logic.
* Naive set theory is paradoxical: the set of all sets that are not members of themselves is and is not a member of itself.
* Epistemology is paradoxical: the set of all sets that are not members of themselves is and is not a member of itself
* A true belief is not knowledge when it is deduced from a false belief or a fallacious process of reasoning.
* All words that possess meaning do so by denoting complete of simple, abstract or concrete objects.
* There are particulars (objects, etc.) existing in only one place at a time, and universals (qualities, relations, etc) existing when there is no corresponding fact.
* A true belief is not knowledge when it is deduced from a false belief or a fallacious process of reasoning.
* All words that possess meaning do so by denoting complex or simple, abstract or concrete objects.
* There are particulars (objects, etc.) existing in only one place at a time, and universals (qualities, relations, etc) existing in more than one place at a time.
* We infer the existence of physical objects from what we are directly acquainted with, our 'sense data'.
* Transitive and asymmetrical relations are irreducible to properties of terms, as the quality of imposing order among terms is lost.
* Since relations are external to terms, reality is composed of diverse entities bound but not dissolved into wholes by external relations.
* The world consists of a complex of logical atoms and their properties and relations, forming the atomic facts which, in turn, form logically complex objects.
* Inferred entities (e.g. physical objects) are in fact logical constructions (fictions) formed from the sense data (improved by science).
* Analysis results in a logically perfect language consisting only of words that denote sense data, universals, and logical consistency (words like "or" and "not").
* A sentence can be meaningful (and true/false) even if a description in it fails to describe anything, and ordinary proper names are disguised descriptions
* The world consists of a neutral type of substance of just one neutral type of substance which is neither exclusively mental nor exclusively physical.
* The sensation we have when we see a patch of colour is that patch of color; and since sensations are not intentional, they are non-mental
* Things are bundles of co-existing properties; there is not a substram as an unknowable 'this' distinct from and underlying its properties.
* Empiricism uses principles of reason that cannot be proved by experience; induction involves a non-empirical logic principle, known as a priori.
* The notion of causation is a relic of a bygone age; the equations of physics have no need of causes and effects.
* Vagueness is a matter of representation (language); it is a mistake to attribute vagueness to the world simply because our language is vague.
* Desires, emotions or passions are the only possible causes of action; reason is not a cause of action but only a regulator
* Ethical knowledge is not possible and ethical statements are not fact-stating; they are optative or desire expressing.
* A great deal of harm is caused by the belief in the virtuousness of work; the road to happiness lies in an organized diminution of work
