title: 2020.09.05 - CeeJay: Schooling

"""
[10:28 AM] h0p3: Just checkin' in with ya: you doing alright? I assume you have been pretty darn busy.
[9:15 PM] CeeJay: oh yeah, new job has kept me off the damn internet as a whole for the past rmonth or so now
[9:15 PM] CeeJay: Very happy though.
[9:16 PM] CeeJay: Commute is an hour each way depending so I have some much needed offline time to catch up on my reading/writing etc
[9:16 PM] CeeJay: yourself? corona keeping you on ya toes?

[10:21 PM] h0p3: That's insane, and I'm glad to hear you are very happy.
[10:21 PM] h0p3: I can imagine those two hours are a great time to think.
[10:22 PM] h0p3: I sometimes have a hard time staying awake on long commutes.
[10:23 PM] h0p3: Thinking about the world has been expensive. I'm not a terribly stable person in many respects, but corona has not affected me too much directly. I am extremely reclusive though.
[10:24 PM] h0p3: You growing increasingly accustomed to the area you've moved to?
[10:26 PM] CeeJay: It has its benefits. I mean, the two trains and bus I need to catch each way has all kinds of crazy characters but most the time there are little to no people on the commute. Wearing a mask all commute/shift and then commute again is no fun though. I'm a bit of an introvert myself so the whole social distance thing has many perks for me also. It is just fine to move seat on the bus nowadays, for example.
[10:26 PM] CeeJay: And yes, at this point I'm more than familiar with my neighborhood
[10:26 PM] CeeJay: The commute has given been an adventure also.
[10:27 PM] CeeJay: I always leave for work hours early so I can get off and take a look around some of the more appealing places.
[10:27 PM] CeeJay: Lovely part of the country all round
[10:27 PM] CeeJay: What did you mean by expensive?
[10:28 PM] h0p3: It costs me a lot of time and energy.
[10:28 PM] h0p3: There is a great deal to read and a lot of feels to feel.
[10:28 PM] h0p3: It affects what how I interact with everyone too.
[10:30 PM] CeeJay: Ah yeah, I know what you mean, The commute is perfect for reading, but I need to spend some time in the graveyard near work afterwards to think it all over. Maybe write down some stuff too. That is where most my diary stuff goes down, trying to get into the habit.
[10:30 PM] CeeJay: Perfect place for it too. Beautiful graveyard with some private areas, not that many folks pass through anywho.
[10:30 PM] CeeJay: Rain or shine a graveyard is a nice place to be.
[10:30 PM] CeeJay: Momento Mori and all that
[10:31 PM] h0p3: Yup. I can appreciate that. Makes sense to me.
[10:32 PM] CeeJay: I forget, are you in Boston yourself?
[10:32 PM] h0p3: Real close. New Haven, CT.
[10:33 PM] h0p3: You are free to visit me anytime, btw (or meeting somewhere in the middle). I know the timing is likely wildly inappropriate, but maybe whenever you are up for it.
[10:33 PM] CeeJay: I ask because school being in is kind of spooky. The commute got much tighter (although still roomy I suppose) since the 3rd.
[10:33 PM] CeeJay: Sounds good!
[10:33 PM] CeeJay: And yes it may be lol but surely one day.
[10:34 PM] CeeJay: You should be fine in New Haven no? Not as much schooling there?
[10:34 PM] CeeJay: Not sure, havn't heard of it honestly.
[10:34 PM] h0p3: They appear to be extra cautious (and privileged) in how they are opening up.
[10:36 PM] CeeJay: True, at least they are taking strict safety measures in opening school. Lots of dumb kids are getting kicked out for attending/throwing parties. Rightly so I would say, why the hell would you go to a frat party with 30+ people unmasked and doing god knows what with who knows who>!
[10:37 PM] CeeJay: A few kids have been made an example of in this way already so I hope everyone gets teh message
[10:38 PM] h0p3: It is not an easy problem. Despite trying to understand it, I am underqualified. I am primarily concerned with the poor kids here.
[10:38 PM] h0p3: This area is lucky from what I've seen.
[10:39 PM] CeeJay: I fear what I don't understand, so while I feel like a fool for even wearing my mask, I'll do my part in order to keep things from getting worse at least.
[10:39 PM] CeeJay: Some areas are luckier than others
[10:39 PM] h0p3: Ah yeah. Wearing a mask makes great sense to me. No doubt.
[10:40 PM] h0p3: I don't wear one on my walks, but distance tends to be much greater than 2m between me and anyone else.
[10:41 PM] CeeJay: Yeah I take every chance I get to at least slide it down.
[10:41 PM] CeeJay: I mena... I would never use it in the car lol
[10:42 PM] h0p3: Aye. I don't use it in my vehicle either.
[10:42 PM] h0p3: There are places you won't catch me without one, but there is a rational balance or mean to achieve in various contexts.
[10:43 PM] h0p3: Is your lady enjoying BU?
[10:44 PM] CeeJay: She just started and has yet to go to a class in person but she is very familiar with BU already and the online stuff is a hoot anyway so yeah haha
[10:44 PM] CeeJay: very much so
[10:45 PM] h0p3: I love school.
[10:45 PM] h0p3: It's my favorite kind of work.
[10:46 PM] h0p3: It's my honor to be able to homeschool too.
[10:46 PM] CeeJay: I was never one for school, for complicated reasons, but I can't wait to go to college. Everything prior is just... weird.
[10:47 PM] CeeJay: That is cool, homeschooling is gonna be VERY popular soon I bet
[10:47 PM] CeeJay: i cant imagine the work that must be though?
[10:49 PM] h0p3: I love post-secondary school* - but, I can imagine a lot of complicated reasons to not be for schooling before it (and, I still have profound problems with post-secondary institutions). I consider most public schools available to youth to be prisons (https://philosopher.life/#Afterschool%20Teaching).
[10:50 PM] h0p3: I am curious to see how perceptions and practices in homeschooling will evolve around the world.
[10:50 PM] h0p3: It is expensive to homeschool well, [[WINTCIS]].
[10:51 PM] CeeJay: The schooling system is a joke for the most part, in my experience. It is truly worth the effort of getting into a decent school. After seeing how my lady gets treated on the merit of her simply going to BU alone is astounding. Let alone the perks that you get from the school itself. Their resources are to die for, and I hope to exploit their library as soon as I can through her.
[10:52 PM] CeeJay: I don;t think homeschooling will be what it needs to be until the next generation.
[10:52 PM] CeeJay: But I hope we make moves to legitimize it further sooner than later
[10:52 PM] CeeJay: This corona situation would be better for it no doubt.
[10:53 PM] h0p3: If you are in need of anything that can be pirated, do not hesitate to ask. Please. I will do my best to find whatever you want (even if you think it's dumb or too much).
[10:53 PM] CeeJay: Within the first week of schools being opened in FL, at least 9000 kids got infected.... So I don't even want to know what damage that did to their families.
[10:53 PM] CeeJay: I appreciate it!
[10:53 PM] CeeJay: Some stuff might be worth pirating.
[10:54 PM] CeeJay: I have a digital library for my other server which is to do with mythology. I'm going to make one also for the Philosophy and Religion server once I have time to work on it.
[10:55 PM] CeeJay: It's done through MEGA so I'll let you know :ok_hand:
[10:55 PM] h0p3: FL got hit crazy hard.
[10:55 PM] h0p3: And CV19 isn't even the worst of the problems.
[10:56 PM] CeeJay: It's not even funny how crazy things got there... And so fast.. And pretty long after the pandemic even got serious. I don't know what happened exactly, all I can say is that I am not at all surprised, sadly.
[10:56 PM] CeeJay: I gotta blast my friend but it was a pleasure chit chatting.
[10:56 PM] h0p3: `/salute`. TTYL.
