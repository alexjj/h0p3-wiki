title: 2021.08.26 - Prompted Introspection: Enlightenment

!! What do you think enlightenment is?

Ugh. That's like asking me to define wisdom or philosophy. Doubleplusugh. Lawd, it's gotta be done though. `/nod`. Disclaimer: all the caveats, etc., and so forth and so on.

I'm a contextualist who agrees that [[TOP]] maxims (wherein epistemology is a subset of moral philosophy) can be maximally particularized without losing their unconditional universality. Enlightenment is the fitting step(s) from one's position. Wisdom is obtainable, both theoretic and practical (which don't peel apart as nicely as we might skeptically assume). Enlightenment is a neverending process available to persons, just as the [[infinigress]] of justification and representations of the thing-in-itself imply the ladders and turtles go all the way down. The job of the philosopher is never complete, though we can be justifiably satisfied with what we've accomplished in a given timeslice. Enlightenment is the pursuit of that which matters most [[irwartfrr]].
