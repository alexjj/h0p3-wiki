!! Audit:

* Allstar [[title.Title]]s. Pure tweet garbage. Y u m.
* I have to mouseover for half of these now. 
* Heavily [[BAGD]] and [[FTO]] related, with [[CTS]] spillover. 
* Some of these moves are simply the most "ephemeral" of the [[CDR]]s.
* Letting go of your offspring and letting them fuck it up has been painful.
** It's been good for both of you though. A lot of dynamics have been changing for it.
* Sad to see [[chameleon]] drop off pretty hard. =/. [[DeathOfRobinhood]] to a lesser extent. I've been the one curling up the most, I think.
* Sleep went into a crazy spiral. Game over, man.
* I much prefer the slow-roll of grafting [[Chatlog]]s. It's more manageable. 
* I take on significant emotional labor, and I'm not skilled at it. Maybe one day I will though.
* There is a celebration of the small things in here. Whispers of many feelings too.
