title: 2021.09.26 - Family Log: She Didn't Name It Because She Is A Loser

!! How has your health been this week?

* 1uxb0x
** I didn't have any health problems or anything otherwise outside the norm.
* j3d1h
** Normal. Probably need to be getting more sleep, but not by much.
* k0sh3k
** I've been ok, except that I'm starting to feel foggy again - having a hard time remembering the day by the end of it. Probably bottomed out my Vit D again, ///sigh// Also, some sort of rash on my neck which maybe I'm allergic to h0p3? 
*** That's not even fucking funny.
**** Made me laugh. 
* h0p3
** My upper gums and nose have been cut, and they hurt. I don't understand. Sleep is going more haywire. Cool story.

!! What was interesting to you last week?

* I finished Project Runways and Lucifer this week; Lucifer made me cry and I liked it a lot. h0p3 would despise the whole series. 
* I made a thing for CA! I hope he likes it.  
* It's Boot and Scarf Season!!!
* [[ASK]]ing and Lightning Strikes, Walking, Spending time with mi amor: my week has been dope.
* I've killed Etherpad on two different networks. I think it doesn't like me. 
* The Last Spell is a VERY interesting game, saying that, hey h0p3, if you see this, I'd try that game out, I wonder if it'd be up thy ally.
** It looks like a blast. I want to. :P. You're just teasing me at this point.
* Far more downs than ups.
** Music affecting my mood too much, probably something to bring up with a therapist. :/
* Found a less stressful form of RP. Hooray for actual character development and expression?

!! Outside of our immediate family, who did we have significant social interactions with? 

* KW, SJ, FMC, CA, WalmartLady

!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family (including ourselves)?

* 1uxb0x
** I think I've tried to get better at the games I've been playing-for the most part, anyway.
** I enjoyed talking to you about the graphic novels you read; thank you for having them ready to go when it came time to take them back! 
** I'm loving your world-building work. You're both flexible and logical in how you write, which is very valuable.
** You are the most likable person in the house (and, you know it's especially strong when nobody is offended by the claim).
* j3d1h
** I think I'm being relatively more open about my emotions.
** Thank you for planning to play tf2 with me, even if you couldn't as we learned later.
** Thank you for agreeing to my art requests! I'm glad to plan these with you! 
*** Happy to turn these into paid commissions if you want. Keeping thinking about it.
** Your consistent care for Butter(s) is special to me. It shows me you are becoming a person who serves others. He has no idea what kind of friend you are to him.
* k0sh3k
** I am getting better at recognizing when my mental state is off/fuzzy and thinking about why and how to fix it. 
** Thank you for pushing us to get books at, and go to, the library.
** Thanks for letting me snatch your books when I feel like reading them. :)
*** Lemony Snicket is too good to pass up...
** Despite not believing in yourself enough in many cases, I admire the fearlessness of your ambition to take on the responsibilities of the world. You know you make a difference in the world, and you do, even though you are always worried you're not making enough of a difference. Your anxiety is a special sacrifice, but you know why and I respect you more than I know how to put into words.
** You've been more animated and dramatic this year, like I haven't seen in a long time. I think you have more energy lately, definitely more optimism. You've worked really hard to build that place up. 
* h0p3
** I attempt to be useful to other people who would build a ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±, [[WINTCIS]]. Some of hardest problems are not technical at all or are what enable us to pick out which technical problems are even worth working on or prioritizing. 
** Thank you for guarding my "me" time, even when you'd rather keep me with you. Also, I like having you see me off in the mornings. 
*** I hate you. :) 
**** Hnggggngngn. =)
** Thank you for helping me with my computer.
** Thanks for steering us away from some uncomfortable conversations with others on our walks.
