title: 2021.08.04 - 5t3v3: Session in Session

"""
Hello h0p3, this is Steve from Omegle.  (Iâ€™m hoping this is you, and that I have successfully set up Session correctly) Just when the discussion was getting good, we got disconnected last night/early morning. I hope we can continue conversing here without being cutoff like last time.
Yo!
It's good to hear from you, homie.
I have to tell you up front that I don't have a way to verify that you are who you say except through Resilio Sync. It is possible for someone paying attention to my wiki to attempt to impersonate you.
Oh, I guess I could post the Resilio Sync key to validate myself?
I'll take that.
[[REDACTED]]
Gracias.
How's your day been going?
I've been a little busy, but overall not too shabby
and how about you?
Tired. Been a good one. Lots of time with the fam. Probably dinner and //Arrested Development// here soon enough.
What'd you work on?
I've been working on digitizing some family photos, which has been a tedious process
Neat. 
What's your process like?
(I don't work with pictures very much)
Essentially I am laying down 2-3 pictures on a flatbed scanner and just waiting, but the scanning time is quite long
but, while I was doing that, I got a better chance to look at your wiki, and I have to say I was really impressed
I didn't really get a good look last night on account of my being sleep deprived, and it's quite the resource you having going on.
Thank you. I'm glad you like it. If you ever want to build one, I'd definitely read it all. 
Great place to lose one's mind, hehe.
Yeah, I can barely manage a basic nomie journal type thing, but I can see what you mean
Also, I realized last night, I never did reciprocate the question of what do you do for a living?
I'm a Leet NEET neckbeard, basement-dweller. I speak to people online. Write [[Letters]], inject myself into some conversations where I have something I'm willing to defend that I consider morally [[salient]], try to model what I think is fitting in online discourse, engage in the Socratic method with those who are interested, etc. I'm a retard who goes around talking to people. =)
I also [[homeschool]]. 
Run my household.
I am a [[lucky]] man to have the vocation I do.
I've had a lot of jobs, but nothing that seemed to matter to me like this one. Aint nobody gonna pay for a madman in the desert to try to figure out how to help The City.
That awesome, seems like your really enjoying it
kinda off topic, but you seem quite knowledgeable in philosophy(judging by our conversations and of course your domain name). For someone who has never really gotten into the discipline, do you have any recommendations on where to start?
I've only vaguely gotten into surface of philosophy, but it has always interested me. I only know the high level viewpoint of a small selection of topics, of which I have only learned due to overlap in other topics, such as psychology.
You might find the philosophy subreddits and Discords useful. SEP is the best resource I know. Reading primary sources is valuable to some degree, and I would recommend reading Plato, Aristotle, and Kant. It's hard to engage in philosophy all by oneself, imho (though there are places where that is all one can do). 
I think learning broadly is also pretty crucial, though many academic philosophers won't claim that is so necessary.
I have a very pointy perspective (some consider me quite dogmatic). I am happy to wrestle with you, but you'll have to take everything I say with an extra grain of salt. Some people find it to be a mere [[game]], but it is not for me. 
Thanks, I figured you might have some easy to digest material due to your homeschooling experience. Is there any particular Subreddits/Discords for a beginner?
If you need a starting question, I would begin with: what is wisdom? why is it valuable? Keep asking the [[W5H]] questions. 
They get to wrestle with me every day. That's the real difference between what my classes are like in a university setting and homeschooling. 
[[Reddit]] and [[Links: Discord Servers]] have many of the locations I consider [[salient]]. 
Awesome, Thanks again
Have you ever taught in a university setting?
Berea College and LSU while TAing. Tulane for my PhD
I teach it quietly in other settings, as a high school English teacher and as a teacher in Thailand. 
and [[Afterschool Teaching]] too, when we lived in TN.
Every person I encounter, I'm here to do philosophy with them.
You seem to have really made your way around the education system
I adore school. =)
Well, I adore what it can be.*
I have a lot of negative things to say about the institutions I've participated in. 
I adore learning, but not school
I appreciate that sentiment, no doubt.
Could I pick your brain about that, sometime later? As an up and coming undergraduate student, the entire upper education process seems daunting
Absolutely. I'm here to talk. 
Thanks,  I'll have to take you up on the offer, maybe tomorrow once I organize my thoughts, questions, etc.
