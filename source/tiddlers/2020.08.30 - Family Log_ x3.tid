*** I've been losing a lot of baby teeth, so free books! I feel like I don't understand what system I'd believe in, and I'm still working on it. I love making things more from scratch and just not researching it, which is kinda bad. It's bad because I could save a lot of time, but it's also fun! I think my week has been good other than sleep.
** j3d1h
*** Your work is pretty great this week! I especially liked your science notes. I think you should probably structure logs like `2020.08.28 ­— Mathematics:` instead, but if you prefer this way then stick with that instead. I agree about the "every number is interesting" proof; by moving on to a new number in that list, you null the last part of the proof! Engineering looks fun so far, btw.
** k0sh3k
*** You keep losing teeth! I'm glad you liked your Tooth Fairy books. :) I really like the way you're writing up your science, and I really like your answer to the question about food chains. You school work in general was done well - good job! I do wish I saw some daily logs in here, so I could see what the rest of your day was like; this is going to be more important to me once I go back to work. I'm going to miss seeing you so much every day!

*** [[1uxb0x]] had a solid week. He's been fairly stable, but his sleep hasn't been great. He had a stomach bug, but it cleared up. It's interesting to see him tunnel into private textfiles instead of his wiki for political drafting (one day, he will emacs instead of vim, and one day we will learn to secure our machines, I [[hope]]). He appears to be growing to appreciate his mother's structure more (and it's good to see his curiosity and self-teaching), and this coming week will be a test of his will (as accountability scaffolding continues to be removed). He's been more likely to think about how to complete his boring chores efficiently because he wants to do his thing; he got some real cleaning done in his room. He keeps physically growing (50th percentile weight and height for his age, but it may be because he's hit puberty slightly earlier), he may be done losing teeth, his hands and feet are as long as mine, and his arms are growing (he needs to take care of his nails and hair). Running has been good (and he showers more, taking after his mother), and it would be good to see some weight training. It's killing me not to actually do schoolwork with him (it's grown to be such an important part of my identity), but it's a good thing for all of us that he's taking the reins.

** 1uxb0x
*** Oof, dang, you lost a lot of work. I agree that having a lot of different subjects each day is good. Thank you for helping me with Rey. Your universe is going along well! I think your week has been okay.
** j3d1h
*** I didn't save most of my work, just a couple subjects, which sucks. I really like having different subjects each day, and that's making it much easier to take notes/get them done. I've gotten really interested in storycrafting patterns(?) this week, and I'd like to learn more about different storytelling mediums. The book I'm reading for creative writing should help out a lot! I'm considering learning to dance (swing, specifically) - I have no physical IQ, which might complicate things, but it'll probably be fun anyway.
** k0sh3k
*** I know you did more work than is shown on your wiki; I hope you figure out how to keep your wiki from losing work. I miss your Prompted Introspections, Antepleonasm Analyses, and Carpe Diems - I like to know what you're doing and thinking. I hope this next week is a good week, even though I'll not be here - you've been very good at being up and downstairs on time. I appreciate how often you've helped your brother this week with various things; you have been gracious even when occasionally frustrated. 
** h0p3
*** [[j3d1h]] had fun with friends. She's thinking about dance, specifically swing (so far, I've been turned down). She's been thinking about her personality some, and maybe going out into the world for dancing. She claims to have done her mother's schoolwork, but there is little evidence. She's enjoying her creative writing class the most, and microeconomics seems to hold her attention. She made tacos this week for the family, and she's been working with her brother on lots of small tasks. Somehow, she has defeated her father in //Dominion//, which don't make no sense.

* [[k0sh3k]]
** 1uxb0x
*** Oh shit! You're going to the worksite again! I hope you don't get covid-19, that'd be bad. I remember having a similar prompt, I didn't understand money well enough. Thank you for giving me a bag. Thank you for helping me develop my beliefs, I wouldn't be me without two pseudo-conflicting parents.
** j3d1h
*** I'm sad you're going to actually go //out// to work now, but I guess it's still good that you will. Hopefully, other people will be relatively sane in the middle of a pandemic. Your RCL is very interesting, even if it's somewhat short - your writing is very clean, and makes the topics easier to understand. Your bathroom upgrade sounds like heaven, and also probably costs more than $100,000. 
** k0sh3k
*** I'm glad I got us all watching Lovecraft Country; it's been a fun show. I feel like I spent a lot of time actually at work, which is weird considering I'll be spending a lot more time there starting tomorrow. I worked very hard to get everyone back to the library physically and yet I'm really going to miss spending time working from home.
** h0p3
*** [[k0sh3k]] has been transitioning to her worksite. It's going to be super weird and sad not having her here during the day. She's been working on her facemasks and getting glasses. She's been thinking about housing. She's been reading a good bit, and //American Gods// + //Lovecraft Country// has been a treat for her. She's not been sleeping well enough (not up to her), and she's been thinking about her [[faith]] and philosophical positions (I admire her openness). She's been, like, way meaner to her husband for the past week (that's because she's mean).

* [[h0p3]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I feel like our school structure has collapsed. I think I may start asking you more questions. I bet your going to say google it a lot more. You spend a lot talking to other people. Thank you for helping me develop my beliefs. I don't think you go to the tooth lord every 15 years, that's unlikely.
** j3d1h
*** It's impressive how many people you keep in touch with - sometimes, I get too tired to respond to anyone at all! (It's also impressive that //they// would //ever// stay in touch with //you//, of course. I guess it all balances out.) Trust me, if I get an SO, I'll tell them you would never listen to such good, logical advice. I'm glad you still took your walk, but I'm wondering why the tape is still up if it's clear enough.
** k0sh3k
*** I have really enjoyed watching American Gods with you, even if you insist on falling behind by falling asleep. You need to work on maintaining my standards, which are frankly minimal, so I won't have to be mean to you, Puppy. You will go to the dentist more than once every 15 years even if it means I have to trick you by promising you walkies and taking you there against your will. Stop dragging your feet on watching American Gods, asshole. You have some friends who are either very crazy or who want to appear very crazy, as though crazy is cool now. I miss the days when people tried to use words to make sense.
** h0p3
*** [[h0p3]] has been even way more loster than usual. Anxiety has fallen, but depression has risen (acceptance of his futility, right?) - he's gonna have to be more rational about it. Reading and writing have been grindy (reading what little he understands of the world has been so costly). However, he's been lucky to connect with many people. He's definitely not alone. [[Sphygmus]]' letter has been one of the best part parts of the week. He's not walked as much as he ought, but he has watched plenty of LoL (no toxicity, just magic). It was a low-responsibility, low-productivity week, and he's privileged to be able to sit on his ass actin' a fool.
