[1:04 PM] [[JRE]]: Purity: The probability that it will not be followed by sensations of the opposite kind.

This concept is incoherent. I'm dismissing this vector.

Surely this is jumping the gun.  While the sensation of expelling gas is unlikely to be followed by a sensation of in taking gas, surely there is a possibility of negative emotional sensations as a consequence.  When the Nazi is at your door asking if yo uh have a jew in your attic, and you fart, you might suffer some negative sensations of being shot in the face.  When you fart during a job interview, you risk unpleasant sensations of sadness. And finally, especially as we get older, we risk having the unpleasant sensation of finding that someone has put shit into our pants after we farted.
[5:08 PM] [[h0p3]]: Going straight into the wiki.
[5:13 PM] [[h0p3]]: Btw, you can edit my wiki directly since you are on our VPN, (I only ask you to tag your name to whatever you edit):

[5:15 PM] [[h0p3]]: I'm making it a footnote of the following format: `<<ref "JRE: 1">>` .... and at the bottom, `<<footnotes "JRE: 1" "Surely this is jumping the gun.

[11:27 PM] [[h0p3]]: Guis. Guis. I think I have a game I want to play.
[11:28 PM] [[JRE]]: PEEEENIS!
[11:28 PM] [[h0p3]]: Lol. Why I can't I quit you, shaihaludito?
[11:29 PM] [[h0p3]]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco_Elysium
[11:32 PM] [[h0p3]]: Seems like a visual novel with character building that goes over the top in what kinds of narratives might fall out of it.
[11:33 PM] [[K]]: Let me know how it is. It looks cool!
[11:33 PM] [[JRE]]: that does not seem like a game you would play... 100% story driven?
[11:34 PM] [[JRE]]: can you be the kind of cop that immediately stops being a cop?
[11:34 PM] [[h0p3]]: Yeah, nothing like what I usually play.
[11:34 PM] [[h0p3]]: I don't know.
[11:34 PM] [[JRE]]: i think that's the only way you would play it lol
[11:35 PM] [[h0p3]]: I will try to play it as myself.
[11:35 PM] [[JRE]]: exactly... if you woke up and found out you were a cop, but in every other relevant sense you were still yourself... you would retire that same day

How's it going?

[3:33 PM] [[JRE]]: In the 3d galaxy view of your wiki, you could pick out individual tiddlers that work together to tell a story about who you were at a time, and call them constellations!
[6:34 PM] [[h0p3]]: Hrm. Lol. That is an interesting idea.
[6:34 PM] [[h0p3]]: I need to think.

We have something like that now, only seen it used once.  Looks like a normal fish tape, but has a motor feed on it
Jun 10 12:13pm
Seems like it would be useful for small things
Jun 10 12:14pm
Although that total bend radius is crazy.  Normally after 360 degrees of total bend, shit won't move
Jun 10 12:14pm
Wonder if it would work of the pipe diameter was bigger
Jun 10 12:14pm
No idea
