title: 2020.11.12 - Wiki Review: Blame Porn 4 Lack of Productivity

* [[2020.11.11 - Link Log: Psychopolitical]]
** I kinda wanna reach out to Caitlin. Keeps showing up for me.

** Well, a week has passed. My tolerance should be in much better shape. Maybe that's what my brain is doing for me automagically. I used to paranoically stop to make sure it was functionally helping me, but now I'm don't force myself. 
*** Could be that I've replaced it. I've felt way less stress in having let go (to whatever [[dok]] I can accept) of my offspring's education duties. That has freed me up to enjoy life like I haven't in a long time.

** I am far more interested in understanding how my changing genetics dictate the immutable and even resistant aspects of my life, the boxes that I live within.

** My brother [[JRE]] has a conservative approach to where he increments in life. I have the privilege of being dependent upon [[k0sh3k]] so far down in both memetics and material that I have the opportunity not to be conservative, in this sense. I throw myself headfirst because I can afford to.
*** He's way more intelligent and knowledgeable than he will admit. As he claims, "standing in my shadow" cannot be easy. I hope he will change his mind and stand up for his own perspective (and I will do my best to shut my facehole [though I know everything bleeds out of me]).
**** He still has time to figure out what kind of relationship he wants with his offspring. I'm not convinced he should be conservative there at all.
