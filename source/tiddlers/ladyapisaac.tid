[20:49:50][ladyapisaac] Thanks much for theHouse MD series.
[20:51:49][h0p3] No problem. Please let me know if you need anything else. I'll do what I can for you.
[20:52:17][h0p3] It's one of my favorite shows. Don't know how many times I've seen it with the family. 
[20:52:24][ladyapisaac] :-)
[20:53:15][ladyapisaac] If only I could get all of our TV on line. Maybe next month.
[20:53:29][h0p3] I don't encounter many who are a fan of C.S. Lewis' Space Trilogy. 
[20:53:55][h0p3] `/nod`. Alright, well, let me know. I'll hunt for it.
[20:54:39][ladyapisaac] Tom is a librarian, archives being his specialty, and I majored in history. We're a diverse pair.
[20:55:59][h0p3] My wife, [[k0sh3k]] (https://philosopher.life/#k0sh3k) is a librarian. She handles access and user services. I majored in philosophy.
[20:56:15][h0p3] I think history and librarianship go together like two peas in a pod. 
[20:56:47][h0p3] (and, I will argue that [[sharing]] your collection on Soulseek makes you a librarian as well, perhaps an underground one*)
[20:58:07][ladyapisaac] LOL. Tom means to go help the new Maritime Museum in Pascagoula MS get up and running next month. I'm looking forward.
[20:59:07][h0p3] I passed through there a few times, back when I lived in New Orleans. 
[20:59:18][h0p3] Will you be heading there with him?
[21:00:17][ladyapisaac] We have been here for almost a year now. Good Grief! it is hot right now!!
[21:00:45][h0p3] `/nod`. Indeed. 
[21:01:12][h0p3] I live up in CT now. It is finally cool (if not cold at night) out. 
[21:04:17][ladyapisaac] We came down from the High Plains Prairie of Pueblo CO. Talk about your clmatechange .... at least we don't need a snow shovelanymore. Fan during the day and heatr at night is a fair winter exchange, say I.
[21:05:39][h0p3] Yeah. Plus, being close to the ocean has its perks. 
[21:06:23][ladyapisaac] Oysters in soon. Yummmmm.
