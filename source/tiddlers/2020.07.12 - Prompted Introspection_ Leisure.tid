!! What is something you do to relax?

[[2019.07.10 - Prompted Introspection: Relax, Ha!]] is correct. I've modified the question because I'd like to push toward trying to answer the question more concretely. I have to tame my manic vices too. Unfortunately, I still can't define relaxation. Relaxed from what, with respect to what? Is it avoiding feelings? Is it simply temporarily putting myself in a less difficult context? For me, "letting go" isn't so easy, and that is often what seems like relaxation to me (but I'm surely missing important pieces here). 

Currently, my [[Morning Routine]] has a section of time for me to meditate, {[[dream]]}, and just lay there blindfolded. Before I make baby Jesus cry, I indulge in this still-watered luxury. Maybe it's a good thing that I have that extra warm-up time after the reboot. I can give reasons for why it's valuable, but I don't have any that shine brightly to me here. It's gotta be one of the most selfish and autistic parts of my day. I find sitting down or laying down, letting myself just get lost in my thought without feeling the need to accomplish anything in particular can be useful (but it isn't always). It's never quiet in my head, but it can be leisure. I [[/b/]]feed on myself.
