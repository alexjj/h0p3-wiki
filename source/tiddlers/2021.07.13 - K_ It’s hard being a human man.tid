"""
Good afternoon! How has summer been treating you?
Yo! =)
It's been a hot one. Been in a groove.
How about you?
Hiya! Haha. Ugh tell me about it. I chose flannel today against my better judgement. Need to catch up on laundry. 

I have just finished summer school and have a brief reprieve before student teaching. So Iâ€™m doing well. I expect tomorrow Iâ€™ll feel like shit because as the anxiety starts to drift away my body will collapse and beg for rest lol. But yeah. Itâ€™s been a spicy fast semester.
How are [[k0sh3k]] and the kiddos?
lmao XD.
Sometimes it is only the anxiety holding us together. Our skeletons.
You know more about how student teaching will go down?
(flannel is cool in the other sense, but I'm from the 80s)
I have my orientation on the 30th, so Iâ€™ll hear more then. What I do know is that Iâ€™ll be working at Butler High school in three Honors Sophomore English classes and two Dual credit senior English classes. So thatâ€™ll be fun. And that starts August 9th.
[[k0sh3k]]'s been switching pain meds, and that's been a difficult transition. Finished off a paper for publishing after her conference. She's finally getting back to what the job is supposed to be after ~18 months.
I think the substitute gig is a done deal too. Waiting for the official word before sounding the alarm though.
`/nod`
How exciting! Whatâ€™s the paper about?
I think it's going to be a blast for you.
Sorry to hear about the pain too. Hoping the new meds work well for her.
Basically every school system has an integrated learning system, and this is her second library where she's used it with student workers (since the job requires training, scheduling, conversations and other coordination). Apparently, it's rare for academic libraries to do this, even though user services librarians work so closely with ILS for course reserves, etc.
Just showin' folks how to use the tools they've already got to get the job done.
Me too on the pain meds. Massages only go so far.
Sounds like something thatâ€™ll do a lot of good for the industry. Thatâ€™s awesome. 

I hear you. Flesh prison is pain haha.
:P. That is exactly how [[k0sh3k]] thinks of it. A long-standing set of spiritual/psych/phil questions made clearer by pain.
Itâ€™s hard being a human man.
All we do is eat, shit, and for some of us, not even be able to sleep.
Hate it here haha
Oh, shit. Yessir. How many hours you gettin on average?
Going without sleep wears on ya.
I can't even think straight or reason about my emotions well enough when I am sleeping well, but without, lawd.
Iâ€™ve managed to claw my way back to 7-8 with a ton of waking up in between. Some nights are  better than others.
how about you?
[[L]] and I are trying to do better with night time winding down.
It helps.
Yes, sir. I know that march. 2021 is the best year of sleep I've had since [[j3d1h]] was born. I'm hoping that once you jump in the water (after the baptism by fire :P), you'll feel more comfortable and in a groove on it.
The offspring are largely outside of my control. Watching [[j3d1h]] fail at parts of life sucks, but it is better now than later. We still have fun each day. I'm less anxious about it overall. She's doing well. Her social life is now what I consider thoroughly integrated into her life, and that's been a pleasure to watch from the sidelines.
[[1uxb0x]]'s been growing into a man who enjoys working with his hands, playing a ton of [[vidya]] [[games]] with rando [[anon]]s. He looks SO much older. I'll have to ask him to consider sending a selfie to folks (been begging him to jump back into physical fitness, as it's time for him to push himself there, get ripped). It's been smoother sailing with him than ever (I assume it will come in waves).
How's [[L]] doing? And your extended fam?
Also, how's the gaming rig been treatin ya?
Whatâ€™s your new sleep routine like? Got any pointers. And yeah I hear you. Itâ€™s never fun to let your babies make their own mistakes but hopefully sheâ€™ll learn from them. I would love to see how [[1uxb0x]] looks these days! 

[[L]] is doing well. Sheâ€™s finding joy in the little things at work and trying out new hobbies and stuff. Family is doing well. New niece and nephew are already growing up way too fast. We got to have a big 4th of July pow wow so that was very nice after Quarantine. 

Computer is great. I need a better graphics card but I will have to continue waiting on that. I can play anything I want on max but I would love 200FPS. ðŸ‘€
My sleep protip: like, just, don't be //so// stressed, dude. Lmao. I'm sorry. I'm the wrong person to ask. Even now, my schedule is all over the fucking place, but I have the radical luxury and privilege of sleeping whenver I want at this point. I have no idea what to do. You're already doing what you're supposed to be doing. It may take time to pass. Keep shopping in bulk, optimizing/automating/organizing, exercise, routine before bed, experimenting with sleep aids.
What new hobbies and stuff she been trying out?
Yall get to do fireworks for 4th of July? Not sure if that's a thing for ya.
Been a while since I've thought much about graphics. My assumption is that if it doesn't dip below your screen's refresh rate, you won't notice a difference. 200FPS sounds sick, especially if you eventually go more in the VR direction (that shit requires real juice).
Iâ€™ll continue trying new things haha. XD Iâ€™m considering experimenting with ASMR-adjacent things for sleep but we shall see. 

[[L]] is trying her hand at world-building, sewing little things out of old clothing and scraps, and taking care of potted plants. I try to bring her flowers whenever I can so she can take care of them haha. 

Yeah we did! Although Iâ€™ve become less interested in fireworks over time. Too loud and polluting, both noise and the ozone haha.

I more want a better card not because I need it, but because I MIGHT need it down the line. Ya know? The two biggest games I play right now are XIV and Dead By Daylight. The former is due for a big graphical upgrade soon and they will likely do so in the next couple years. The latter is slowing upgrading its graphics over time through updates and I donâ€™t want my PC to fall behind because every frame matters when youâ€™re running from the killer!
I require a show I know to fall asleep at this point (one where I can see it in my head, no need for a screen), but now it only takes a few minutes before I pause it and fade out. ASMR doesn't help me sleep, but I could see it helping. Whatever can take your mind off the world. Melatonin doesn't work for me either (just makes me groggy and loose, but my mind races nonetheless).
I saw a tiktok of someone taking clippings and leftover pieces from Home Depot plants and growing rich garden thingies from it.
My only complaint about waiting to upgrade the graphics card is that (at least it used to be case) I have to reinstall Windows for it. If that process is made smooth, it's not so bad (still takes at least a day to set everything back up, sadly).
Thatâ€™s exactly how I would describe melatonin for me too. It doesnâ€™t work. XD

That does sound sucky though. Since I already run Windows I can usually just swap em at least which is helpful.
Theyâ€™re just all out of stock. ðŸ¥º
But Iâ€™m honestly in no rush. Lots of people need cards so I get it.
