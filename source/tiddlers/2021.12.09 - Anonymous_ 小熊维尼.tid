Stranger has disconnected.

This person has no idea how to direct their anger and why. [[gfwiwcgws]]. Come and speak with me anytime, homie. I'll do what I can for ya. I forgot to say a few things (since we were having "fun"). To your color question, perhaps [[2018.12.23 - Prompted Introspection: What Color Is Your...]] is the best answer I've got. I'll agree: may god have mercy on their souls.

Stranger has disconnected.

`/kissblow`. Wake up. So odd to see "No time wasters please" from a person who is clearly wasting our time. Spawned a conversation with my daughter about consent and motivation in his opening line. So far, this is clean, even if it doesn't meet his preferences.
