It do be like that sometimes.
Jan 22 12:36am
Did alot of research on delta 8. I am gonna stop by a head shop and pick some up.
Jan 22 12:37am
That link I sent you has a link to the cheapest you'll be able to find.
Jan 22 12:38am
*probably
Jan 22 12:39am
I'm very glad that you have time to get high. You deserve it.
Jan 22 12:39am
I got some green. But I don't wanna get arrested. And looking for something with less paranoia.
Jan 22 12:41am
Also looked into the butter and oil. And that's a felony in georgia
Jan 22 12:42am
Just because it's edible.
Jan 22 12:43am
I understand.
Jan 22 12:43am
But [[Killcoin]] chilli with sanders is awesome. Sanders skidding is now a all over the internet meme
Jan 22 12:44am
Sitting*
Jan 22 12:45am
May we all grow such luxurious beards.
Jan 22 12:45am
I'd use rogain for mine if it woukd work. Haha
Jan 22 12:47am
Mine has turned grey and white considerably.
Jan 22 12:47am
Balding too.
Jan 22 12:47am
All the hair is growing on my back.
Jan 22 12:47am
Hehe. I got some nifty white strips in my chin hair. Receding. Thankfully no backhair. You just have too much testosterone you sexy beast.
Jan 22 12:50am
I am monke
Jan 22 12:51am
hunched over his machine, typing
Jan 22 12:51am
Starting wars with 4chan
Jan 22 12:51am
I'm the right loser for the job.
Jan 22 12:52am
Come hither, children of 4chan. I must tell ye a story.
Jan 22 12:52am
I live in a glass house. I'm not even looking out my window. Lol
Jan 22 12:52am
I'm tryin to stay dry.
Jan 22 12:53am

Made it to parents house. Phew...
Jan 23 1:58am
Yes, sir. Any difficulties traveling?
Jan 23 1:59am
Nah. Just paranoid. Got my delta 8 catriges. Haven't tried them yet. Fixin to.
Jan 23 2:00am
Noice.
Jan 23 2:00am
A little drunk. Prolly a bad idea. But I wanna try them
Jan 23 2:00am
Well, go slow. Have to do your allergy test anyway. It's very calm in small doses (my wife said she didn't detect it at all), but high doses (at least for me and my brother) cause powerful hallucinations in us.
Jan 23 2:04am
One of the cartridges has a fake weed leaf on it. Kinda ruins the appeal of hiding it.
Jan 23 2:09am
I hear that. I would stick to plain packaged distillate as much as possible. Can pass it off as lipbalm or something.
Jan 23 2:11am
Problem with any cartridge is that they know what it is used for generally.
Jan 23 2:12am
Yeah. I read up on people getting arrested with thc positive tests on cartirdges.
Jan 23 2:13am
Made me pretty paranoid while driving.
Jan 23 2:13am
Yup. Lol.
Jan 23 2:13am
Paranoia really ruins a a buzz.
Jan 23 2:14am
Good music helps
Jan 23 2:14am
Camper is clean for the most part.
Jan 23 2:14am
The house though. I took a video. But I'm embarrassed to show. For fucks sake Man.
Jan 23 2:14am
I'm living in the house while I'm here for now. But man. Picutea/video doesn't show the filth. And this is just a fractional liveable portion of the house.
Jan 23 2:16am
I took 4 hits off cartridge. Even drunk not sure it's enough. Haha. Imma wait. Promise. If I die, I'll shoot myself first.
Jan 23 2:18am
üòÇü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Jan 23 2:18am
Lmao
Jan 23 2:18am
Give it an hour.
Jan 23 2:18am
Better off tested when I'm sober. I won't hit it again. But yeah. Prolly too drunk to notice a difference.
Jan 23 2:20am
I'm eating frozen hot pockets. (microwaved) this will Prolly kill me first. ü§£
Jan 23 2:27am
It's called courage. Hahaha
Jan 23 2:27am
Lol. Ah. I've been lacking that myself lately.
Jan 23 2:27am
Hot pockets are da bes
Jan 23 2:28am
Comfort food, a treat
Jan 23 2:28am
Not date. No idea. Could be yeara old.
Jan 23 2:28am
I should be alright.
Jan 23 2:28am
I. Mean. It's hot pockets.
Jan 23 2:28am
When did you eat your first hot pocket?
Jan 23 2:28am
Like in my life or here?
Jan 23 2:29am
in your life
Jan 23 2:29am
Before 16. Between 12 and 15 Prolly.
Jan 23 2:29am
They are exoensive.
Jan 23 2:29am
U?
Jan 23 2:30am
Yeah, same.
Jan 23 2:31am
Not until after we moved away from Mannsville.
Jan 23 2:31am
I sware. It's like showing up at a fish camp that hasn't been used in a year or more.
Jan 23 2:33am
Sadly. This is how my stepfather has been living.
Jan 23 2:33am
Sheet.... I gotta go unload my truck now.
Jan 23 2:34am
Running 400ft of cat 5e cable tomorrow to try to get internet in the camper.
Jan 23 2:34am
I've ran 200 to my garage and it was quality. And that was cat 5. This is cat 5e and should be fine. Just slower. But for their purposes it should be fine.
Jan 23 2:35am
Lol. Damn. 400ft. That is a ton.
Jan 23 2:37am
Hope it works. For real. Even at degraded conditions. It will. Operate. Netflix, Facebook, and YouTube.
Jan 23 2:45am
Ah, I would bet it will be hardly degraded at all. Should be amazing.
Jan 23 2:46am
Could not imagine not having the interwebs.
Jan 23 2:47am
This house it bad. I need more drugs. Lol
Jan 23 2:55am
It's got internet.
Jan 23 2:55am
That was 20 years ago...

Not. Searching for. Sympathy. Many have survived worse. I'm just a son in shock. Trying to figure out hot to. Make this liveable for my mother.
Jan 23 3:05am
I hear that. Naw, even though you aren't searching for it, I do sympathize. It must be an exceptionally emotional time. This is your mom's life. I can imagine it's a lot to take in.
Jan 23 3:07am
Sadly we are just waiting on a prognosis and to see how she responds to treatment. She is currently living in the fifth wheel camper. Which is very nice. However the county has an ordinance on not using campers as permanent residence despite the fact its poverty stricken county with hundreds of slum houses in the black community.
Jan 23 3:09am
That sucks. =/
Jan 23 3:10am
I say again. Not enough drugs. No wonder I stayed incoherent 90% of highschool.
Jan 23 3:11am
Even Dana dorms without A/C weren't as bad as Georgia heat without a/c. Hahah
Jan 23 3:11am
It is hard to explain without seeing it. Majority of the first floor is still dirt floor and unliveable. Still. Has hand hwen beams into original limestone pillars.
Jan 23 3:13am
A few of the houses we looked at had some dirt floors. Old farm houses and cottages.
Jan 23 3:15am
Sounds like a lot of hard work went into that house.
Jan 23 3:15am
It was built in mid 1700s

Jan 23 3:15am
