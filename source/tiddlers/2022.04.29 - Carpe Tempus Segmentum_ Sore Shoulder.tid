title: 2022.04.29 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Sore Shoulder

Woke at 8? Not enough, but it will do. Rumination. Meditation. [[TTTOTW]].

Hugs'n'bugs with my offspring. They seem to be on point today and relatively happy. =). [[5c0ut]]'s may have another position, which is cool. [[TTTOTW]]. Did speak with robot-writer [[anon]] a bit (asked a question that I should answer).

[[D2]] and [[MTG]] didn't work out. My sympaticon was not having a good morning. 

//The Walk// with my sympaticon. Dialectics. Vapelyfe. The walk was much needed. We ended up bringing a dead tree home, two walking sticks, and a wand with vines spiraled around it. Our neighbor is there to help when it benefits him. 

[[D2]] a couple runs. No key yet. Twerk pulled a Pul. 

Grabbed food with folks. I had tortillas with roja sauce. It's a vehicle. //Boiler Room// with my offspring and sympaticon. Lots of [[pause]]s and analysis, a significant step up from yesterday's narrative. Rabbitholed. Vapelyfe. Worthy drama. Sadly, I cannot say the film stands up to scrutiny, but I'm glad we watched it. We also had a couple cookies. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Assignments. Hoping they will make quick work of the door. We'll see.

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. Muscles are feeling better, but her sleep is back to not great. Gonna try another route. She's gonna take a day off early next week to make up for overtime. She's gonna miss her professor; he's moving to the other side of the country tomorrow. A gift and card for him that hit the spot. //Inform the Men!// 

Erryone but [[k0sh3k]] (who was showering) sat in The Commons, chatting and vaping. It was pleasant and wandering, plenty of [[wrestling]] too. My daughter is thinking about the tattoo apprenticeship. Dope. We all volunteered to be her first guinea pig. Wish I could even remember all that we talked about, but brain don't work right. Several times we have attempted to summon the aliens with our unison hum, and, to be clear: it's all one song (even the long periods of silence that sometimes lasts for weeks between each note). [[The Alien Asylum]] is not a place for sane people. 

[[D2]]. Aurora is 91, Neckromancer 92! Twerk found an Um. We tested Lower Resist instead of Decrepify, but the lack of control wasn't worth even slim damage advantage it offers under ideal conditions. The Fortitude runeword built for the Assassin has been moved to the necromancer's merc (and Hel'd the eth Hone sundan to go triple shael, as a lack of Treachery requires it). He is noticeably stronger, though it is an expensive choice. Need more resists and FHR to make sure I can Flight onto Nihlathak faster on average. My sympaticon has been making it easier on us to accelerate minion creation into taking the throne room quickly. Doesn't take too much to bootstrap off the initial waves either; we are improving. We may eventually hit 4 minute runs, especially after Enigma and Infinity.

Put mi amor to bed. My son was working on the door hardware, unhappy with it. We'll give it another go. He's figuring out which tools he wants to use (and I'm not voicing my opinion yet). [[TTTOTW]].
