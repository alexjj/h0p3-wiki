title: 2020.06.09 - Wiki Review: ギッシュギャッシュ

* [[2020.06.08 - Link Log: Cleaning]]
** Wat. You fool! <3. I am surprised to see you getting down to bidness. `/high-5`
* [[2020.06.08 - PAlec: New Rationalism]]
** I need to respond! 
** I'm trying to be delicate. I do respect aspects of the Lesswrong crew, but I'm not going to be nice about their metaethics. We do have a lot in common though, and I hope to build on that.
* [[PT: Franz Brentano]]
** I need to fix the naming.
* [[PT: Nietzsche]]
** I think we should do this in multiple passes. I want this work done before we start seeking living philosophers. 
*** I'd be interested to see them argue against the summations as well. That'd be fine with me. I'd like to capture that mushroom cloud.
* [[PT: William James]]
** I don't like that we aren't making progress in SEP directly, but this is such an important piece of the puzzle.
* [[PT: Charles Sanders Peirce]]
** This project seems small in a way, but it could be huge. I like the idea that we might interview. Odds are good it will just fail. 
*** Who gives a fuck if it fails? You fail at some things, loser =). It's a good idea, and while they probably don't have time for a rando (because it doesn't help their career), you still get to find the [[diamond]]s in the rough, to give them a chance to exercise their autonomy.  
* [[PT: Karl Marx]]
** Follow-up messages should turn up the trollheat. =) That's when it's time to get funny. Most of them are reactionary assholes, ofc.
* [[2020.06.08 - Wiki Review: Asserting My Dumbinance]]
** When she has time*...
** Was nice to speak with her about it on our walk. Saint Elijah, ofc, is the most badass and prophetiest of prophets. 
*** Though we had to argue through the other contenders just to see.
* [[2020.06.08 - TDL: 白左]]
** Easy to hit when you write it so late. =)
* [[2020.06.08 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Ummm]]
** I should have stopped at one. =/. Alcoholic. 
* [[2020.06.08 - Prompted Introspection: Pearson the Philosopher]]
** I kinda wish I answered this more often. I don't think I will have enough chances to answer this thoroughly.
* [[2020.06.08 - h0p3ful Review: Flinging Poo]]
** One of my favorite parts of our [[h0p3ful Review]] time is the ability to criticize together and to hand off autonomy. 
* [[2020.06.08 - h0p3ful Review: Practice Sounding Hoomin]]
** Trying to reason about our approval seeking wisely is another crucial aspect, [[WINTCIS]].
