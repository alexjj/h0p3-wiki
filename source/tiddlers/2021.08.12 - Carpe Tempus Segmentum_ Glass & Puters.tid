title: 2021.08.12 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Glass & Puters

Woke at 12:15. Not enough, but it'll do. Pressure all around my head. Someone left a glass (as well as chairs/plastic containers we use a stools) out, knocked over my concrete floor in the dark. ~~My foot is good~~ goddamnit, there's glass in my foot that I can't get out. 

A flash. =)

[[TTTOTW]]. Took a shit. Water + Footbath + [[TTTOTW]].

[[Emy|2021.08.12 - Anonymous: For Emy]] brightened my day, gave me some [[hope]]. `/high-5`.

Still can't get this glass out of my heel.<<ref "m">> =/. My surgeon could not remove it either (she was in alright spirits this morning). It's tiny but potent.<<ref "i">> I will pout and bitch and moan. y me, lord? I had pizza. It was good. [[TTTOTW]] until I could not stay awake. Sleep by 8:30?

Woke at 12? Solid sleep, but vivid nightmares. Radical violence; this is extremely rare. Woke up not feeling good. Meditation. [[TTTOTW]]. Took a shit, [[Morning Routine]]. Hugs'n'bugs, Dinner prep. [[TTTOTW]].

Fireman Time! Footbath. Shard remains. It hurts to step on it. I'm going to keep complaining. =D.

Called [[JRE]] back (he rang twice, but I was busy :P). [[Q]] is worrying him, a rash that some kids had to go to the hospital for at his daycare, if I understood correctly. They will be required to put a mask on [[Bn]] for daycare because he's 2, but there's not enough communication traction to even really do so (let alone the fact that he's 2, so it would have to enforced without parental involvement at some non-trivial level; I don't think they will be doing that for 2yo's...3-4 is probably closer to the average is my bet too). He's traveling (on company time) to Oldham County (who gave their contract over to his company), and it's been nice for him (lots of Vaush time, I take it). [[Rb]] is feeling less anxious, like the dust has settled. He's been having significant nightmares and anxiety about his offspring being in danger (the worst feeling), opening a new world for him (and, I should have said that he should consider getting her a prescription or blackmarket the anxiety meds). He's only getting 5 hours of sleep tops a night, =/ (says he could work it out to get 7.5). He's been feeling off about the world too (also, told me a story about a purposeful hate-fueled demo-derby in front of his house). Science, philosophy, social media, and politics: we rabbitholed. Also, he discussed an aspect of the ultimate [[ROG]] that includes [[Cypher's Choice]], of not even suffering the consequences of remembering our choices when we wouldn't want to. He also inverted the Chinese Room as his initial intuition; as a joke, claimed to feel like sometimes all he does is pass symbols around according to various standards without understanding (we just move things around). He's got this curious gift to just play with the thought experiment; imagination has always been one of his key intelligences. He feels like we are spinning our wheels on the same conversation, and that's okay; I'm honored that he would have the conversation with me long-term (he's being too hard on himself, especially since he's so god damn busy as a dad).  

Chitchat with [[66912]].

Offspring came down to work. My daughter has moved onto the next set of [[Business Cards]], and we'll probably keep them roughly the same. There's some changes though.<<ref "r">> Badnews: my son's 2-in-1 just died right in front of us. We'll still try a few hail mary's, but I'm not holding my breath. ~~Gonna give him mine. `/salute`, [[monster]]-18, you served me well.~~ I need to push some data over (don't forget, idiot!). We tried chocolate covered coffee beans (they don't adore them, yet). [[TTTOTW]].

//Skintime//. Consume. Downstairs, she read + Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

[[Family Gathering]]. Kielbasa, onions, green beans, water. It was solid. We had some Jolly Ranchers too. We watched //The Dark Crystal//, and we were talkative during it. I thought the skeksis had wings, but I was wrong. Realized I do have more in common with that hag than I thought I did. [[Neat]].

We have to have a laptop for plenty of family occasions (especially [[Family Time]]). We have to get another. We're gettin' one for [[k0sh3k]], who already finds herself resource limited on the machine she has (and she doesn't make use of the touch screen at all). tree fiddy fo T470 i5-6300U, 16GB RAM, 256GB NVMe with charger. My son now has a [[project]]. Also, continue finding myself in need of wireless keyboard for [[m16]]. Need to type during [[Family Gathering]] so often.

My wife was able to extract the glass with needles! Woot! I can walk again. It's a miracle. Praise all that is holy and so forth and so on! One more footbath (this shit is addictive...put muh feetz in hot water...it do be hittin'...decranks me [and I'll about gettin' worked up on my crank]). Cleanup. 

Son talked with me about taking my wife's very snazzy desktop that has gone used. He can take his craptop and plug it in, and boomshakala, huge upgrades for him. He stays in Linux 95% of the time anyway, might as well make that his best machine. Doesn't need a dGPU. Wireless nearly NUC SFF; couldn't build that thing for a thousand. He's got an exciting week ahead. We should plan.

[[TTTOTW]].
