title: 2021.12.07 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Social Dreams

Finished the double route walk with [[ASK]]. Leftovers and tea + //China, IL//. Massage. //Skintime// + //One Piece//. Fell asleep at 3. 

Woke at 11. Again, social dreams. Rumination. Meditation. Fireman Time! Hugs'n'bugs for everyone. [[TTTOTW]]. [[ASK]] is experiencing data loss from a race condition with her phone failing to sync from the desktop. Went over the savetrail, and she wants her laptop working so she won't be reliant upon the phone. `/thumbs-up`.

The offspring came down to grind. My son walked through the process on webster with [[ASK]]. We wandered around in our conversations as they worked on webster. Planned our meals too. It was chill and met minimal productivity requirements for everyone ([[ASK]] drowning in information overload, understandably). She's got a basic [[RGM]] up and running. She's a natural on the command line because she knows the limits of what she doesn't know and enjoys reading documentation. Balls deep in Arch Linux wiki, `/nod`. Good. I would not be surprised if she quickly surpasses me in this practice. I tried making some of that Asian clove tea: it's not delicious (or I have no idea what I'm doing, probably that). Dark chocolate for me, kitty crack and scritches for Meow (my daughter teaching her to ruin my waterproof bedsheet...that troll).

[[Morning Routine]]. Cleaning. Sink and washer gettin' some treatment. Footbath to clean and warm up my cold, nasty feetuses. [[TTTOTW]]. [[ASK]] acquired two pairs of fuzzy fingerless gloves with USB heatpads in them for when we're typing on our [[monster]]s. My furry transformation begins. I've already got the actual body fur down (also, recently, the hair on my knuckles has been longer than usual). Apparently, I may become a furry as soon as I begin wearing the buttplug tail. INC! Also, I do feel the warmth of [[m16]], more literally touching it the entire time. I'm bound to it. Cybernetic Furry Tooling.

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. Much better day. SL instantly changed her mind about the office change, workin' out nicely. I still haven't received pics or measurements. I want to dress it up like [[AA]] for [[UJ]]. //Inform the Men!// Meditation. Shower of the gods!

She came down to play [[music]] for me. [[TTTOTW]].

[[Family Gathering]] was quite pleasant. Pizza, tater tots, salad, and water. Watched the Gypsy episode of //House//. Nearly //Skintime//, but someone sat in a puddle of cum and was quite unhappy. `/sigh`.

//Skintime// with [[ASK]]. 

Organized [[vidyas]] on [[m16]]. Prepping, of course. [[TTTOTW]].
