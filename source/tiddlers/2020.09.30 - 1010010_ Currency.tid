"""
[05:04:08] 1010010: greetings
[11:13:56] h0p3: yo =)
[11:13:59] h0p3: How goes it?
[11:14:13] 1010010: largely good
[11:14:15] 1010010: yourself?
[11:17:01] h0p3: Moving in a few months, I think. Figuring that out. Going to catchup on League of Legends (LoL) tournaments for worlds. Lots of walking and talking with people. And, I really should catchup on my wiki work.
[11:17:13] h0p3: I'm doing well.
[11:17:54] 1010010: glad to hear that
[11:18:04] 1010010: do you have any involvement in cryptocurrency at all?
[11:18:24] h0p3: Some, yes.
[11:18:52] h0p3: I mined some of the original bitcoin back when I lived in [[Thailand]], but I thought it was just a toy (and it was at the time). 
[11:18:59] 1010010: kek
[11:19:08] 1010010: how about monero, doge?
[11:20:16] h0p3: Recently spoke about Monero (https://philosopher.life/#Le%20Reddit%20Log%3A%20Jibberjabber)
[11:20:39] h0p3: I adore what memecoins teach us about the nature of money too.
[11:21:01] 1010010: yep
[11:21:05] h0p3: How about yourself?
[11:21:22] 1010010: yes, I am big on cryptocurrency
[11:21:32] 1010010: they're my preferred mode of transferring value
[11:21:55] 1010010: especially when I have issues with banks being woefully inefficient as they are today
[12:32:53] h0p3: How do you feel about The Almighty Dollar?
[12:48:32] 1010010: I'm no fan of fiat currency
[12:48:47] 1010010: or Uncle Sam
[13:03:28] 1010010: yourself?
[13:16:30] h0p3: I don't have a complete answer, sadly. There's a lot of directions to go here. I'm no fan of capitalists (and hence not of the US government either). Fiat is backed by coercion. I favor enforcing The Golden Rule, particularly since I think most humans above the age of 25 are egoists who don't actually give a shit about the global poor. 
[13:17:41] h0p3: I am open to the possibility of hyperinflation, japanification, and capitalists aiming for another kind of reserve currency beyond the USD.
[13:19:21] h0p3: I'm unimpressed by the design of most cryptocurrencies, especially as it seems as though they promote the centralization of holdings (and hence of power) despite having some decentralizing features that would disrupt other currencies or bypass some methods of control.
[13:19:52] 1010010: yes, most cryptocurrencies are trash
[13:19:58] 1010010: but it's an evolutionary process
[13:20:03] 1010010: we're in stage 1 right now
[13:20:08] h0p3: I appreciate that.
[13:21:25] h0p3: I'm a fan of quadratic ranged voting.
