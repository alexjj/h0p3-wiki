It's great to [[hear back|Contact]] from you. Let me know if I can be of any [[help]], [[nomad|FTO]].

Hi there :-)

Thanks, a very kind response to my mean comment. Very funny! 
<<<

I [[hope]] it is one of my classic [[soft dance moves|2020.04.27 - azl: Out Of The Red]] at this point.<<ref "p">> I'm sure you won't miss a beat. [[I'd much prefer to dance rather than brawl|2019.06.25 - DeathOfRobinhood: The Chickenscratch Confession Booktour]], despite being more instinctively suited to the latter.<<ref "r">> I can, of course, feel insecure about my [[‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±]] and my life. Hopefully, you will cleverly be able to set aside my hot-headed autistically pointy sch//reeeeee//ching.<<ref "s">> I'm glad you are able to laugh with me about it. Lol. While I will inevitably fail to express it well enough, I'm lucky to have [[friends who teach me|2020.04.28 - kickscondor: Learning Me Your Blargles]] how to laugh, especially at myself.

<<<
I think I got as far as mousing over 'antipleonasmic' and 'Diamonized' on your principles page. But reading further just now, it's not so..repellent/bad/crazy as it seemed. Hehe. Plus the site navigation is bewildering the first time.
<<<

Lol. =)

Yeah, I wish I knew how to make it less disorienting. There's a bunch of stuff in here, and it's not so easy to piece it together, let alone build abstractions and funneled windows into it. Too often, it's chaos at the static bottom, but I [[hope]] to find simplicity out of the clutter [[irwartfrr]]. Even those I know who use TW quite a bit each seem to have different approaches and intuitions on the matter. I don't know how to generalize it well enough. That problem too is a deep philosophical concern. 

<<<
I was hugely into philosophy in my 20s and 30s (now 48!) .. 
<<<

Me too! I've not quite grown out of my interest in philosophy or seeking. I do not claim to be able to resolve them well enough, of course, but doing philosophy is a part of who I am (even before I knew what the word might mean).

It must be interesting for you being able to look back over the decades. I have no idea what I will think when I grow up to be your age. As odd as it sounds, I am less optimistic about how long I have to live on this rock, and it is one of my goals to live to be [[48|The Plan.plan]].<<ref "48">> My primary responsibilities as a parent to [[my youngest|1uxb0x]] will have been met. His frontal lobes will have finished their major development. I'm looking forward to doing DMT, LSD, or shrooms with him; pop that openness wide open, give him a chance to undo the mountain of damage I have caused as a [[father|BAGD]]. I hope he will begin to crystallize at 48 into the person he justifiably wants to be.

<<<
In my 20s I couldn't understand why Hume would give up philosophy for history, now it makes perfect sense.
<<<

I'm afraid I still can't understand such flowery skeptics to their liking. He is All Too Humean for my apparently vicious sensibilities. [[Arrogant]]ly, I charge him with never doing philosophy well enough given what he had; he gave up before he even started. Perhaps that's not fair though because the man was so ~~conveniently~~ brilliantly misguided. XD. I suggest he gave up on philosophy (though I consider history part of philosophy, in the broad scheme of things) because it was instrumentally rational given his vile position. I suppose if he wasn't going to repent and engage in seeking wisdom, he should wag his finger and quiet himself. We are all, of course, very lucky to contemplate his words. My primary debt to Hume is in virtue of his awakening Saint Kant from his dogmatic slumber (though, that may have gone South too).<<ref "a">> 

<<<
"Wisdom consists of asking questions instead of taking things for granted. True wisdom consists of taking things for granted instead of asking so many questions. Shut up and deal the cards!" (Was also a religious seeker and realized the "seeker" defines themselves as someone who hasn't found what they're looking for.)
<<<

I appreciate how picking out the [[salient]] questions from the infinite number of them is the problem.<<ref "z">> That, of course, does not give us the right to stop [[questioning everything|Question Everything]], even if we rely upon {[[Axioms]]}. I do appreciate being pragmatic and even prudential to some [[dok]], though in service to what? I am not convinced anyone escapes being a seeker (I consider desire to be a necessary condition of consciousness itself, and probably suffering too), though some are tacitly so and others are more explicitly aware of it in various contexts (and to various [[dok]]). 

It is, of course, a dangerous question to ask any nomad: what do you seek?

<<<
Have you read Dennis Rohatyn's Philosophy, History, Sophistry?! (That was a quote from it) Your writing keeps reminding me of him. It's totally packed with sick jokes and puns, sometimes a few per line. I'm sure you'd love it. (It's very serious also.) Hard to find, well worth ordering online. It has an amazing bibliography too. I love it so much.
<<<

That is high praise. Thank you. Coming from you, given your painstaking and profound quote curation virtue, that is absurdly high praise. I could only hope to live up to something like that.

That book isn't easy to find. Luckily, [[a librarian I know|k0sh3k]] has a copy at her library, so when she can get back into the building during this CV19 pandemic (and cut through the red tape), I should be able to take a closer look. I can appreciate the problem the book is facing. You have a lot of interesting books on your curated shelf. I also appreciate the sheer variety and breadth of your interests. Your meme collection is gorgeous, and it does say something about you. You enable those who are illiterate like me to glimpse into magical doorways.

<<<
Also Chesterton is very good on life, philosophy, welcoming the absurd.. Try Heretics then Orthodoxy until it gets too Christian halfway through. 
<<<

Thank you for the recommendations! I appreciate the style of philosophy you pick out. 

Chesterton is a special animal. I don't deny it. Back when I was Christian, I thought even more highly of him too. He's witty, vivid, and aphoristic, but he does not stand up to systematic scrutiny and [[Straussian]] steelmanning as much as I'd [[hope]]. Still, he continues to drop bombs over the years for me. I should look again. Thank you for the recommendations.

<<<
I'm into people who can write well, entertainingly, as well as profoundly! The philosophers studied at university are mostly those who write badly and so have interpreters, not readers. Blah blah. 
<<<

I can see that about you! Your quotes alone make it loud and clear. 

I despise reading the German idealists in particular for this reason. They are pure hell to read, borderline obscurantist and impossible to parse (I am not happy that I mimic this lack of succinct clarity, inspiring [[antipleonasm]]s, and raconteurship). It's my experience that some systematic philosophers require lifelong interpreters to make the texts come alive. I feel exceptionally indebted to both the author and the interpreter as secondary author for these beasts. Unfortunately, there are some kinds of knowledge that can't be communicated directly or shortly enough.

It is my hope that these secondary authors will refine and retell the stories more wisely than the original authors. It reminds me of people who try to translate poetry between languages. It seems like an almost impossible task.<<ref "q">>


I look for philosophers in lots of places, including the informal, the disgusting, the crazy, and so on. I think there's plenty to be said for your criticism. I like how you pick out what is [[salient]] in [[The Great Human Conversation]]. You already know that how you select the quotes is part of your originality or authenticity (whatever these words mean). You have an incredibly high [[S2NR]] is your curation. Your work is stunning! You are a special fucking [[monster]] in this practice, and I mean that strictly as a compliment. We are all lucky to see your [[quote|https://www.kickscondor.com/admiring-quotebacks-strategy]] collection so [[publically|PSM]]. It's quite the antipleonasmic window into your soul which I'm straight up looting, wholesale. It's incredible.

<<<
So what/who are you into? I guess you will point me to a page of your site. Like your HN comments mostly do. I guess unavoidable as your site becomes more and more like your brain.
<<<

I work to make it more and more like my slowly changing brain. It may only ever be an //impression//. [[Saint Plato]] seems to be one I cannot escape. I hold many philosophers in high regard though, and I try to appreciate even my enemies. I'm happy to think about any particular philosopher you have in mind too.

<<<
My 2 collections of quotes are the best representation of my brain that I have, it seems almost too revealing to have them online! They show everything I was thinking about.
<<<

I can appreciate why it is important to be so careful with what information we generate and transmit. It's not an easy problem.
I don't think it's even remotely too revealing, but I'm glad you do it. Even a 2% rate of [[gems]] for me is insane, so your quote collection is one of the best I've ever encountered in my life. Thank you for making it public. 

I can see that you are a quoteswhore (I'm working at it; I'm just not as skilled or as well-read as you are). Do you know any other quotewhores as skilled as you are here? I'd love to walk through their treasure chests too. I'm especially fond of when lists of quotes tell stories. 

<<<
When I come across a quote from the first collection in a book, it usually seems the worst sentence on the page. Which is progress, I guess.

Cheers, Adam
<<<

You are obviously extremely well-read and well-thought. You are a philosopher who has studied what it means to be mortal. It is a great art in [[The Great Human Conversation]]. Thank you for allowing me to think about what you see.

Not everyone responds to me as kindly and openly as you have. I appreciate your candor. Unfortunately, you will have to interpret me if you are to communicate with me at all. I can never guarantee it will be fun or entertaining. I am, of course, a crazy person. I know it. Sometimes my wiki is like a satellite dish for me (feels like a lotta triangles). Like Sir Isaac Newton, you'll have to throw paint at the wall to see what sticks. I hope to pick out what is [[salient]] with you.

I realize that I'm finishing this letter so very, very late. I [[hope]] you won't mind how slow I've been. I've had a lot on my mind, and your letter has required some digestion.

Sincerely,

[[h0p3]]
