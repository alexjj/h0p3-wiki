title: 2021.08.24 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: When Will It Slow Down?

Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. DD on [[chameleon]]'s [[Letter]]. 

She's up. She got enough sleep, but feels tired still. Progress. Bugged her, as one does. I'm 4yo, ofc. I had the other half of the watermelon. I forget what we talked about, =/: I was super sleepy. I got enough XOXOs to tie me over.

Sleep by 8:30ish? Woke at 3:30ish? Absurd dreams, primarily in some agglomeration of schools. I'm always zooming around in these types of dreams, but it was more social than usual. Meditation.

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

//The Walk// with my offspring was, with just a few exceptions, aretaically arete, my ninja. She did her work, and he didn't (I'm surprised). We talked about The Youtubes he watched instead, and she gave us her explanation of "Chad" Henry VIII in zoomermemespeak (this is how she explains it to her friends) until I demanded a more formal exploration of a few problems (for the first time, this year has been one in which my son is having to be asked to be quiet to let the other student answer; it's a delight for this father to see).

[[Reggie]] motioned to us shirtless (that's how you know we're family now...I walk around in only my underwear most of the time - on top of the smell, enjoy my hairy asscrack, moobies, and chins fam), and he said to continue our walk, but on the way back to stop by. When we arrived, he had prepped the area for our encounter. He had a generous discussion with us. It has become more of he and me on the stage with the offspring standing back as the audience. I threw can-openers, a couple bricks, and stuck quarters into the man to give him the extra boost in telling us his story as best he knows it. The man spoke of many perils of capitalism, egoism, and libertarianism (got plenty wrong too, and I was less gentle this time [you will have to defend that claim with me, sir]), though he is only able to read (he cannot write; though he has cheatsheets he uses to balance his checkbook and maintain records of inventory). He asked me about who lives in our house, and with only having heard that my brother lived with us he was worried that my brother is a bum; I explained how absurdly difficult it is for people who don't own a house to survive on low-end wages (and, then he remembered his son, and he decided I was right as we walked through the finances and that man's past). This is a man who grew up with nothing, and I lay down palm branches as he walks us through his life and his work. I asked him some harder questions to juice him for wisdom (and, there were many displays of practical wisdom for us to wrestle with; the man knew why I asked with the audience in front of us [and, of course, so did they]). We listened closely. He's worried about his memory (he did repeat [[new]]s to us from previous encounters more than usual), and he told us about his mother's alzheimer's (he agrees that staying busy, physically active especially, and contacting old friends and getting back together with the band [every night this week, he says], is crucial to his mental health). He told us he tries to be honest (unlike most of the world according to him), except for a few honest lies (and, then, he lit up for a moment as he told me about his wife who would call him out on every single lie he told). His son is likely breaking up with his GF, money problems and difference in social status between them (never really were in love, perhaps). He had picked many tomatoes and other veggies, and he directed us to take what we wanted (even I was required to make sure I chose some [green tomatoes for her]). I asked him questions about his life as a craftsman, and perhaps he will tell us the stories of his tools. The conversation ended then abruptly restarted 4 times as we were leaving, another 5 minutes here and there. The person speaks, and we listen. He regularly tells me throughout the conversation (in many ways) that staying busy, having a plan to work on the house, is what's keeping  him alive and out of bed (his mother may be waiting to die, and it another person is losing [already lost in many ways]). He talked about his meditation practices, reflecting on his life, how very expensive it is to him. He's planning on giving away all his stuff and selling house (that's why he's pushing harder than usual), and he's also convinced he needs to take a trip to Canada soon to see his mom, even if it may cost him extra (despite the warnings he gave us).

My daughter was sweating hard and blacking out near the end (even listening is a draining affair); we didn't know until she told us (she really didn't want to interrupt, =/). Candy and water immediately. As we left the stage, she caught her breath. She hasn't taken her iron in at least two days. Talked about what it means to advocate for our own health with our doctors (begged her). Lots to think about in our discussion with [[Reggie]]. Also, my daughter said that adults don't listen to children or care what they think. I said, "I do." She says, "You're not an adult, obviously...You saw the world for what it was and regressed." XD. I'm on track. Bunch of other sick burns, but I don't remember it all. Too much in a couple hours to remember.

//Foundation and Empire// 03:33:33. =).

//Raw Skintime//. She's exhausted. The world is not slowing down for her. It's one of our jokes at this point: "is it ever going to slow down?" XD. Lol. It's been a helluva day. I was offered a gift, but I think she'd prefer a shower now. Save it up. I'll take it later. 

...Oh, bad news, no hot water. Reset the igniter, and it failed after 30 seconds. We can't reset it again. Needs a professional. Better than having a failure during the winter. She's just pissed now (understandably). Anything that is not a boiling hot shower is painful to her.

Finished making dinner with my offspring. They are getting faster, and my son did a much better job of searing the beef without cooking it through. She's having trouble with her machine, so it's adding insult to the day's injuries. Did what I could to make her comfortable.

[[Family Gathering]] was great. I think it alleviated some of my wife's suffering. She has a much better knowledge of history, so she could converse far more about the protestant reformation and the politics of the era with my daughter (the boys just listened). We had asha noodles, a veggie bar to add texture, bits of steak, mushroom, and I had water (also some dark chocolate). Shit was dope. We watched the second episode of //House//, and I groaned and warned them again about what I don't like about the rocky start of this show.

Got my last XOXOs. [[TTTOTW]].
