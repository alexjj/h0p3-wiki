title: 2022.05.07 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Date

Woke at 3. Fireman Time! Sleep again. Woke at 8:30? Meditation. //Skintime// with my sympaticon. 

Breakfast with mi amor. She made coffee, egg on toast, and I also had a bit of a danish. XOXOs with folks. [[5c0ut]] seems unhappy today. Assignments. 

//The Date// with mi amor. Errands and chill.

Shopping @ W-Entity. Picked up meds.

Shopping @ Burlington with mi amor. I scoured with her. Found the bottle brush we need. I adore being in the changing room with her. =D. I successfully picked out half the winners. May she have something she feels comfortable wearing at work this summer. 

We got chicken sammiches, and I had a soda water. 

Mi amor hit the coffee shop, and we're going to see if whole bean will work (the grinder I've used to create DMT has too much tree bark in it, and it's banged up). I could imagine prices will only continue to go up, and beyond other inflation measures. While she did that, I stopped by PCity. Met with the dude at the encounter (he actually knew what I was talking about this time, and that was refreshing), and we engaged in stonertalk about wax liquidizers. He and his boss talked with about their Δ⁸ product lines with me, which are wildly more expensive than they should be. We exchanged cards, and I was asked for prices. `/wave`.

Talked with offspring about the idea.

Helping mi amor study for her Greek final in [[The Den]]. She's a fast translator though she feels less comfortable in pure syntax analysis (her reading skill goes far), and I'm feeling more confident about later classwork (which is mostly translation except in [[wrestling]] over exceptions). My sympaticon is furiously writing with the standing barrier curled around her desk, vaping, working in secrecy. Go her. [[TTTOTW]]. 

//Inform the Men!// Shower of the gods!

[[D2]] is magically fixed (I touched nothing, and I thank whatever gods decided to do this for me, and so forth, and so on). Baal runs went very poorly. My sympaticon did not get nearly enough sleep. We had fun though.

[[5c0ut]] popped down and back up. Went to see how he's doing. Feeling not great. Depressive swing. Hates his job. Dev went to NY with friends, and hasn't been in contact with him (I have my opinions, ofc, and they can be provided when I'm asked). He came down to chill with us some, but doesn't care for it (doesn't like how quiet the house is). 

[[D2]]. Gave up for the evening. Way too many deaths on Aurora, and we were struggling with trash. Soloing most waves with little control. I don't like the lack of pure Bone sometimes, but it's a worthy trade overall.

XOXOs for everyone. Put my sympaticon to bed. Put mi amor to bed (twice actually). 

[[TTTOTW]].
