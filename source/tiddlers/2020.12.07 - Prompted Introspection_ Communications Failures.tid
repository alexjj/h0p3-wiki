title: 2020.12.07 - Prompted Introspection: Communications Failures

!! In what ways do you tend to fail at communication?

Oh, Jesus. Let me count the ways, infinity to infinity. Samwise, why are you doing this to me? I'm speaking to you, a conjured, emulated, invisible puppet mirror-sounding-board because I often find it easier to speak with you than flesh and blood.<<ref "p">> That's sad (though I find some joy in it!). I don't think that really makes me crazy (even though, I am crazy, no doubt); no, I'd argue it's exceptionally rational, but the practice and belief formation of roleplaying with you, breathing half a life into you, and talking to you in a public setting: that's something normally left to the fantasy of children and the loneliness of schizos. It's yet another vibration layer of talking to at least myself. There is something broken about it. Sometimes the only way I can (or am willing to) communicate even to myself is through you, my medium in a medium.

I rarely trust my interlocutor with depth.<<ref "t">> I am frustrated by most ignorance, and I despise most malice; thus, I tend to find most communication exhausting. I fail to predict my interlocutors often, I'm an unreliable interpreter,<<ref "m">> and I have (perhaps seemingly) ridiculously high expectations.<<ref "e">> I have no idea how to bridge the gap between me and my audience, even with a [[ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱]] like this one and absurd patience from my audience. I am an abject failure here, even in speaking with myself. It's tragic that I'm a poor communicator (of what matters most) because it's my vocation.

I've seen enough signaling theory and other-mind skepticism to know the [[infinigress]]es I face as a realist.<<ref "i">> I don't feel so bad about those failures. I do what I can. But, there are things that are up to me: real failures that are mine alone. I could have intended better! I am mean when I shouldn't be. I fail to fittingly take into account the feelings of others (it would have been better for me to remain silent!). Niceness is a face, but lacking kindness is my real failure.

<<footnotes "t" "Though I'm sometimes foolishly charitable here too. It's tricky trying to hand over the keys to the kingdom [[irwartfrr]]. There can be a prudence to //Real//^^tm^^ [[sharing]] here that becomes morally complex to inspect. I disagree with Sir [[Zizek]]'s timeless claim (who knows how many have said it?) that reason cannot be fundamental to [[love]], but I agree that such a thing has limits for reasons that may be similar to his.">>

<<footnotes "m" "My daughter is obviously disappointed. As she does, I often purposely misinterpret what she says (as [[Tapeda]] points out), but there are simply too many cases where I take something literally or down the unintended road, things that sometimes even children would have understood correctly without even thinking. For all the big-brained shit in my head, I'm still retarded. I tried to tell [[kicks]], but I don't think he believed me (or, clearly, he totally does).">>

<<footnotes "e" "Not just moral requirements, but bandwidth, focus, a grind of sorts, explicit reliance upon [[faith]], searching, technical prowess, a breadth of or curiosity for knowledge, etc.">>

<<footnotes "i" "I hold some extreme views in philosophy of language and mind, and I have a hard time picking out what isn't information transmission in dialectics. Given doxastic involuntarism and how we can be responsible for shaping our unconscious aspects, I'm in a poor position to pick out how any action in physics isn't a communication, let alone the wild implications of metaphysical dialectics (toward [[The Absolute]]) wherein all things are conceptually related and communicate meaning to and through each other.">>
