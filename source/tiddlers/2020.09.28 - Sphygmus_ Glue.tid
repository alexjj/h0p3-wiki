>I love that about you. You really don't care about political power more than you're obligated to... I hold you to be a profoundly moral creature. I'm not sure what to do in your shoes either, as you know. I appreciate your struggle here.

I want to ack this paragraph, though I'm not sure what, if anything, to say in response. I agree, I want to maintain my lack of interest in internal political power -- I want to put a sense of distance between "who I am" and "who I am in and at work" (which is not to say that it's possible or even something I completely have control over).

I feel moral in the barest sense; I feel I don't live up to the others I know personally and through other media. I'm too often hypocritical and too often unwilling to sacrifice myself or my comfort, too often eager to resist or avoid. When faced with the question, "would you jump in front of a bus to save this row of people you don't know and have never met?" I'd like to think I could say yes, but I worry that in the moment, I have no honest way to know what I would do.

>I appreciate that you don't give a fuck that I'm that stupid sometimes

I think often that when and where I'm working around it or compensating for it (thinking of the few times you remark on this in your wiki reviews) it's less conscious and more habitual. Or maybe I'm also just stupid so yours makes sense to me :craughing: I wanted to write something in my wiki about a similar thing -- I think in some respects my way of being with other people is to be the glue. To be the listener, to ask questions, to pay attention, to draw others out... I don't know. Just a theory, and I don't socialize enough offline to have a base of evidence to support it, just moments here and there, lol. But that means being aware of and working around and with the way other people exist in themselves.. which is why it's relevant, lol.

>You're memory is vivid, illuminating, and crystal clear.

nono you've got it all wrong, my memory is shiiiite, and getting worse by the day. :craughing:

joking aside, I think my memory is very particularized and oriented, vivid and shining spotlights on certain parts of the map, which leaves gaps to be desired in other places. (Don't ask me to "construct an equation where y is the average cost for a year and x is the number of years since 1999" because the last math class I took was 8 years ago and I definitely don't remember anything anymore. :crying:) (ack! that paragraph makes me very happy to read.)

I think it would be fascinating for my family to meet yours. There are certain overlaps, and certain differences, and I bet the conversation would wander in many directions. My dad would probably not hesitate to wrestle with you, oh boy, and the rest of us would leave the room to go do other things as it got too heated and granular. :sweat_smile:

>I beg you to tease me more, btw.

I think this will definitely develop further with comfort over time! (I think Senpai might carry a connotation of some amount of awe and I felt this way reaching out with my first letter and for a good while afterwards. I think in some sense I see this awe in the many Others who reach out to you; I'm not sure what to make of it.) Anyway, I look forward to lovingly giving each other shit. :mellow:

>I'm serious: I'm going to learn about [[sharing]] from you.

Wah! What is there to learn about sharing from me?! Other than being self-deprecating, I look forward to learning from you what you learn from me.

> I still don't actually understand what makes playing a music instrument sexy.

Would you like me to write an essay about it? I could write an essay about it. I'm always trying to analyze in this realm. :craughing: 

In general I think it tends to be used as a symbol for emotional depth in media -- eg. in the tv show "Lucifer", Lucifer is the bad boy devil who isn't in touch with his emotions but we see that "softer side" of him in the moments where he turns to playing the piano as emotional expression. Andhadhun's main character featured a musician, but here there is a darker, more threatening side to the "musicians are sexy" trope -- passion is the allure, but if the lover is too passionate or invested in their art, then the other lover feels threatened or jealous of the passion. Andhadhun also features the "artist uses unresolved longing as inspiration for creation" (not something that makes musicians sexy, just something that comes with artist-love-stories).

Another angle: playing an instrument (generally?) requires attention and care, so the admirer places themselves in the position of being the instrument, imagines themselves the recipeient of that attention and care.

From a personal angle: damn I do love me some hands (so aesthetically attractive, ie. generally not sexy but very very nice/pleasing to watch & observe) and often playing instruments shows off hands so well. the other thing that shows off hands really well is MTG streams :craughing: (me sitting in my college friend's room watching the pro tours etc he'd have on the TV and judging/admiring each player's hands. there's a familiarity and ease and practice with the cards that's visible in the way hands move, and ah, the way players gesture to pass their turns and how that varies from person to person).

> Also, I am reminded that I was glad to say your offline name out loud...

So surreal! (in a wonderful way.) I have no idea what to say about it.

In general it's a unique occurrence to hear my name offline, whether from someone speaking to me in person or hearing it in passing. It's something I'm bad at, saying other people's names -- of course, I know the "Win Friends & Influence People" idea that saying someone's name is key to leaving a positive impression / making them feel noticed and valued -- but I either feel awkward about it, don't know where to fit it into conversation, or just straight up forget.

Of course, as I've mentioned, with my met-online friends, their username becomes their name to me in the majority of cases, so it's likely I'll just keep calling you h0p3 and I have no preference for name you use. :mellow: (I think my mom doesn't understand all my talking about my online friends, including you, but she's gotta put up with my nattering about it anyway :laughter: (one hilarious thing my college friends pointed out to me: I would always say, "oh mom this or mom that" in conversation and they're like "... you mean 'your mom' not just 'mom', right?" -- I'd never had to think about that before! I'm pretty consciously trained now though, lmao.))

> I will think about it if you want me to.

No need at this time, but if it becomes pressing I'll ask for your thoughts!

> You could go for a nickname. Talk about ol'obi, he's the one.

I thought of this! I was thinking about Sidian or Sidon or Obsidia or Sidia... idk! though I like Flint & it's growing on me.

> Btw, if I get to choose what we will do together sometimes, I want to walk with you, literally. ...If you ever want to, you choose when.

YES I'd love this. I want to walk and talk around my lake trail loop while you walk on your trail. :) 

Re: timing... if during the week, would probably have to be at 6:15ish your time, given the rate of the sun going down earlier and earlier. :crying: I wouldn't want to interrupt your evening routine though!! so maybe the weekend is better? Looks like the high for this coming Saturday is 63 so maybe a mid-afternoon walk would be nicer for me, 3 or 4 your time maybe?

Ayyy it is time for me to go to bed now -- this reply took longer to write than I anticipated :sweat_smile: (though it's not surprising). Was going to put this as a note in my wiki instead of messaging it, buuut emoji support, lol. Feel free to plop it into yours as a note instead of chatlog, if it works better.

oh and

> Yeah, I appreciate the need for space and time there. Take all you need.

as always, thank you! (It's probably a completely inefficient form of communication and most people would probably go :thonk: "just use chat?" but I love the simple working possibility of leaving notes in Carpe Diem. It's possible with you, and maybe with chame or kicks, but I love that it is possible. Am I splaining it right?)
