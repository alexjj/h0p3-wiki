title: 2022.09.26 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: much wittier on a delay and without eye contact

<<<
Been waiting for 1.5 hours to push brix, but my offspring are taking showers back to back (not together*). [[TTTOTW]]. ~~Un~~predicted eggs and rice (nothing like what [[5c0ut]] can make*) with root beer! [[TTTOTW]].

A wild [[Fairweather Manchild]] appears...

[[TTTOTW]]. //Star Wars//.  Gonna try to make it through the entire set one last time. Cleaning up our torrents, checking in on deduplication, as I saw no changes in size (though I freed plenty up). Looks like 2TB is free (though, much of it saved for seedbox buffer).

Woke at noon? //Skintime// with my sympaticon. [[Morning Routine]]. Cleaning and bandaging wounds. //Star Wars//. Looking at the same piece of media over the years is a time for reflection.

Quesadillas. Planning with my daughter. Up to her what she does with her life. `/nod`.

A wild billy-gqvup appears...

[[TTTOTW]].

Dadnap at 3? Woke at 5?

[[Family Time]] was only rocky at the beginning. One thing that stood out to me was how much I had already discussed the contents of my week in [[The Alien Asylum]]. Not many surprises, except what the [[Link Log]] may bring. 

//The Sandman//. I enjoy hearing my daughter predict much of the show and analyze the story. 

A //Star Wars//. May it be the last time I watch this episode as well. 

Sleep by 10:30?

Woke at 2:45. I am awake. It was enough for now.

A flash.

Cleaning wounds. [[TTTOTW]]. Caffeine. //Star Wars// has me thinkin' about Yoda penis, ofc. Wonder if he can wield it with as much skill as that lightsabre. I bet. A gentle force choke up on it. How wrinkly a worm he has. The story makes no sense, even less than it did before. I've imposed too much on it, and not for reasons I respect in hindsight.

Thinking about [[Fairweather Manchild]]. I am not sure how much analysis I ought bring to the table here. Considering how high my relationship failure rate is, I should probably be hedged-conservative. Address only what the [[other]] explicitly brings to my attention. idk.

Mi amor is awake. She is anxious about how much has to be done today, how little control she has over her schedule, the flood. Beyond reassurance, thinking with her, listening: there is nothing I can do besides limit how much time she has to spend working on things on the house or with me. 

I had pizza. [[TTTOTW]]. Watched more them //Star Wars// as well. //Skintime// with my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]]. My daughter and son were workin' on the beast, lookin' up why the transmission fluid had a different color. They argued I only had them do this because I was try to sneak getting practice of taking care of their own future vehicles. Sure. `/nod`. Right. That sounds like me.

Shopping @ Aldi with my sympaticon. Lots of anxiety today. Felt off. Robust 8 in a tight onesie, tho, lawd. Was a fairly large shop, as we needed everything. 

Shopping @ Costco. Fizzy water. Tons of noodles (tom yum as well, yo). Bulk pork tenderloin may be cheapest there. Measurements for a trashcan, but it was too expensive. I got some thin thermal gloves (thin enough that I should be able to put big winter gloves over them) and 4 long johns to keep me warm. Lots of missing pieces. 

Delivery. [[TTTOTW]].

Shopping @ W-Entity with my sympaticon. Meds, lots of spicy noodles. The store was having trouble getting any cards to work, and the cashiers were all on the verge of tears. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

Went back to Costco. They had my sympaticon's fitbit. May she sleep soundly. Mi amor called on the way back, as we were both driving. Her day was absurd, including forgetting her credentials at home, not having any block of time for lunch (may she eat lunch during any meeting that overrides her normal schedule), some disappointment in a lack of peers among the first year students (wrestling with things one would think they'd already have done by now), her Mondays are almost entirely school-related rather than work-related at this point (which may be uncomfortable in dealing with SZ), and her pick for the Art librarian is going strong, too.

[[Family Gathering]] was good. We had nachos, and I even had a topo chico. Finished S2 of //House of Cards//, and both my offspring are falling asleep. Alright, that's enough. We got where we absolutely had to get to in the story. I can appreciate not enjoying the story at that age. We will move onto //Mr. Robot// now. 

Dadnap by 8:30?

Woke at 10. Fuck. Thought I was going to finally sleep. Nope. Meditation. Cleaning. [[TTTOTW]].
