; 1903-1969: Adorno

* There is no such thing as pure thought: thinking is a socio-historical form of activity, and there is not a universal standpoint to discern "truth".
* "Identity thinking" is misrepresenting reality by putting specific phenomena under general, abstract classificatory headings.
* "Identity thinking" is fundamentally concerned not to understand phenomena but to control and manipulate it.
* The source of today's disaster is the domination of nature and human beings by other human beings.
* A critique of modernity must also be a critique of premodernity; a turn towards the postmodern cannot simply be a return to the premodern.
* The instrumentalization of reason and the supremacy of "facts" established a single order: enlightenment is totalitarian (like myth).
* With the instrumentalization of reason and positivism, morality is put under the invalid, "meaningless" category of subjective knowledge.
* Intelligence is a moral category; the seperation of feeling and understanding dismembers man into function.
* The "culture industry" promotes domination by subverting the psychological development of the mass of people in capitalist societies.
* The commodities of the culture industry are increasingly standardized, formulaic, and repetitive in character.
* The standardization of music promotes a general condition of immaturity, prohibiting the exercise of any critical or reflexive faculties.
