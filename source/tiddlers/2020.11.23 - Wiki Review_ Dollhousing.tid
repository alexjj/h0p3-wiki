title: 2020.11.23 - Wiki Review: Dollhousing

** I have done a damned good job of preparing them to listen to their mother carefully in that space. Not many could see it, but I've provided all the crucial skepticism while still giving grounds for it. It's not easy to balance.

** There is a split between telic reasoning and political quietism. I see plenty shrug it off. I have a hard time empathizing or even visualizing a life like that: I've devoted so much of my life in the other direction. That's not a good enough reason, obviously, but vv. as well.

** My prediction is that [[MTG]] will fade out again. It seems to be woven more and more into our lives though. I can imagine a time when my son is actually a teenager, maybe an older one, where he will embrace the grind with me (though, I can imagine running out of steam for it...that would be interesting).

** Admittedly, I'm not feeling a strong urge to write in my wiki. It's not easy when I hate life, but it's a reason to hang onto life sometimes. When I'm enjoying myself, it's difficult to write at all sometimes. As I experiment with this habit, I lose some of my discipline too.

** Edited. It's fair to say I have most of these in some form or another but toned down. I wouldn't say they are moderated except by requirement. I get more sex than most men, definitely more skintime, more drugs, more food (and more variety), more picking out my favorite autists for various things, consumption out the ass really.
