title: 2021.06.30 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: A Day That Flew By

//I got a bunch of XOXOs today. It was a good day.//

Woke up. Lightning Struck again, very late. My people need to sleep. [[TTTOTW]]. I remembered to take the trash out. It was forgotten last week (and we're feeling it).

[[TTTOTW]] until she got up. She slept. I took her extra time she builds into her morning at the table. Woke my offspring, trying to help them start the day right (so easy to just head back to sleep). [[TTTOTW]]. Continued encouraging my offspring to be constructive (I failed, but I'm getting good at not feeling terrible about it). Set up to attend the [[metagovernance seminar|https://metagov.org/seminar/]], but the desire for sleep overtook my desire to listen. 

Woke at 1:30? Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]?

//The Walk// with my offspring was fun. We took a longer route today. I like when I don't say something, they engage each other. I'm allowed to drop out, fail to respond, just sit and think, and so forth. We continue to discuss positivism and categorical normativity embedded in epistemology (it's an absolute bloodbath). There's no way to think about economics wisely enough. It appears to be a primary topic for us at this point. Cool. I need to keep going with them, but I simply don't know enough (and they know that, thankfully).

Lightning. Yus. [[Music]] to my ears.

[[5c0ut]]'s having a rough day. We talked for a while. He's feeling bad about ~3 weeks of work in 5 months, his hopping has included unnecessary gaps, and that's taken a toll on him. This last employer's attempt to steal his wages has been the opposite of a cherry on top. The W-Entity is going to be steady and reliable, like the nursing home position, so I'm feeling [[hope]]ful. I'm hoping that a month from now, he'll have his DMV-based documentation complete. I'm still encouraging him to write. Lent him my timer. Suggesting 2 gapped pomos to encourage diffuse mode and splitting time between initial [[private]] writing and public. Vapelyfe, enabled me to be talkative.

Speaking with my regular PKMG [[anon]]. Finding a way to be useful despite what may be dishonesty. Making suggestions on [[ltf]].

Offspring prepped, and I only did minor work to make dinner with them. My daughter isn't hating having me in there with her as much. Noice.

[[Family Gathering]] in [[The Den]] again. Porkchops, potatoes+gravy, peas, melon, bubbly water. =). My offspring are severely enjoying //Arrested Development// now. Ask them if they want to stop, and they don't want to. Cool. One of the fundamental replayed metaethical questions of the 20's is: "what is cringe?" Plenty to think about in this classic. Both my offspring had to stand up and walk out of the room at least once because the pain is too great. 

//Skintime//+//The Office//. Morton's toe is feeling uncomfortable. Not sure how to describe it. An eww feeling when I put weight on that foot. That foot hasn't been doing well. My wife tried to fix it. 

Thunder without lightning and cooling rain. We were hoping the predicted storm would come and push the the temperatures down, but the forecasters were wrong, sadly.

Sleep by 9:30?
