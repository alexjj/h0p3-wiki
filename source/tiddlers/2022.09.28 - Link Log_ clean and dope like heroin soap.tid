*** It may matter what individuals think money refers to, indirectly and by feedback loops, especially insofar as the perceived normative value of those social activities are generated by those individuals to some [[dok]]. There is still a social construction here, but I'll agree it still misses the point. 
**** Further, you've not demonstrated why it's not still a form of a debt, fundamentally. I think it's wiser to say that, on average, money will point to debts of expenditures of human capital.
**** The objective normative evaluations of money (completely mind independent, unless we take Saint Hegel far here) are the source of its final meaning. You're not even close to capturing the //meaning// of money (which, I think you might agree to).
