*** History repeats itself. I adore how his automata modeling spirals toward it. And, I don't understand why people don't like his writing style (who cares what you think about his personality?). Another step toward what Saints Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Spinoza, Leibniz, and Hegel have been screaming about, the representation of the real, of formal necessity [[Itself]]. I can see why empiricists are scared.

*** We can all admire the desire for a universal language. He always closes with his Wolfram Language. :P. Never will be [[The Absolute]], but I adore what he reaches for here. The highest recorded IQ feller makes very similar moves. I do not know what is not language.
