[11:59 PM] chameleon: Yeah I'm trying my best
[11:59 PM] chameleon: Pacing and shuffling cards, lol


[12:00 AM] h0p3: You shuffle to stim? I have lots of objects that I play with as I pace (I spend ridiculous amounts of time doing it). Worry beads for me.
[12:14 AM] chameleon: Rolling dice, shuffling, saying mantras (using my mala) etc
[12:15 AM] chameleon: I don't pace much because it plays with hubby's anxiety :p

[5:36 PM] chameleon: fuck that, I wanna watch robotech
[5:37 PM] h0p3: haha
[5:37 PM] chameleon: I s'pose I should at least shower at some point. not now tho.
[5:37 PM] chameleon: powerful image

[5:37 PM] h0p3: It would be nice if AR goggles enabled us to watch while we engaged in the bullshit.
[5:38 PM] h0p3: I need to shower too. Generally, I am told I smell unacceptable (past the threshold of my normal halitosis and grunge, lol) before I do. It is what it is.
[5:39 PM] h0p3: What makes it a powerful image to you?
[5:41 PM] chameleon: the t-pose is one. the other is that there's some sort of defect so that she's very very pear shaped, like one of those old cartoon cartoons
[5:41 PM] chameleon: :pear:
[5:41 PM] chameleon: like dexter's mom
[5:44 PM] h0p3: Reminds me of a trust-fall, as though the shadow is ready to move with her.
[5:47 PM] chameleon: there are many better images. the broken-ness of this one is just appealing =w=.
[5:49 PM] h0p3: I hear that.
