** It may be useful to do a once over check on your work before [[h0p3ful Review]]. Some of these issues can be fixed in advance. Hard to do without enough sleep. =). I [[hope]] tonight will be better for you.

** This doesn't seem to be a significant improvement over 2019 or 2018. I agree that you need the basic timeline framework, but I think you can do better. Do you have nothing else to reflect upon in your day? Do you have nothing else you wish to remember? Doesn't anything stand else out to you?
*** You can't write a complete one (as you know), but this lacks some narrative elements. Imagine reading a book that only had your [[Carpe Diem]]s. What story does it tell?

** Maybe you should work toward a single document. We burn a lot of tiddlers, and I think it would make sense to start molecularizing more.
** Please check your [[TTP]]s, and you'll want to make sure that you are asking for feedback (don't wait for it) from your mother. 
** I appreciate that you pick out when you goof.

** I hope you'll push hard. It's really up to you. You have the chance to become excellent if you want.

** I am happy to see you trying to grow your understanding of the concept and history of fascism, [[2019.08.20 – Print Reading: Soviet facism.]].
** I'd be interested to see the evolution of your concept of warfare, [[2019.08.20 – Prompted Introspection: Judgement]]. I think it's a rich concept, and with more [[Saint Hegel]] under our belts, I think we'll be in a better position to consider the notion of [[power]] more clearly too.
