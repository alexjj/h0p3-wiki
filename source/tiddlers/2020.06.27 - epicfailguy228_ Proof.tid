Hello! How are you, h0p3? I’m an explorer of the deep Internet, in my country they are called "netstalkers"  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netstalking) (internet researchers), but I know that in English this has a negative meaning. We just research the network, collect, archive, maintain our channels, someone loves a “gopher”, someone loves BBS, there are many branches. We are an Internet subculture, we have a short story, only few people know about it, because even the very name of the subculture is confused and gives a negative color to the community itself. :(
I can tell you more, I’m leading the channel to tg myself, I posted your resource there, because once I came across by chance. I am also an ethical hacker, participating in 2600. I was interested in your site, I spent a lot of time studying it, but I didn’t understand much. You can briefly tell what the story \ idea \ meaning is tied there. Here is a link to my channel (https://t.me/darknet_prison) and to me (https://t.me/exp10iter)

Oh, sorry, I talks "hacker", but I read in text "Lifehacker"
