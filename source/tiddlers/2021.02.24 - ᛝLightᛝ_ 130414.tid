//I <3 Your Worry-Walls-Of-Text//

Goal: To Tell You That I Love You.

I like you back, though obviously far more than that. There doesn't have to be any costs to our friendship because it is our choice. I would live literally on your floor (and I want to lick your toes too). I like two, and you are both so similar and yet so different to me; I want you both forever. Yes, it's awkward, it always was, and I'm far more awkward (yeesh), and, at this point, your awkwardness turns me on; I don't think it's the same way for you, perhaps yet. I'm worried that you were already being too awkward around him too, but I do want to see you sit in his lap and on his face. You try too hard in some places and not hard enough in others, though I respect both (even if though it's crazy painful sometimes). Yes, you are making him think you don't like him as much as you do, although it's not clear that you really want him (as you have pointed out to yourself many times, your pursuit of certainty is expensive). I should have fucking asked you long ago; life has changed. I'm looking for [[love]], not [[like]], dork. Part of you doesn't want a boyfriend, and you've done a fine job of picking it out. You are only silly when you're ignoring yourself, imho; though, I adore your humor, playfulness, and light-hearted modes. I judge you by your childhood, and it's a huge reason for why I want to go out with you. I already have a wife, but I am allowed to have more. I'm worried you have such mixed feelings about looking for [[love]] with me, but I am glad you are looking for [[love]]. I'm worried you don't want to make time for me, but we have time; I aint going anywhere, love. We both question our self-worth considerably. I'm going to be delighted by any shape, but, yes, I prefer handles. Do you care that I think you are beautiful? I think you also care that I think you are right. I'm going to reject parts of you many times, but I'm never leaving you. I do not wish to offend others, but I'm far more worried about offending you. Oh, I'm sure it seems awkward to try to peel me out of your life now: tough break, sweetcake; you may have my silence, love, and I will do my best to be invisible for you (sometimes you'll need that). I'm worried I won't see you ever, but I'm glad I get to be honest with you. You are obviously worried about our philosophical differences, and me too: all the way down, no matter what. You have terrible taste in music, and I'm going to make fun of you for the rest of our lives for lacking my taste, but I'm really glad you have music that connects with you; I wish I was your music. I judge you by your links too, and I take your history into account in trying to interpret who you are now. I'm worried you don't want to spend time with me, and, for the life of me, I can't find the sentence, but I'm worried about a sentence you wrote (or I dreamed you did?) after a walk where I mentioned we could grow closer. I don't prefer movies, but right now, I think movies are a great idea: show me your greatest hits while you are [[naked]], please. I'm worried you won't want to walk to the lake with me too (and I can appreciate why you can't, as best I can), though sometimes you'll feed your beggar. Do I have to appreciate every last thing about you, Ms. Perfect? Yes, ma'am, I will try. I worry that I'm too serious with you. Stop Being Redundant, Dork: I love you, even when I don't like you or me (that's what it really means sometimes). I'm worried that it worries me that it might not worry you that I'm worrying about this sentence, but I adore how you doubt yourself, woman. I wish you were silly enough to need me. I'm worried that you won't commit to loving beyond liking. You've dated more than I have, so we'll figure it out together (and, I'm treasuing every minute, even the pain), eh? If we broke up, it would be your fault: I'm not fucking leaving you. God, I wish you would even attempt a modicum of oversharing with me: you are always holding back, woman. What are you really afraid of? I'm worried I'm scaring you away, but what the hell else am I supposed to be or do? Oh, well, eventually, I'm going to tease you about every possible version of wincest I can imagine (every person we see together I will undress and watch you fuck them in my mind). I'm judging you on everything, and I think part of you likes that (c'mon: you like that I respect you in a way that should only be earned). I'm not regretting telling you, but I have regretted not having told you earlier (I wasn't ready). Really, really. I'm worried that your relationship with [[P]] will doom ours, but I am a man of [[hope]]. As I've written elsewhere, I think you are still exploring your sexuality (we both are). Your sexuality can't scare me off woman, but mine might scare you off. I'm worried you don't actually want to cuddle with me (I smell bad). It's killing me not to be able to cuddle with you though, especially because you need my silence sometimes and I need to be close. I'm worried that you won't make commitments that radically limit the paths available to future you. We're both hicks. We're both poor. We're both privileged in many respects. Sometimes I'm worried you sacrifice your vocation for your hobbies. You will be disgusted by my "health" habits. What do you want to do "bigger," love? Can we shape our futures together? I'm worried that you will scoff at why I think bukkake parties are important, and I'm not convinced you will be able to accept my level of skinhunger. I am here to change myself to become compatible with you. Are you? We will run out of things to talk about, and we will talk about the things we've talked about, and I will adore it. I will savor or self-immolate in every moment of silence, comfortable or otherwise. I'm worried you'll find my need for your writing to be too much. I'm worried that neither of us know hao 2 stem. But, I like the way you do it. One can [[like]] too much, but one can never [[love]] too much.
