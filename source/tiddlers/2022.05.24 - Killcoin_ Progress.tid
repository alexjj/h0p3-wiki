My progress in becoming a hiki in the basement. Well on my way. =).
Dope. Losing weight is hard.
How you been doing it so effectively?
Is it easier on your back?
Mr Graybeard! I’m jelly, I wish my beard would crap or get off the pot when it comes to getting gray.
It is hard. Basically starving. I got the coof back in February and it messed up my appetite. So I just kinda kept the same starvation diet going. It’s probably “intermittent fasting” if you get technical. The only way I can eat a regular meal is if I’m cannibated. Otherwise I get sick feeling after a few bites.
Ha
Wonder diet right there.
Just don't eat.
Who knew?
Still messed up appetite?
You do feel hungry, yeah?
Yeah, I’m not sure if it’s because I’ve starved myself for so long or it’s a remnant. I’m not jabbed so.
Yeah, I get so hungry I dry heave. I have to eat something. I also found these RX bars at bargain hunt and have been chowing down on them. Natural food like fruit or veggie is easier on my stomach.

These things are delish
That does sound good.
It's all natural so I don't feel bad if I eat two and get 500 ish calories.
Not all calories are created equally.
Not always cheaper to be on a decent diet either.
Unfortunately
Can you talk on the phone or niet?
Yes, sir.
