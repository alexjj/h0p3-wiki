; 1712-1778: Rousseau

* Man in a state of nature is a noble savage; human beings are born good, loving justice and order.
* Civilization corrupts men, by repressing feelings and imposing artificial modes of thinking.
* We cannot be uncivilized, so we should change the civilization to make instincts and feelings free.
* Education should not discipline a child's natural tendencies; it should encourage them.
* The tools of education should not be books but practice: experience of people and things.
* Education should take place in family, not school; and through love, not rules and punishment.
* Religion is a matter of the heart, not the head; emotion should dominate instead of reason.
* Human society is a collective being with a will of its own.
* Laws should be made by everybody deliberating and voting, expressing the "general will".
* The "general will" might not be good for any individual, but the citizen is subordinate to it.
* The rulers can give the task of execution to whoever they choose; a monarch, politicians, etc.
* A population at large might constitute an ill-informed, short-sighted legislative body.
* "Legislators", charismatic leaders who understand the general will, can draft legislation and persuade people.
