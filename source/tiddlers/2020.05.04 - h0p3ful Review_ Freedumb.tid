*[[2020/05/03 -- Antipleonasm Analysis: Freedom is Slavery]]
** Wait. Are you being serious or facetious? You've been on the interwebs too  long.
*** It'll rot ur brain.
** What kinds of freedom can only be bestowed but not achieved? What kinds are most important? 
*[[2020/05/03 -- Prompted Introspection: Too Short]]
** [[Pussy]].
*[[2020/05/03 -- Life Log: Cimmanom]]
** Hard to find things to say about [[Family Time]]. It was only 9 hours long. 
*** Reminds me of some church services I've attended. Lawd.
*[[2020/05/03 -- Wiki Log: That Demon]]
** No, don't get me wrong, I would shred that argument and skin it alive were it the fitting time. It wasn't [[h0p3ful Review]] time though; I was just admiring your mistake from afar during [[Family Time]]. =)
** Bob tomorrow. Do you know what you are doing? What's the gameplan?
*** No. Can you try it in VM, please?
**** Given the number of times we've talked about this, I am annoyed that you don't have one at the ready. It's 10 minutes of work. Don't forget. 
***** I recognize you are limited on the machine you have (though your desktop would be fine, and it's just as easy on Windoze). Or, use mine, headlessly. We've had to rollback in production twice now. Sandbox, stage, and practice that shit. Third time pays for all, love. 
*** TW, Bob, and NPM (you want to be able to walk up to a machine and bang it out)
*** Your brother will be shadowing. If he fails to ask a question, you'll have to pick it out with him. 
** Seems like [[VIXI]] is leading an RP in some sense, right?
** If your Bob is eating your lunch, it's time to punch him in the face.
** Btw, when did you become interested in Tumblr?
*** Drama? wat.
*** You ever see my Tumblrs? Shit was deep, yo.
*[[School Plan.plan]]
** Please break this up into clean bullet-points.
*[[School Plan / Spring 2021.plan]]
** Hey, don't forget to fill this out. 
** What are you thinking for math?
*** I've been here enough with you. You'll have to make choices. [[vidyas]] and learning on your own would be amazing. I'm willing to do crash courses with you too. Of course, the bare minimum is being able to ace the ACT/SAT mathematics sections (it's by far the easiest sections of those exams); you could just study for them (lame AF, but you will be studying for these exams no matter what here soon [you need a free ride to school, homie, and you might as well make sure it's a damned good one]).
*[[School Routine]]
** You've got quite a bit of writing for your mother. I [[hope]] you woman-up and bang it out. 
*** Word.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** Do you still agree to your claims in [[Cats]]?
** I forgot about the structure in [[2017/05/04 -- Life journal]]. 
*** What do you think about it three years later?
