; 1859-1941: Henri Bergson

* Human beings should be explained from the perspective of evolution.
* Life is like a current passing from germ to germ through the medium of an organism which is like an excrescence.
* Our senses do not give us objective representations; they stimulate behavior for survival.
* Evolution is directed by a drive ("Ã©lan vital") towards greater individuality and complexity.
* Everything changes; the flow of time is fundamental to reality, to life.
* We have direct intuitive experience of time, independent of conceptual thinking and sensual input.
* We know that we have free will because we have direct intuitive knowledge about our decisions to act.
* Our intellect artificially breaks up time and space into manageable units to handle them - very useful for everyday life, business, and science.
* The partitioning of the world does not show us reality; real time ("duration") and space are continuous and irreducible.
* The present contains nothing more than the past; without the survival of the past into the present there would be no duration, but only instantaneity.
* We live in two worlds; our inner experience of the continuum, and our intellect's partitioning.
