There is a universal isness to a universal ought. And, particular to each of our contexts, there is an ought to how we further ought discover what is. Those particular objects objectively and eternally obtain external to all subjectivities (and, arguably, is computed in virtue of at least the form of all subjectivities [[irwartfrr]], except perhaps [[The Absolute]] on the hard problem). We will fail to compute that which requires infinite computation, but pursuing the claim of its irrationality cannot be justified without being subject to the same problem. Making peace with never completely and consistently reaching the foundation does not require us to deny there is such a thing. Even the attempt to claim there is not truth begged the question.

Language use only defines a word in that the combined (and often conflicting) intentions of its practicing users fit an objective map of interpretations that itself is mapped onto the form of all signification. The construction can't be completely arbitrary or self-defined, as a construction must be built on a foundation. What is not [[The Infinite]] [[Itself]] functions like an organ that is what it is, in no small part, by doing what it does, in the context of the whole organism. I still don't know what is not linguistic.

Wondering if the true contradiction inherent to Dasein is a qualia evolving around sequences of choices in drilling down to perceive a continuum that only partially reduces to the discrete, a top-down schizo unification, with an "up to us" of how we sample the underlying metaphysics we can access. The Will to [[Salience]].

Paraconsistently, the extension of predicates does not complementarily determine the anti-extension, requiring a separate specification of the set of which it is false. Feels like a blackhole we have to see into.

Dialectical Metaphysics^^tm^^ may be so "fast" that it's not even a transfer of information. I do not know what time means there, though apparently, it is our plight to talk about it.
