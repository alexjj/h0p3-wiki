title: 2021.02.02 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: We Take Those

* Fireman Time!
* Try To Take Over The World
* [[Dreamcloud]] perhaps isn't that interested. Hard to tell. Still thinkin' it might be that one person who asked me for an interview. 
** If it is you, well, hello.
* Sleep by 3:30
* Woke at 8
* AFireman Time!
** Need to find charger.
* Shoveling snow
* //Skintime//
** Dumped her body on me twice today. Everything I want in that small package. Gibme.
* Try To Take Over The World
* Bugging offspring plenty.
* Nap
* My wife works so hard from home, even when she doesn't have to. Refuses to not do her best (all my loves share this in common). 
** Continued to argue to let it go. Vocation is hard to argue with. 
* Inform the Men!
** Clutching Ragdoll Hardfuck for half an hour. Everything I got. Pure bliss.
* Meditation
** I've got that beareded coomer face
* Shower of the gods!
** I think I need to put up for hooks. 5 people, 1 bathroom. Everyone but me has long hair and real routines. I have 19-in-1 irish spring dollarsto junk, and I just want to re-use my wife's washcloth.
* Called [[JRE]]
** Marriage certificate acquired, Friday is the thing. Adoption soon after.
** Boys are sick, doctor laughed at 99th percentile weight, losses in communication behavior from Matthew
** Δ⁸ discussion
** Chill overall. Thinking about [[Sphygmus]]. He asked, I answer.
* [[Family Gathering]]
** [[MTG]], Daughter's Affinity vs Pox; 35 damage t3, full lockouts the next two. Hard to balance this one. 
** Ribs, asparagus, wedges, cranberry sauce (best I've ever had, she needs to write the recipe down as is).
* Adults just chillin in the living room.
** Wife thinkin' about writing the letter. She doesn't want it to be problematic. Not sure what to say either. I'm curious.
* Cleaning and Organizing
** Primary tooltote made whole again. Weeding tools out. It's done right by us this move. That box + cordless drill + driver set has handled most of the work I've had to do.
* Put my wife to bed. qtpi. 
* Talking with [[AIR]]
** [[Hereditary]] discussion. A layer I didn't say much about. Will speak with [[Sphygmus]] about it next time, perhaps. 
*** Thought about her together a lot.
** Walking through life, planning.
* Podcast with [[Dreamcloud]]
** Seems like it didn't work. Great discussion though. He had little idea who he was speaking with, I'm afraid. Glad to meet him.
** Interests in schizophrenia (his diagnosis), muta's vid, neurotypicality and maladaptivity, IP, academia, [[ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱]], substance use and creation, [[Games]], capitalism, and more.
