title: 2020.11.07 - Prompted Introspection: Decorcum

!! What is your favorite holiday ornament or decoration? What makes it so special to you?

With gravity, simulcrams of fertile females filled and covered head to toe in cum.<<ref "f">> You know I'm a simp, Lady Melisandre. Pornographic decoration is my favorite; I don't want a cute joke, I want it to inspire lust. It's something I can celebrate about being human. The daoists are quietly wrong about the nature of virtue, but I'm sure even they would admire going with the flow of the evolution of our species' psychology on this one. I'm glad to embrace it. I don't take holidays or most images seriously, and this is a reasonable enough midpoint.
