** `/thumbs-up`. I've been struggling with mine too. Keep up the hard work of doing your best. It's a mind-bendingly hard problem.

** Ha "I'm just trying my best here" lol. =)
** Go read the book. It is my female donor's favorite. I suggest it may unlock many things for you. 
*** Literature is a place you could also become great. If you don't go the [[Rust]] direction (though perhaps even if you do), you could be a rockstar in lit. You already speak the hardest language of the humanities well enough to gently wrestle with the literature professors (though they will correct your rhetoric, and that is on the assumption you are going to write drafted articles of significant length for them).
** I'm also taken by this quote, and I appreciate your analysis of it.

** Principal-agent problems all the way down. [[TOP]] is not a joke.

** You still speak with Melo, [[2019/07/30 -- Writing Log]]?
*** Thinking about the histories of our [[friend]]ships can be expensive.
** [[2017/07/30 -- Sibling Empathy Log]] reminds me so much of our current initial prompt in [[Family Log]] and [[Kitty Kat Korner]] and even [[CTS]]! =) 
*** No idea how to tag it.
** Do you like how empathic you are?
*** I am glad that you are a mediator and person who consistently seeks justice.
** [[2018/07/30 -- Badass Log]] is outstanding. I feel like I see these in your [[Life Log]]s and [[YTDL]]s for years after too. I'm glad you value this about yourself.
** You have much stronger opinions about your appearance compared to [[2018/07/30 -- Battle Body Log]].
*** It's crazy that even that bland commentary produces the image for you. 
** Couple years with zsh and nvim, [[2018/07/30 -- Computer Science Log]]. What do you think now?
*** We were just talking about how we really barely even use how far these tools go today, incidentally.
*** You know, I've encountered plenty of folks who stop using configs (or complex ones at least) for their text editors. `vi` shows up in plenty of tight spots.
*** As you have heard me say before, I think you should take emacs seriously now. Push for it. I can imagine a master of elisp would be well-positioned to craft a lot of things on-the-fly. I suggest you may need something to match TW underneath: that's some slim pickins.
**** You also are well-positioned to build it from scratch, if you are feeling "to-the-nines" about it. I am simply unqualified to know how to do that well enough. I suggest becoming proficient with all of the alternative competing tooling, collecting a set of images of what you would need (help you not re-invent the wheel or help you walk down the efficient paths). I would write that tool in [[Rust]] though. I would also start by understanding the Rust Library landscape: skid the fuck out of it to prototype. I suggest that for the foreseeable future, there will always need to be someone who can read+write well at that level.
