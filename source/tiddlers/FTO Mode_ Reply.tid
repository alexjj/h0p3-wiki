//A Robust^^tm^^ Reading-the-room NPC Energy Principle. A "speak when I'm spoken to" mentality. A Non-Performative Matching-Cooperativity [[Gradual]]ly DeÃ«scalating Tat Demonstration; feel free to show me how it's done. To some [[dok]], I am exercising what I believe is a moral right (if not obligation) to remain [[silent]] when I do. You are not put on read, and I am not exercising any explicit or implicit [[Ol' Yeller Clause]]s granted to me. May we [[wrestle]] wisely, always.//

This reactive style is the result of a broken state. I'm pulling more than my fair [[share]], and I've sufficient evidence to see I'm not [[respect]]ing my own [time, energy, autonomy, and purpose]. When you do at all, I don't [[trust]] the way in which you reciprocate: not just with me, but //The World//. I predict I won't be initiating conversations or sub-conversations,<<ref "n">> generating notifications, volunteering more information than I already do, explaining how I think and feel, nor defending myself in discourse. I predict I will be agreeing, repeating, diverting, distracting, reassuring, reminiscing, repeating, only doing what you find comfortable, (if at all) only ever requesting without expectations, or suggesting/encouraging with no direct negative feedback. It is a quasi-unidirectional approach. You're not alone. To the best of my abilities, given my other responsibilities, I am there when you really want me there. If you want to know my opinion, thoughts, feelings, plans, or anything I've not stated: you're gonna have to explicitly ask me.<<ref "a">> Even as we border on [[smalltalk]], may I serve you well, [[nomad]]. At the very least, may we turn what is sad or worse into what is [[beautiful]] or [[better|Good]].
