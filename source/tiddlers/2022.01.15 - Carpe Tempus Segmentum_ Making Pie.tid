title: 2022.01.15 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Making Pie

//Skintime// with [[ASK]] + Vapelyfe + dried cherries + //Samsara//. She adored the [[music]], but she actually fell asleep in the movie! I am glad it is highly rewatchable, assuming she wants to.* Put her to bed. 

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor + [[TTTOTW]] (something I've not done in a long time). It's the weekend, so my offspring are loud (trying not to be, but you know how it is) and playing with friends online (from the sounds of it, my daughter is on her headset just plainly VCing, as seems to be a growing preference, `/nod`).

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! The power went out in the neighborhood at an inopportune time. Rolling through the night thereafter. [[TTTOTW]].

Sleep by 5:15.

Slept like the fucking wind. Woke at 1. I needed that. 

//Skintime// with mi amor. Fireman Time!

[[TTTOTW]]. Chat with [[T-Money]]. Got a tiktok channel up about his doggo.

Assignments.

Shopping @ W-Entity with mi amor. Kelly the Cashier had plenty to say to my questions. Been crazy since October. She blames those on unemployment, points out she can't get overtime, and has a "done with it" attitude, no doubt. We picked up candy, bread, butter, soap, seasoning, etc. My god, it is cold AF out there. -13 windshield. 

//The Great// + //Skintime// with mi amor. Had bread, potato salad, and water. Third time through the show, and I'm still enjoying it. Story hits different this time.

Stage 3 of makin pie. I disappointed [[ASK]] with how little I understand about the science of baking. She's a patient teacher. I'm hoping folks will like it (I'd be surprised if they didn't). Hand-mixer was extremely convenient.

Dialectics with [[ASK]] and more chats with [[T-Money]].
