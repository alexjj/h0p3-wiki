Fireman Time! continued. [[TTTOTW]]. Feeling a bit sad. Interpersonal asymmetries are often necessary though, and I appreciate that. 

My daughter continues to stay up too late, and I can hear her very clearly. I am, just, like, the worst for ask-telling her to sleep. If you get your work done and other eudaimonic functions operate correctly, I don't care what your sleep schedule looks like. You know the drill.

Fruit and beverage. Didn't even peel that kiwi. Just made love to it with my mouth then tore the flesh right off the skin. 

Bro wanted a game. Torrented. Muhfuckin 87 MB/s tonight! They fixed something since the upgrade. Can't upload for shit still.

Sleep, deep, hard, long (sounds just like sleep, eh? :P). I know I dreamt, but I don't know of what. Fireman Time! 

My Intruder is passively watching me today. =D. y u m.

⁸Δ⁸ + Vapelyfe (get the party started), [[Morning Routine]], Hugs'n'Bugs, We tried for a walk, but she was too cold. Tried a massage, and the same (and, I'm not convinced the massage was helpful - she was so loose already, though still in pain). //Skintime// devoured.

Match with [[j3d1h]]. G1: Disk, Elspeth was enough. G2: Scales, Top, CoW, Chasm, Belcher, Elspeth, Heath at work with a hand of bombs, hardlock into the ages. 

Clarify sleeping requirements and so forth. I am the worst. 

Chill with [[Scout]]. Vapelyfe of the good stuff. Thinking about TW, TW5-Bob, wrote instructions, and walked through. Lots to explore.

Send my daughter to bed. She is annoyed with me.
