Laundry. [[TTTOTW]]. No idea what time I fell asleep. Slept hard, but nightmares. Ugh. One day, I will forget or it won't happen, I hope, or it just won't matter. I can't wait. Up for 15 minutes, but back to sleep. Half-brained. Got up at 11? 


They did a special job stacking the canned goods, and one of the shelves appears permanently damaged (beyond mere warping, it's unstable). We'll need to redo it. Quietly nudging them through working on the vehicles. 

[[Family Time]] was smooth. [[5c0ut]] smashes through the stack faster than everyone; probably reading in advance. Son is giving me [[hope]] with his schoolwork (and my daughter's isn't empty). Been here before. Not going to get them too high. Lots of laughs today. 

We finished the Indiana Jones trilogy. I've gotta agree with [[k0sh3k]]. Lost Crusaders is the best of them. Of course, my offspring predicted far more than I could ever at that age. They will surely be bored of everything I know and adore any day soon now. Also, //Skintime//. 

Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Scraping full histories on some of these Discord servers is absurdly slow, even while parallelized (interesting to see how what should be hidden information becomes revealed with this tool). No ban yet though.

My wife told me to stop making her laugh because she's still mad that I was digesting her hair. Do NOT smile. 

Reminded my offspring that they need to sleep. Fruit. [[TTTOTW]].

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Spoke with [[The Dark Passenger|2021.07.26 - Anonymous: Dark Passenger]] for hours. Sleep by 4? 

Woke at 11. Dreams have been vivid. Meditation. Fireman Time! Cleaning. [[TTTOTW]].

Saw her go outside. I went to look. The bowl wasn't airtight, they were partially escaping. They were pissed. We kept our distance from it. She talked with me about PT. Several of the recommended stretches are in [[Fitness Routine]]. =). Of course, my favorite part is the detailed explanations of another woman touching her. y u m. Hopefully, strengthening particular muscles will help in the end? I don't know. 

//The Walk// with my offspring. Vapelyfe. Not much to talk about for school. We had a good time (though a problem with my foot...). After the shitty part and our planning, it was pleasant. Too much rabbitholing for me the remember. 

[[TTTOTW]].

Prepped meal with offspring. My daughter lied to me again today (about the bathroom). Caught out, no remorse, no ownership. Just a "shut up." (I'm trying not to smile at this point, however, failing to be accountable steps over my line). 

Chilled with her downstairs. //Skintime// + //The Office//.

Offspring were supposed to finish dinner up, but their timing was off today. Commandeered the kitchen and sent them to work on the other task we had agreed upon downstairs (that never got finished either, but at least it was made safer). [[k0sh3k]] worked on the mangoes, and I did the rest. No time for potato soup. 

[[Family Gathering]] sans [[5c0ut]]. Thick porkchops, potatoes, watermelon (surprisingly mushy, a rare exception), mangoes (these were starting to go bad, so I'll cut back, maybe mangoed-out), and a salad. //Arrested Development//. Also, my hand has been forced. If they complete their schoolwork this week, my "punishment" that my offspring picked out will be watching the 4th Indiana Jones movie, which I've never completed, and lord willing (and my prediction), I never will have to :P. I would, of course, be happy to be effectively trolled in this manner. You got it.

Dadnap. You know the one. That burlyslut can't keep his fucking eyes open to save his life while watching even the most enjoyable [[vidya]] with his inner-tribe. Everyone's safe, so he's safe, so what he do? He falls asleep. Retard-grade sleep. It was good.

Woke at 11. Dreaming hard, went to find pillow but had to take sleeping mask off to find it, the light was too bright, and I couldn't get back. Dreams hit a wall like a tinfoil locomotive and crumpled up on me visually. I could sense myself sensing it, and that all it wrote. Woke at 11.

My daughter was still bouncing around upstairs (happy just in case she doesn't have to put up with any of us :P). She agreed that I shouldn't have to argue about the matter with her considering she didn't finish her schoolwork. Cool. I can still hear her up there. `/smh`. That person. 

Creeping up on running out of memory on [[m16]]. `/sigh`. At least the browsers started to cannabilize their parts in failures //this time// before we hit Loonix's dreaded OOM. [[TTTOTW]] + Alan Watts.
