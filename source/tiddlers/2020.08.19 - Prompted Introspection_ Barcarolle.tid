!! What is one of your favorite songs and why?

My [[Music: Library]] has sadly shrunk, but I'm glad to see it makes more sense. I've been trying to find more songs that would fit, but it seems unlikely that I will find many more favorites ([[hope]]fully, I'm wildly wrong!). [[Rachmaninoff - Barcarolle|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcdQvEJIs28]] is a special piece of music to me. I've played many Rachmaninoff songs, but I was never able to play this one. It's stupidly hard to play. It's actually how I knew I shouldn't go further in piano. I just listen to amazing pianists play it like a kid watching some NBA player dunk instead. 

This song is uplifting, magical, and it blurs. I adore that I sometimes can't distinguish the notes. I'm drowned in sound and impressions. I am transported with this song. There are times where I don't even know where I am when I hear it. I get lost in it. My respiratory system still flutters when I hear it. Is that even a piano? Surely, it is not. I don't know what it is. It is a rare [[gem]] that can continue to inspire [[awe]] for decades.
