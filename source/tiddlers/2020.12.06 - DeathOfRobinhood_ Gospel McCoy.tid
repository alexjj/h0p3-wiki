Dear h0p3,

Thank you for your kind words. I'm grateful I'm not as bad as I could be (or have been) at all times.

A couple of fictional characters that have lit up my salience-receptors are Alyosha Karamazov and Prince Myshkin; two unimpeachable Christ-figures from Dostoevsky's canon. I yearn to be bread for my neighbour's souls (but recoil at being broken). Often I see a lot of myself in those characters' respective foils: Dmitri in his capacity to build momentum on his locomotive of despair, and Rogozhin in his frustration with his own mediocrity.

I do believe that the our tainted souls have tainted the soil in which the Christ-seed was broken, and that our cultural imagination is probably more awash with antichrist figures than with the gospel McCoy. 666 is the return on Solomon's wisdom and glory after all...

R&M's capacity to move me I attribute to Harmon's skill as a storyteller. Rick strikes me as a John Milton's Satan character, and his pain (which the tyranny of the camera places as the most important pain, in contrast to the unfathomable harm he causes others) as the necessary, but tragic, unfolding of his basic disposition. But watching him drunkenly fail to off himself, or sitting lonely on his Toilet of Solitude, my gut wrenches. Human pains don't make you good, but they offer you a seat at the table shared experience with the rest of, with its tears, and wickedness, and theophanies all.

with Love,
your friend and brother
