08:44:46 AM [[DannyGlands]]: h0p3->what charecters are you using for the description of your network and here?
07:57:13 PM [[h0p3]]: Supposed to be: ⦗ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱: h0p3⦘
07:57:49 PM [[h0p3]]: I've had different results, depending on the linking. Sometimes it shows up correctly (no idea how to reproduce it).
07:58:52 PM [[h0p3]]: There's a couple problems I've encountered with font rendering in DarkMX (I'm not complaining one bit - I consider myself quite fortunate to be able to use this tool).

07:02:26 AM [[DannyGlands]]: i mean inthe description column and the topic column
12:16:24 PM [[h0p3]]: Oh, I see. Sorry. Well, the Network Description is "ꦌꦃꦌꦃꦽ꧀ꦸꦾꦌꦽꦽꦾ꧀ꦃꦽꦌꦽꦽꦾ꧀ꦃꦽ꧀ꦽꦽ꧀ꦽꦸꦃ꧀ꦽꦾ꧀ꦽ꧀ꦌꦽꦽꦾ꧀ꦃꦽ꧀ꦽꦽ꧀ꦽꦸꦃ꧀ꦽꦾ꧀ꦽ꧀ꦌꦃꦽ꧀ꦸꦾꦌꦃꦽ꧀ꦸꦾꦌꦽꦽꦾ꧀ꦃꦽ꧀ꦽꦽ꧀ꦽꦸꦃ꧀ꦽꦾ꧀ꦽ꧀ꦌꦃꦽ꧀ꦸꦾꦌꦃꦽ꧀ꦸꦾꦌꦽꦽꦾ꧀ꦃꦽ꧀ꦽꦽ꧀ꦽꦸꦃ꧀ꦽꦾ꧀ꦽ꧀ꦌꦃꦽ꧀ꦸꦾꦌꦃꦽ꧀ꦸꦾꦌ�
12:16:39 PM [[h0p3]]: (doesn't render correctly in this chatroom either, but it's close enough)
12:16:48 PM [[h0p3]]: I think it's pretty. That's the only reason it's there.
12:19:34 PM [[h0p3]]: I have no idea what these characters are. Hehe.
