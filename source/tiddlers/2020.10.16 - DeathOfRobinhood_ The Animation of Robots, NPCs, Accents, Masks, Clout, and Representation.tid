Hey, how was your week?
Oct 16, 2020 5:48pm
Yo!
Oct 16, 2020 5:57pm
It's been reasonably good. Insulated.
Oct 16, 2020 5:57pm
How about you?
Oct 16, 2020 5:57pm
Sky's a beautiful colour
Oct 16, 2020 6:04pm

Oct 16, 2020 6:04pm
Raining here

Oct 16, 2020 6:05pm
It is beautiful.
Oct 16, 2020 6:05pm

Makes the brick pink
Oct 16, 2020 6:05pm
We've been good. Finding ways to be in community while insulating officially
Oct 16, 2020 6:07pm
The 2020 struggle.
Oct 16, 2020 6:07pm
How's work going? And, Selah?
Oct 16, 2020 6:10pm
Work's fun. We're finally animating that robot episode
Oct 16, 2020 6:23pm
I spoke a bit with the voice actor who does our main character today
Oct 16, 2020 6:23pm
He appreciates the stories we build
Oct 16, 2020 6:24pm
He's used to primarily doing localization work. Taking American media and doing dub work in french
Oct 16, 2020 6:24pm
It's rare something gets produced locally for and by Quebecois
Oct 16, 2020 6:24pm
Although he himself is from France, and they have a lot more native output there.
Oct 16, 2020 6:25pm
It's an official cultural artifact.
Oct 16, 2020 6:25pm
How much of a difference is there between his French and yours?
Oct 16, 2020 6:26pm
I once had an American friend who learned continental French mock my accent
Oct 16, 2020 6:27pm
lmao
Oct 16, 2020 6:27pm
Our French is i guess the hillbilly equivalent
Oct 16, 2020 6:27pm
We sneak a lot of unnecessary 'r's and 'eh's into our vowels
Oct 16, 2020 6:28pm
Does your work get exported to other French speakers too? I don't know how distribution works for your art. I assume there's a ton of redtape.
Oct 16, 2020 6:30pm
Our films go worldwide, but not our TV. We don't have that cultural clout
Oct 16, 2020 6:31pm
One day, will have to torrent your archive.
Oct 16, 2020 6:35pm
How is your family doing?
Oct 16, 2020 6:35pm
Selah's been having a lot of energy lately
Oct 16, 2020 6:38pm
She's loving the progress Evan is making (her student)
Oct 16, 2020 6:38pm
Hell yeah.
Oct 16, 2020 6:38pm
She's been making a lot of phone calls
Oct 16, 2020 6:38pm
Encouraging people
Oct 16, 2020 6:39pm
I like how it energizes her. I'm jelly, lol. That's a gift.
Oct 16, 2020 6:40pm
She's a born weightbearer
Oct 16, 2020 6:40pm

Hey, yes let's chat tomorrow :)
Oct 17, 2020 1:26pm
Unless something comes up, should be free around 7!
Oct 17, 2020 1:27pm
Awesome. =)
Oct 17, 2020 1:27pm
