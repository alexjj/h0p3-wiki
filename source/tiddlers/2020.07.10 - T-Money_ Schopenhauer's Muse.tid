Solid. Set up the camp with my offspring. Gonna see how it weathers the tropical storm here.
Fri 1:53pm
That's awesome. I'm excited for yall! If you wanna bounce any ideas off me feel free.
Fri 1:54pm
Will do! =)

One thing I did with my daughter several times was walk thru the woods and look for dry fire material after a rain. Kinda silly but super important and valuable.
Fri 1:55pm
Yup.
Fri 1:55pm
Y'all gonna wait out the storm or considering trying out camping in the storm?
Fri 1:56pm
Just going to wait. I'm not in a hurry.
Fri 1:57pm
Probabaly best. I'd be terrified as a kid in a bad storm camping. Lol
Fri 1:57pm
Having an alternative emergency shelter available, thinking about what it means to be homeless in the city, the construction of it, etc. has been most important.
Fri 1:59pm
Gonna let the weather cool down and then we'll head out.
Fri 1:59pm
Gonna make it out today?
Fri 9:01pm
Naw, we'll wait until it's comfortable. Might be weeks.
Fri 9:02pm

Fri 9:03pm
I went shooting at the gun range with a coworker this morning. Took a nap. Then ordered Mexican take out. Now playing a domino game called spinners with the girls.
Fri 9:04pm
I wanted to go night fishing. But they didn't want to. Maybe tomorrow.
Fri 9:04pm
I enjoy my time on the lake in the boat. It is very primal. Especially after dark. It's dangerous and exciting all the same.
Fri 9:05pm
I appreciate feeling alive like that.
