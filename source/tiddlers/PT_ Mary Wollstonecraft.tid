* Goverment and all human relations can be simplified, explicated, and rendered transparent
* God made all thing right and the cause of all evil is man.
* Rights entail duties none could be expected to perform duties whose natural rights are not respected.
* For a truly moral society, a complete change in the nature of the relationship between man and women is required
* Women are ill-prepared for their duties as social beings and imprisoned in a web of false expectations
* Women should be educated like men, to become rational and independent beings whose sense of worth doesn't come from their appearance.
* Women should be able to support themselves and their children, and never have to marry or remarry out of financial necessity
* Women should be granted civil and political rights; they should elect representatives of their own.
