title: 2022.12.12 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Solid Depression Sleep

<<<
Woke at 1:15. Gumpination. Meditation. [[TTTOTW]]. Hugs with my sympaticon, and some dialectics too. Cleaning. A taste of candy, some water. Responding to [[474745jfjfjjgjgf]] until tango-downed. `/wave`. Found [[a curious creature|https://www.reddit.com/user/hockiklocki]] as well.

Read comments on mi amor's paper. I'm liking the postdoc TF more now. Clarinet. [[TTTOTW]]. //Falling Down// + [[MTG]] with wasabi peas. Sleep by 6:30?

Woke at 10. [[TTTOTW]].

Shopping with my sympaticon @ Aldi. Took a while to find carts. Joked with a lady who had the same trouble as she gave me hers. One feller was quite talkative with me, joking about armageddon (this was the busiest I've seen this Aldi, no doubt). Instabrothers sorta (well, for as much as we could connect, I suppose). Started snowing while we were inside, and it was packed. Serious haul that was cheap enough. Doreen the Cat Wrangler saw us from a ways away. At this point, she addresses us as, "You two." =). Told us we were going to kill her, as we always have a ton. Asked us how often we shop. Told my sympaticon she was organized, which made my sympaticon laugh until they both started laughing. Doreen has a new litter on the way. 

Snow made it so we didn't head to the party thing. SZ wasn't going to be there, so I'm glad we didn't in the end (though, of course, I remain curious).

Cheesy garlic bread with meaty sauce and root beer + //The Taking of Pelham 123// with my sympaticon. Clarinet. Fell asleep at maybe 4? 

At some point, at least for some of us, our lives simply have too much complexity, context, and commitment to find anyone to functionally speak about it with them, even if you could find someone trustworthy. It's a good thing I trust myself; that has been hard-won. And, on the bright side, I am looking forward to the possibility of a custom AI for this. Maybe at the end of my life. 

Of note, for the first time, we didn't do [[Family Time]]. I suppose things [[change]].

Woke at 12:30? Sammiches + //Falling Down// + [[TTTOTW]].

//Skintime// + //One Night in Miami// with my sympaticon (this is the third time I've tried to pick it up). 

Snow duty. Not convinced the cover is worthy when it snows. Should snow again here soon. Sweaty, and I'm glad I have two sets of gloves that fit together. Feelin' that Hank Hill privilege.

Spent the morning with mi amor. Coffee was already ready. She gave me one of her fizzy dranks, and it was pretty good. Bad news about the possibility of losing her break. I wish there was a way to select for students who would tend to be willing to cover that section. Sat and read together. Gumpination..

//One Night in Miami// + [[TTTOTW]]. A surprisingly shitty argument about [[power]] @1:25:00. Breakfast with my sympaticon, grits and eggs (root beer too), //Falling Down//, //Drive My Car//. Dadnap. Woke at 11:30?

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! Roads have cleared up some, but should snow again. [[5c0ut]] is home early. Feeling sick to the stomach. [[TTTOTW]]. Played with [[MTG]] cards and had some delicious liquids with [[1uxb0x]] and [[ASK]] for a few minutes.

Offspring came down to grind. A few words with [[Ignota]]. My daughter was not in a good mood, but that got better (especially when Ranga began snoring on her, face down into her legs). My son wanted to read, and she didn't. //Freakonomics// was a fun book (and he'll be looking for critiques). We grind.

Swear I can feel my memory fading and myself getting dumber. Perhaps it will ease the burden of what I owe to society. =D. Good news is that the house insurance already covers the solar panels.

Mi amor called. I hope she will continue to have more control over scheduling of the library itself; it is an access problem. Still worried about her grade in Greek, and making plans to study it consistently as part of her work routine. I think having the resources all compiled, updated, set to go, ready for her to employ with her users is the most important part of it. If she continues beyond, may it be a relaxing, joyous practice, like her psaltery. Dyslexia, Arial. Her promotion material only needs updating, and I'm glad that this isn't a stressful process. She doesn't have time for it to be stressful. She hit the library, and it's cute that the librarians consistently comment on the books mi amor picks out (great minds).

Thinking about draft pools with my sympaticon. Cool drank. My sympaticon has 62 of the 100 white cards, and I think she must go that direction. Splash of green and maybe black to round out the control. I don't mind taking asymmetric trades here, as I want competition and my deck is almost complete-ish.

//The Walk// with mi amor. New shoes are dope, but I now have blisters on my feet. Hrm. I needed that walk though. It is a delight to be bundled up when it's this cold. Clarinet. Lots of drivers comin' at us.

[[Family Gathering]] was pleasant. We had ham and potato au gratin, water too. //Mr. Robot// is winding down. [[TTTOTW]]. I fell asleep at 8:30?
