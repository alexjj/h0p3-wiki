title: 2022.10.28 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Blinked Away

[[Canvassing]] a bit more lately; pearls before swine, generally. [[TTTOTW]] + SC2Vod. Sleep by 2.

Woke at 5. Ugh. I'm awake. Gumpination. Hugs'n'bugs. [[TTTOTW]]. 

Glad to see Pelosi has been attacked (or close enough). I can only hope Twitter dies today. `/pray`.

Gives me some [[hope]] to see [[Impassionata]] [[wrestling]] with [[Anders Aamodt]] (who clearly has failed to recognize just how much shit we are in and why). Anders has no theory of justification (denying such a thing can obtain), and, oddly enough, I think he slips into conflating it with the memetic efficacy of Reason (a mind-boggling move). Denying the existence of truth and evil specimens in our species (while helping himself to these whenever he wants; only ideologically pure asceticism and silence when it suits him) just is part of the problem. A reminder of the spirit of that claim that a friend to everyone is a friend to no one, ofc. As far as postmodern clowns go, I adore the man; sometimes he's brilliantly compassionate, and I'd wager the maintenance of SotS is probably his best work (he seems more likely to stay where he's comfortable rather than going out into the trenches, unlike [[Impassionata]]). What have we learned today? Is it nothing? IT IS NOTHING!! IT IS!!@!@#@# =D. Never give up.

Attempted sleep. I know I got some. Fighting for it. Maybe woke at 1:30?

Offspring came down to grind. It was a quiet one. [[5c0ut]] came down to provide plans. I'm excited for them. I've only been to Boston a couple times. 

Mi amor called. 48/50 on her exam, one that many failed. She is growing more quiet in class, letting others do the talking, and she is the speaker of last resort. The topics she would be interested in talking about aren't likely to be talked about (can't say it's fair). `/squint`. I feel like I know that feel.

//Raw Skintime//. //Inform the Men!// Meditation. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Assignments.

Noodles + fizzy water + SC2Vod. My sympaticon filled pods and cut cards with me. Lots of cutting. I made cardboxes, labels, set aside 60 of each basic land, and sleeved everything up. My old shoebox of basic lands is ded. Perhaps delusionally, I will miss you, inanimate thing. Thank you. Put mi amor to bed.

Sleep by 11.
