[9:34 PM] kickscondor: this is my time to soak YOU in
[9:34 PM] kickscondor: hey so what do i do
[9:34 PM] kickscondor: i don't know this warez
[9:34 PM] kickscondor: do i join a channel or what
[9:34 PM] h0p3: Me neither. I'm still learning it.
[9:35 PM] h0p3: Yes. That link I sent is to join the family server.
[9:35 PM] kickscondor: ok lessee
[9:35 PM] h0p3: Should be able to click on it and it should enable you to join.

[9:35 PM] h0p3: ! :slight_smile:
[9:35 PM] kickscondor: ok
[9:36 PM] kickscondor: i guess this is the place
[9:36 PM] kickscondor: yeah so don't mean to storm in and command the evening
[9:37 PM] kickscondor: if there's a better time to catch up, that's cool
[9:37 PM] kickscondor: i know you got your checklists to check
[9:37 PM] h0p3's: Yeah, totally.
[9:37 PM] h0p3: Lol, I'm hanging in there.
[9:38 PM] h0p3: Surreal seeing you live. Been a while since we sat in a realtime chatroom.
[9:38 PM] h0p3: Btw, quasi-admin, in case you want to make your own channels in here.
[9:38 PM] kickscondor: yeah i have not been online much even lately - so i'm not as read up on the link logs and carpe tempests as per the usual
[9:39 PM] h0p3: I can appreciate that. I assume you are crazy busy.
[9:39 PM] h0p3: How have you been?
[9:40 PM] kickscondor: i'm good - my family's bad year was several years ago, so this year has not been difficult for us
[9:40 PM] h0p3: yes, sir
[9:40 PM] kickscondor: but hey it's rough year for folks, totally feel that
[9:41 PM] h0p3: I definitely relate to that. Been a good year internally.
[9:41 PM] kickscondor: sure, i get busy - but also try to be measured about time online - it's like any other drug
[9:41 PM] h0p3: :stuck_out_tongue:
[9:42 PM] kickscondor: damn i need to catch up on the fams wikis
[9:42 PM] h0p3: You have so much more discipline than I will ever have there.
[9:42 PM] kickscondor: your media empire hypertextual
[9:42 PM] h0p3: Our*, I hope.
[9:43 PM] kickscondor: i kind of want to cut straight to it - i'm really glad to know you and gone back and forth for the past few years
[9:43 PM] k0sh3k: Conversation I just had with Meow: "Who's a good kitty? You are! Yes, you are, Sweetie! Ow! OW! BITCH!"
[9:43 PM] kickscondor: i'm not a great online friend - i didn't mean to make any friends, because i kind of look at it more like a game
[9:44 PM] k0sh3k: Hi, Kicks!
[9:44 PM] h0p3: Yes, sir. It has been an honor and a pleasure. I am glad to be your friend no matter what game we're in.
[9:44 PM] kickscondor: but i love the people i've discover, esp this group
[9:44 PM] kickscondor: who da goat
[9:44 PM] h0p3: [[k0sh3k]] herself.
[9:44 PM] kickscondor: oh sweeeet
[9:44 PM] kickscondor: madame
[9:44 PM] k0sh3k: :smile:
[9:45 PM] kickscondor: great to meet you - damn it's overwhelming to think what to say here
[9:45 PM] h0p3: Lol. Yup. I'm an nervously giggling over here. [[k0sh3k]] is laughing too.
[9:46 PM] k0sh3k: Mostly I'm laughing because @h0p3 is actually muttering to himself as he types.
[9:46 PM] kickscondor: lol "what game we're in" - all about that
[9:46 PM] h0p3: That too!
[9:46 PM] kickscondor: the madman in a desert vibe is real
[9:46 PM] h0p3: Yes, sir. That is me. Bona fide.
[9:46 PM] k0sh3k: Beard and all.
[9:47 PM] kickscondor: i'm sorry i can't comfort you all on the political front - don't know my way around all that
[9:47 PM] kickscondor: but my heart is always with you
[9:48 PM] h0p3: Yes, sir. I appreciate that. The march continues.
[9:48 PM] kickscondor: how's your new neighborhood?
[9:48 PM] h0p3: (Btw, I was wondering if you will be doing anything with the BBS you had set up.)
[9:48 PM] kickscondor: or do you even know cause of the lockups
[9:49 PM] h0p3: It's good.
[9:49 PM] kickscondor: yeah i have a ton of plans - but i'm just too reactive
[9:49 PM] h0p3: We get to walk on the trail often, and the grocery store is very close. Walking distance.
[9:49 PM] h0p3: /salute, if and when
[9:49 PM] h0p3: We don't really know our neighbors very well, but we know some of those who walk around the area.
[9:50 PM] h0p3: How about you? How's your neck of the woods?
[9:50 PM] kickscondor: ok i just know you were pretty involved with your old neighbors, school and such
[9:50 PM] k0sh3k: Our new neighbors aren't as interested in being neighbors, lol.
[9:50 PM] k0sh3k: Maybe next set.
[9:51 PM] h0p3: Hard to do this year in some respects too.
[9:51 PM] h0p3: lockups do play a role, I assume
[9:51 PM] kickscondor: yeah i'm very into my neighbors - haven't seen as much of some of them this year, but i walk around a lot, same deal
[9:52 PM] h0p3: Have yall been staying relatively healthy this year?
[9:52 PM] kickscondor: i live in a newer development (2003 or something) and they levelled the old block before they built it
[9:52 PM] kickscondor: except for this one mailbox
[9:53 PM] kickscondor: so i have this mailbox behind my house that's got no house to go with it
[9:53 PM] kickscondor: i guess it's the mailbox for anyone who wants to mail the back of my house
[9:53 PM] kickscondor: anyway, it's the "secret mailbox" and it's kind of a feature in the area
[9:54 PM] kickscondor: our block is always reporting what comes in - cause weird mail is always showing up there
[9:54 PM] kickscondor: one of my goals is to make a plaque for it and do guided tours on saturday afternoons
[9:55 PM] h0p3: What are some standout pieces of mail you've found in the mailbox?
[9:57 PM] kickscondor: yeah no sickness here - i don't know how much you all get phantom coughs/taste tho - it's all been that kind of thing
[9:57 PM] h0p3: Cool.
[9:58 PM] kickscondor: oh like a lot of dietary supplement info - and mlm end of year reports
[9:58 PM] h0p3: I can't say phantom coughs/taste, but definitely plenty of anxiety. Walking has been pretty valuable for me on this front.
[9:59 PM] kickscondor: some of it is the names of the businesses that mail gets addressed to - i think someone started using the box before we discovered what was going on
[10:00 PM] kickscondor: dude, picturing philosopher.life walking around town - that's sick
[10:00 PM] h0p3: I do my best, sir. Lol.
[10:01 PM] h0p3: Some people have enjoyed speaking with me, and plenty know I'm just that insane person with his worry beads and overtight clothing.
[10:01 PM] kickscondor: hey have you done any other streams like the indieweb one you hit?
[10:01 PM] h0p3: Nope.
[10:01 PM] kickscondor: you had some gold there
[10:01 PM] kickscondor: yeah, save it up
[10:01 PM] h0p3: I had considered speaking with Jeremy about TW.
[10:01 PM] kickscondor: ok this is what we need to talk about
[10:02 PM] kickscondor: sometimes i'll post vids or branch out - and i start going, "what's the point - i really just want to be living in my home on therealkickscondor.com"
[10:03 PM] h0p3: I hear that, lol.
[10:03 PM] kickscondor: but then i hear you on the indieweb broadcast and i'm like, "hope needs to do this more"
[10:03 PM] kickscondor: because it's like a crystallized dropoff of condensation from your wiki
[10:04 PM] kickscondor: and like it's not at all about preaching the word of wiki
[10:04 PM] kickscondor: but it somewhat is
[10:04 PM] h0p3: That is a goal of mine. I hope to do it well.
[10:04 PM] kickscondor: and it's definitely about FTO
[10:04 PM] kickscondor: and i wonder if it's also good exercise that will benefit the wiki, friendships, who knows
[10:05 PM] h0p3: I think it does improve that.
[10:05 PM] kickscondor: at the same time, i'm torn - i like restricting myself to a single channel
[10:06 PM] kickscondor: because someone might hear you on the cast - but never actually see philosopher.life - and that's the real deal
[10:06 PM] kickscondor: so i guess i have wondered your thoughts
[10:07 PM] h0p3: My wiki is an essential primary object I use to communicate.
[10:07 PM] kickscondor: yeah i wouldn't have wanted to just meet you in a reddit thread

[10:07 PM] kickscondor: the whole experience of trying to make contact and work out our own comms was epic
[10:08 PM] h0p3: Yes, sir. Lol.
[10:09 PM] h0p3: I will keep thinking about how to inject myself into those spheres.
[10:10 PM] kickscondor: if someone asked you for an interview with a podcast - maybe they have - would you do it?
[10:11 PM] k0sh3k: Well, Kokonut is sending me to bed, I guess, so I'll talk to you both later. :slight_smile:
[10:11 PM] kickscondor: nite k0sh3k - take care
[10:11 PM] k0sh3k: You, too!
[10:12 PM] h0p3: I'd like to know more about my interviewer first.
[10:14 PM] kickscondor: well, they're a reader of philosopher.life - would you want to expound on the topic?
[10:14 PM] kickscondor: or would you rather that the wiki stand on its own?
[10:15 PM] h0p3: I would like for the wiki to stand on its own. It can't. I agree that I have to expound on it, and not just with it and in it.
[10:15 PM] kickscondor: (btw hi @chameleon hi @Sphygmus - in case i'm not around, i still want to say hi at least)
[10:16 PM] kickscondor: Oh cool answer.
[10:16 PM] kickscondor: I mean you expound on the wiki from inside the wiki.
[10:16 PM] kickscondor: this happens quite a lot :slight_smile:
[10:16 PM] h0p3: Yes, sir, lol.
[10:17 PM] kickscondor: I'm guilty of this, of course. Even though the metadiscussion is shameful - someone has to have it. :smile:
[10:18 PM] h0p3: Yes. That is a crucial point. I realize it's not a topic that's simple or that ever ends.
[10:18 PM] kickscondor: one thing i wish i would have tackled in ht2020 was: what are the key skills in PSM
[10:18 PM] kickscondor: or just wiki writing in general
[10:19 PM] h0p3: I don't have an answer that is satisfactory enough.
[10:19 PM] kickscondor: yeah exactly!
[10:19 PM] h0p3: Lol. :slight_smile:
[10:19 PM] kickscondor: but it was a question that i skipped over
[10:20 PM] kickscondor: i just kind of went right to: what's the future of PSM
[10:20 PM] h0p3: Gotta have both.
[10:20 PM] kickscondor: but i think you have to ask about the human features of PSM
[10:20 PM] kickscondor: like what does/could it entail?
[10:21 PM] kickscondor: and what would the discipline look like - like, say, if it were a series of classes
[10:21 PM] kickscondor: what would the syllabus be
[10:21 PM] h0p3: That may be something I should do.
[10:21 PM] kickscondor: i mean that's kind of a vapid question - but if you look at it as a mental exercise, it's a good start maybe
[10:22 PM] h0p3: I do have plenty of thoughts on the matter.
[10:22 PM] kickscondor: i absolutely think you should
[10:22 PM] kickscondor: but i didn't come here to simply give you things to do :slight_smile:
[10:22 PM] kickscondor: i mean "i would dig that"
[10:23 PM] kickscondor: i really apologize for how sloppy i am
[10:23 PM] h0p3: In many respects, I can only explain how to do it the poor way I know how to do it (and I've done a non-trivial job of trying to explain that).
[10:23 PM] kickscondor: this is part of my anxiety in chatting - i don't want to grind the discussion to a halt with my poor off-the-cuff phrasings
[10:23 PM] h0p3: I need to condense it, clean it up, make it fit for a broad set of people.
[10:23 PM] h0p3: You won't. You may change the topic to anything you want. You have my attention.
[10:24 PM] kickscondor: or you could describe how you do it, perhaps even your family
[10:24 PM] kickscondor: and that could be huge
[10:24 PM] h0p3: I do wish to have something that can be simply replicated.
[10:24 PM] kickscondor: i mean you write about this already - so yeah i supposed generalizing it needs to be done
[10:25 PM] chameleon: Heya kicks!
[10:25 PM] chameleon: Hope you're well
[10:25 PM] kickscondor: oh god, my knees are weak
[10:25 PM] kickscondor: chame - chame chame
[10:26 PM] chameleon: :chameleon:
[10:26 PM] kickscondor: adorable
[10:26 PM] kickscondor: hows the waifu haus
[10:27 PM] kickscondor: i wish there was a waifu haus in every neighborhood
[10:27 PM] kickscondor: for sunday afternoon social gatherings
[10:27 PM] chameleon: Hehehe, it's chugging along. I restarted daily tasks after a short hiatus
[10:28 PM] kickscondor: oh i'm sorry - i don't mean the wiki, i follow you of course
[10:28 PM] kickscondor: i was speaking of the waifu haus in more general terms - as a kind of place/state of mind
[10:28 PM] kickscondor: like the realm of vishnu or some such
[10:29 PM] chameleon: Oh! Haha. Well, metaphysically speaking - good
[10:29 PM] kickscondor: i also don't mean to put you on the spot
[10:29 PM] kickscondor: it's really good to see you - to see your ascii characters
[10:30 PM] kickscondor: i was asking hope if he would go on a podcast and explain philosopher.life
[10:30 PM] chameleon: I would listen to that :)
[10:30 PM] kickscondor: and he said yes - and now where are we
[10:30 PM] h0p3: (Would you think it stupid to have a template TW, or do you think the goal should be to explain a process that can be replicated on paper alone?)
[10:31 PM] kickscondor: oh yeah i also said he should make a class for us to take
[10:31 PM] chameleon: Hrmm
[10:31 PM] kickscondor: so i'm in senpai worship mode
[10:31 PM] kickscondor: hey i liked the album you posted the other day
[10:32 PM] kickscondor: i got interrupted part way through but
[10:32 PM] kickscondor: panic division
[10:32 PM] kickscondor: i'm such a fucking link cowboy, apologies
[10:32 PM] kickscondor: i must exude this image of a dude smoking in a back room with a ball cap
[10:33 PM] kickscondor: in front of a wall of screens
[10:33 PM] kickscondor: it's mostly true
[10:34 PM] kickscondor: re: template tw - sure why not?
[10:34 PM] kickscondor: i mean having to write out installation guidelines is lame i guess
[10:35 PM] kickscondor: but people also seem to like having some technical things to do
[10:35 PM] h0p3: Yeah. There are limits. I think the user has to take up some tech responsibilities. Not sure how to draw the line well enough.
[10:35 PM] kickscondor: the paper thing reminds me of lion kimbro
[10:35 PM] kickscondor: rawr
[10:35 PM] h0p3: Lol!
[10:35 PM] h0p3: Yes, it does.
[10:36 PM] kickscondor: remember that time you cold called lion kimbro?
[10:36 PM] kickscondor: AHAHHAHAA
[10:36 PM] h0p3: I should speak with him again sometime, lol.
[10:36 PM] kickscondor: i am so fond of you
[10:36 PM] h0p3: Your madman, sir.
[10:36 PM] kickscondor: don't forget it!
[10:36 PM] h0p3: But, dude, I think he might still be onto something.
[10:36 PM] kickscondor: so well-mannered for a dust devil
[10:37 PM] kickscondor: yeah he was
[10:37 PM] chameleon: Which panic division album, kicks? :3
[10:37 PM] kickscondor: yeah uh didn't you recommend one - lets see
[10:38 PM] kickscondor: touch
[10:42 PM] kickscondor: my sister works at a target
[10:42 PM] kickscondor: and she just sent me a message that a guy is yelling over the loudspeaker "fuck trump"
[10:42 PM] h0p3: Lol.
[10:42 PM] h0p3: Employee or a rando?
[10:43 PM] kickscondor: rand-o
[10:43 PM] kickscondor: would love to be there
[10:43 PM] kickscondor: i guess the cops were there too
[10:43 PM] h0p3: Lawd.
[10:43 PM] kickscondor: i hope they can't find him
[10:43 PM] h0p3: I hope they can't find him either, lol.
[10:43 PM] kickscondor: like they're just scrambling from aisle to aisle
[10:43 PM] h0p3: May he blend right in.
[10:44 PM] kickscondor: if he's in red and beige he will
[10:44 PM] h0p3: That is the video series I want to see.
[10:45 PM] h0p3: Instead of hunting for Mountain Dew, hunting for opportunities to engineer the ability to say "fuck trump" in as many stores as possible.
[10:45 PM] kickscondor: you can hunt for mountain dew as well why not
[10:45 PM] kickscondor: thank you for not abbreviating btw
[10:45 PM] h0p3: True. Two birds. Why not both?
[10:47 PM] h0p3: I find many people are annoyed when I do that. Lol.
[10:47 PM] kickscondor: i guess why not both is a meme - aka a cliche
[10:47 PM] kickscondor: but i agree - would be a great series
[10:48 PM] chameleon: Porque no los dos?
[10:48 PM] kickscondor: je ne comprende pas
[10:49 PM] chameleon: Porque - why
No - not
Los dos - both
[10:49 PM] kickscondor: oh ty ty
[10:50 PM] chameleon: From the commercial with the girl
[10:50 PM] kickscondor: haha oh wow
[10:50 PM] kickscondor: yeah my knowledge of that meme was in mere passing
[10:51 PM] kickscondor: old el paso
[10:51 PM] kickscondor: my grandma used to love the pace picante commercials
[10:51 PM] kickscondor: "new york city?"
[10:51 PM] kickscondor: and she would say "get a rope"
[10:51 PM] chameleon: Haha oh wow is another one. Tintin!
[10:51 PM] h0p3: We often say that when we see the sign. We pass by a highway often enough that points to it.
[10:52 PM] chameleon: https://youtu.be/Et3jkffS9mo
[10:53 PM] kickscondor: ok chame is giving classes now
[10:53 PM] kickscondor: this is a proper ed
[10:54 PM] kickscondor: can you all please let me know if i'm riddling chat with faux pas?
[10:54 PM] kickscondor: hahah tintin is amazing in that
[10:54 PM] h0p3: I will be sure to tell you every mistake. Hehe.
[10:55 PM] kickscondor: bless you
[10:55 PM] kickscondor: reminds me of sealab 2021
[11:03 PM] kickscondor: so wait is deathofrobinhood on here?
[11:04 PM] h0p3: Trying to get him on. May be. I don't think he cares for Discord.
[11:04 PM] h0p3: I can appreciate that.
[11:04 PM] h0p3: Hard to find a platform that everyone enjoys using.
[11:05 PM] h0p3: As you know.
[11:05 PM] h0p3: He's been joining us on Sunday evenings over Signal.
[11:05 PM] kickscondor: ok, that's cool
[11:05 PM] h0p3: If and when you have the time and inclination, you should consider joining us. I try to leave the mic on during the evening.
[11:06 PM] kickscondor: he's a reddit person right
[11:06 PM] h0p3: Yes. That is where I first met him.
[11:07 PM] h0p3: How do you meet most folks?
[11:07 PM] h0p3: You meet a very wide variety.
[11:07 PM] kickscondor: surfing
[11:07 PM] h0p3: That would make sense.
[11:08 PM] h0p3: That's not something I know how to teach well enough, not even to myself. I spend a lot of time doing it, but I'm never effective enough at it.
[11:08 PM] kickscondor: like i will go to a blog and click on every link in its sidebar
[11:08 PM] h0p3: Yes.
[11:08 PM] h0p3: I see that.
[11:08 PM] kickscondor: or go to neocities and read the entire directory
[11:08 PM] h0p3: Hence the tools and art you make.
[11:08 PM] kickscondor: which is a lot easier to do now than geocities would have been
[11:09 PM] kickscondor: yeah i think, to some extent, i try to do things that will appeal to a certain crowd
[11:09 PM] h0p3: I have no idea who your crowd is, btw. I like that.
[11:10 PM] kickscondor: like my stunts fail pretty hard, so it's not like i find many people that way
[11:10 PM] h0p3: ...
[11:10 PM] h0p3: Cmon. I don't think they are failures.
[11:10 PM] kickscondor: but i think one day i might get something to work
[11:10 PM] kickscondor: this isn't a self pity thing
[11:10 PM] kickscondor: but i tend to frustrate people
[11:10 PM] kickscondor: and i totally get that
[11:11 PM] kickscondor: like that's just how experiments are going to go
[11:11 PM] h0p3: I relate to that.
[11:11 PM] kickscondor: i still have a lot to learn about collaborating in this way
[11:12 PM] kickscondor: yeah you know more than anyone maybe
[11:12 PM] kickscondor: because i don't really want to follow the old way of just blogging and trying to find some audience or something
[11:12 PM] kickscondor: somehow i just want to be part of a landscape - like we did with hypertext 2020
[11:13 PM] kickscondor: but yeah - i don't know who the crowd is - that's kind of the point
[11:13 PM] kickscondor: who shows up - and i have to be kind of reactive about it
[11:14 PM] kickscondor: i will say that during the summer i was playing with making the website more of a layered thing
[11:14 PM] kickscondor: so that there's like an fbi layer, a hijaaked domain layer, a jb films layer
[11:15 PM] h0p3: It's dope. I spent a lot of time thinking (though I don't know what to say) about the BBS in particular.
[11:15 PM] kickscondor: and i still wonder if i can somehow do a website in that style but in a way that hits
[11:15 PM] h0p3: It hit me just fine. I don't know what you aim for well enough, but I am listening.
[11:16 PM] h0p3: I may not understand well enough the piece of H2020 art you made. If I understand correctly, one thing it points out is how each human picks out the references in piecing their own interpretation together. You link the text together by hand.
[11:16 PM] kickscondor: yeah you're amazing - i feel like you try your damnedest to understand
[11:16 PM] kickscondor: but like i don't really understand what i'm doing
[11:16 PM] kickscondor: it's all instinctual random whatever
[11:17 PM] h0p3: I don't understand what I'm doing well enough either, and you very easily understand that. You've boiled me down before to "Why are we here?" ...fuck yeah, it's practically the only thing I'm really saying half the time.
[11:17 PM] kickscondor: i wish i could have achieveed what i wanted on HT2020 - it took me forever
[11:17 PM] kickscondor: i wanted a feeling of a branched, deeply nested hypertext - but not a tiddlywiki
[11:17 PM] h0p3: I could see that becoming something in VR to explore.
[11:17 PM] kickscondor: yeah maybe so!
[11:18 PM] kickscondor: hahah wow great comment
[11:20 PM] h0p3: Reminds me of this game my great aunt played. IIRC (I realize the idpol connotations, please ignore them), she would pick out random digital images of snowflakes falling on her screen, and people had built these snowflakes (maybe?) and embedded messages on them. See that with the "this message will be deleted" site in a way. But, I like that in the flurry of snowflakes connected together, there's maybe something visually beautiful to wander.
[11:20 PM] kickscondor: that's trippy
[11:20 PM] kickscondor: it was a web page
[11:20 PM] h0p3: I don't recall.
[11:21 PM] kickscondor: or a flash game or somethingg?
[11:21 PM] h0p3: I was young at the time.
[11:21 PM] kickscondor: right right
[11:21 PM] kickscondor: baby hope
[11:21 PM] h0p3: Little did he know he would turn out to be such a prolific loser, lol.
[11:22 PM] kickscondor: to be a loser, but prolific - that's a true accomplishment
[11:22 PM] h0p3: Anyway, maybe the HT2020 images have something like that going on. It's very visual hypertext. Reminds me of other pages you've had just for your own thoughts too.
[11:22 PM] kickscondor: i'm a college dropout - slacker mentality all the way, i'm afraid
[11:23 PM] h0p3: I relate to that too.
[11:23 PM] kickscondor: part of the thing was to continue the thing sphygmus and i played with getting people quoted in their colors and fonts
[11:24 PM] kickscondor: like - what does it look like to do up a group chat like that
[11:24 PM] h0p3: Yes. You kept the flavor and personality of each person intact. You did everyone justice there.
[11:24 PM] kickscondor: and i actually connected with this writer/hacker weiwei hsu last week
[11:24 PM] kickscondor: and we did this crazy live chat where we drew on this kind of google doc together
[11:25 PM] kickscondor: so a project is going to come out of that which is kind of along the same lines
[11:26 PM] kickscondor: i also want to try live streaming the chat style we did - i don't think it would work, but it was kind of a cool hypertext way of doing a live stream
[11:26 PM] kickscondor: like we were scrolling all around and adding shit/text/images to this doc
[11:26 PM] h0p3: Also, I was wondering about the images that scrolled on the screen. They looked like unique text characters I hadn't encountered.
[11:27 PM] kickscondor: images?
[11:27 PM] h0p3: If I'm recalling correctly, yeah, like a border of alien text.
[11:27 PM] kickscondor: ohh there's like a fade on the edges of the screen
[11:28 PM] 5c0ut: Hey hey!
[11:28 PM] h0p3: My memory is probably failing me. =/.
[11:28 PM] h0p3: This is my brother, [[AIR]].
[11:28 PM] kickscondor: yeah i kind of wanted to do it so that boxes would zoom in and out
[11:28 PM] kickscondor: but i kind of had to just call it done
[11:29 PM] kickscondor: i might revisit it again - maybe we should try another at some point
[11:29 PM] 5c0ut: https://media.tenor.com/images/d38767bea06936e854b7190269138851/tenor.gif
[11:29 PM] kickscondor: hey yeah brother scout
[11:30 PM] kickscondor: can't imagine having a bro with his whole life on philosopher.life
[11:30 PM] 5c0ut: Lol. It takes a bit to get used too.
[11:31 PM] kickscondor: one of the first things i read on philo.life was h0p3's letter to your folks
[11:31 PM] kickscondor: and i was like holy shit this is an insane level wiki
[11:32 PM] kickscondor: but then i settled in and i was like holy shit yeah this IS an insane level wiki
[11:32 PM] 5c0ut: A lot of thought and love went into the his words.
[11:32 PM] kickscondor: anyway, not to be all wiki about everything
[11:32 PM] kickscondor: hope you're night's going well anon brother
[11:32 PM] 5c0ut: Lol
[11:32 PM] h0p3: How is your night going, btw?

[11:34 PM] 5c0ut: It's going ok. Sleeping when my body will let me.
[11:34 PM] h0p3: How's your heart feeling?
[11:35 PM] kickscondor: reading the brothers karamazov like crazy - good shit
[11:35 PM] kickscondor: you mostly read nonfiction right h0p3
[11:35 PM] 5c0ut: I have more scans and some blood work I have to do.
[11:36 PM] 5c0ut: But I'm not in pain right now feel like the flutter of it but not a full cycle of the palpitation
[11:36 PM] 5c0ut: I do believe that stress is causing a portion of it. Just waiting for the Dr to agree with me haha
[11:37 PM] h0p3: Yes, sir. I hope it can be found quickly.
[11:38 PM] h0p3: I hope to read more period. Not been happening lately. Been a long time since I've encountered that book.

[11:51 PM] kickscondor: but you write about it so eloquently and i get so captivated following it

[11:54 PM] Sphygmus: i mean, you know - the writing for me comes and goes, but well, i can't escape it
[11:54 PM] Sphygmus: i've been doing it too long :laughter:
[11:54 PM] h0p3: An obsession
[11:54 PM] kickscondor: yeah i think kurt vonnegut said there was bangers and swoopers or something like that
[11:54 PM] kickscondor: and the bangers just write everday like clockwork
[11:55 PM] kickscondor: and the swoopers just go in big bursts
[11:55 PM] kickscondor: and you seem like that sfig
