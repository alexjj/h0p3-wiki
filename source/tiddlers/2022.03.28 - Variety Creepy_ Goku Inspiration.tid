title: 2022.03.28 - Variety Creepy: Goku Inspiration

"""
[13:30:18] [[Variety Creepy]]: Goku
[13:30:28] [[Variety Creepy]]: Goku is so... awesome
[08:02:59] [[h0p3]]: =)
[08:03:24] [[h0p3]]: What do you like most about Goku? What's salient about him?
[15:02:25] [[Variety Creepy]]: He's the person I want to be.
[15:02:51] [[Variety Creepy]]: Not that I want to become a fighting machine, but character-wise.
[15:02:53] [[Variety Creepy]]: He's kind.
[15:02:58] [[Variety Creepy]]: Sees the good in people
[15:03:05] [[Variety Creepy]]: He's naiive.
[15:03:17] [[Variety Creepy]]: Always smiling.
[15:03:24] [[Variety Creepy]]: Ready for new challenges.
[15:03:49] [[Variety Creepy]]: A good dad, although some may claim otherwise.
[15:03:59] [[Variety Creepy]]: He's intelligent when he needs to be.
[15:04:45] [[Variety Creepy]]: And the best of all and the thing I like the most is the fact that he's merciful.
[15:17:49] [[Variety Creepy]]: "And yet, you show mercy to everyone, even your fiercest enemies, even me! Yet you never fought to kill or for revenge, only to test your limits and push yourself beyond to become the strongest you could possibly be. How can a Saiyan fight like that and at the same time, be so gentle that he wouldn't hurt a fly? Oh it makes me angry just thinking about it. But, perhaps it is my anger that's made me blind to the truth for so long. But I see it now
[15:18:29] [[Variety Creepy]]: This day has made it all too clear. You're better than me, Kakarot. You are the best."
[15:18:35] [[Variety Creepy]]: - Vegeta.
[15:18:47] [[Variety Creepy]]: And that's why, Goku is the best.
