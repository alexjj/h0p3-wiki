title: 2020.06.30 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Doubting Whether Objective Reality Presupposes An Observer

* Woke at 10
** Ugh.
* Plumber arrived.
** Appears to have fixed it. I was clear that I was not sure, but he seemed convinced of my reasoning (cool). 
** He did not fix the lamp.
* Could not fall back asleep.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Dialectures
* Walk+Talk
* More "I'm a fucking idiot" territory.
** Sit down, my children, and let me try to tell you once again to never trust your browser storage. Your ol' man is a fool (and will surely be a fool many times again). I should remember that my extensions are fleeting conveniences.
** Backups saved my ass again. `/kiss` (I love you, [[m16]]).
** Grep found 'wrastle' in the binary files holding onto my trapped data. Unfortunately, no super clean conversion available yet. Will hunt around.
* Read+Write
* Talked with [[JRE]]:
** The solar option is insanely expensive. I'm grateful he looked into it. 
** Prefers Google Docs. Breaks my heart.
** Has a HDD dying on him. He JBODs, and says he doesn't really care about his files.
** He has to upgrade to Win10 to use his Oculus. 
*** Having trouble with his USB card still.
*** Recommended NVME.
**** He's considering buying a new computer, but I think it makes way more sense to try to use what he has. 
*** Recommended Loonix ageen. 
* Walk+Talk
* Fireman Time!
* Read+Write
* Dialectures
** [[Lojban]] and our attempts at learning natural languages
* Walked with wife
** June claims to have seen our son riding a bike (multiple times). She doesn't know what my son looks like.
*** She's taking a bike out for a spin. She's often out at the same time we are.
*** Talked librarian shop with my wife (since she works at another college here)...what are the odds?
**** 4% spy prediction now.
***** For the record, "Mature Asian" is an extremely common Google Search of mine. XD.
** She took me on a long path, scoping more spots out too.
** Grabbed her coffee beans.
*** She points to the woman's ass for me. Yum. 
**** Unfortunately, a pig walked in, and that ruins the atmosphere.
* Fireman Time!
** 2-3 times a day is completely normal.
* Wife and I made dinner
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Tendies, veggie and fruit platter, cherries
*** Our cucumbers were frozen and became goo. =(. Fuck, I hate wasting food.
** //Dominion//. Very close game. I'm going to start losing to folks here soon.

* [[TW Canvassing]]
* Walk+Talk
** My rattlesnake beads are made of bone, and they are changing coloration due to how much I handle them. Not sure how to describe it. It's pretty though.
