I am surprised to hear from you, stranger.<<ref "i">> I'm blessed to meet kind folks in the world. Usually, I am the one who must go out into the world to find [[others]], but you found me. Also, please let me if I can be of any [[help]]. 

<<<
h0p3,

Just a quick note to say I've spent the entirety of my day off reading your wiki. I don't usually message strangers out of the blue but I was compelled to congratulate you.
<<<

Thank you for taking the time to read my little corner of the interwebs. It's cool that sliding into DMs still bears fruit. I [[hope]] to engage in that practice of reaching out more. I send some notes here and there with [[FTO: Ping]], but I've plenty to learn about messaging strangers out of the blue. I'm honored that you feel compelled to congratulate me. I don't feel like I've accomplished my tasks yet (if I ever satisfactorily will), so it's nice to hear encouragement.

Love your brand of humour. Your writings to your wife were beautiful and the fart smeltings had me creasing up. Very creative, very well organised. Love it. The blend of philosophy, musings, and linguistics are right up my alley. Very impressed. The whole thing looks fantastic â€“ what an effort, brother.
<<<

That is high praise. Thank you. Most people do not have the reactions, sensibilities, or impressions you do about this wiki.

Even though I do not really know what it is well enough, it has been quite a bit of work. I am lucky to have the chance to read and think about the lives of others. I wouldn't have a wiki if I didn't have people I cared about.

<<<
I find myself wondering what you know now that you wish you had known when you started off?
<<<

All of it. Everything I know now (which includes knowledge-pointers to things I've known before or must search/jog to remember). 

There's not a clean answer beyond that, especially because [[the process of acquiring|2019.12.03 - Prompted Introspection: Better Than School]] what little knowledge I have is part of the real transformation. The act of writing it down does something extra; there is often a space where I have to ask myself who I am going to be. I'm open to calling this //Process Theology//, even as an agnostic or deist.<<ref "th">>

I take it you want something specific, and perhaps something that pertains immediately to your context. I don't know how much quick help I can be to you. This question reminds me of my inability to effectively answer many of [[dziggetai]]'s excellent questions. I'm gonna have to sound like a caveman here. You will have to decide what is retarded, obvious, mean, or useless to you.

* This tool is way more special than it looks. Try harder.
* The world is as evil as I feared.
** But, what is good in the world is real AF!
* Skin in the game is fundamental to my deepest relationships.
** One can defect on obligated risk, and that must be accounted for wisely (especially in principal-agent problems).
** Both my ingrouping and outgrouping are expensive processes, and they should be.
*** I must [[Straussian]]ly interpret each person in two ways: as though they are evil, and as though they are good. The answer is somewhere in between.
* I'm far more lucky to be alive than I knew.
** I also have stronger reasons to live, to fight, to forgive, and to do my best.
* The wiki does not appear to become less expensive to read+write, but the aspects of what is difficult varies over time.
** The learning curve does not get easier.
* Don't be afraid to make your life and wiki messy, gunky, and reconstructed, as it's necessary.
* Talk to yourself, [[/b/]]ishly. No one else can hear you as well as you do.
** Recognize that most people who claim to care about your thoughts and feelings don't actually.

If your question is how I would do things differently, we border on various kinds of wish questions. I ask you to be extremely specific with me then. I hate to be such a pedantic interpreter here, and I will search for a way to articulate the question you intend.

<<<
I've been poking and prodding at different knowledge base software/methods for over a year. I've been unwilling to commit to any given platform but stumbling across the Tiddlywiki Telegram and finding your wiki amongst the chat has convinced me to go in that direction.
<<<

Cool. I'm glad. I hope a ton of people start using Tiddlywiki. There's nothing else quite like it at the end of the day.

I have long treated Tiddlywiki as a convenient wrapper for just a bunch of text files linked together; it saves me from having to piece together a bunch of random scripts and tools together in some cases (and, I doubt I would be as clever as the TW community). I can still escape from this device into another if I need, but I would suffer some losses to do that now. I've not found a suitable replacement, but I still suspect that a minmax poweruser who didn't aim to create a public document would still be best served by living in the commandline. Presumably, emacs reins supreme. To my eyes, you should limit the fancy things you try to build, and instead just write plain markup files. Committing to actually writing something worthwhile is the real leap. Just write.

<<<
No pressure to respond. If nothing else, I hope this serves to give you a little boost today, or tomorrow, or whenever you read it. A little recognition from a stranger goes a long way sometimes.

Keep on trucking. All the love from rainy Melbourne.

Aye, aye, cap'n. `/salute`

Sincerely,
