[[TTTOTW]]. Hit up a bunch of Soulseek channels. Dropping one relevant link per. Unfun but my job to speak with Aryan Brotherhood, Racist Russian channels, and other psychopaths. I'm supposed to take the heat though. //Skintime// with my sympaticon + //Community//. Sleep by 1:30?

Woke at 6. Needed to take a push, but nothing came out. Ruh-roh. That is unlike me. Mi amor was glad. Kisses. Back to sleep.

Woke at 10? Meditation. //Skintime// with my sympaticon. [[Morning Routine]]. Planning. [[TTTOTW]] with tea. [[Variety Creepy]] hi-tag.

Finishing my token conversation with [[correancollar]]. Fishing turned up some psychopathic [[anon]]s, some Russians-writers, and a wild [[dvrk]] appears...`/wave`

Shopping @ Aldi with my sympaticon. Prices are going up (workers were talking about the prices as they were changing them too, and I joined 'em), yet our total expenditure has been going down (though our pantry has dwindled some*). [[ASK]] is the reason we succeed here. We are [[lucky]].

Shopping @ W-Entity with my sympaticon. Some remaining supplies for the [[garden]] has been acquired. We grabbed some missing food supplies too. 

[[TTTOTW]].

Dialectics with my daughter. Quite a struggle, but ended in plans and XOXOs. I agree with several of her conclusions. We're both more [[hope]]ful.

Prepared dinner with my sympaticon. Not much for me to do besides the potatoes. [[JRE]] called. He's struggling to get anyone to even try to understand what their union is for (and the nature of [[justice]]). Even Aaron is revealing himself to be exploitative. Brother talked to a feller near the top of the foodchain about the union contract problem. He's setting up contacts outside of the infrastructure owned by the company to run the union (and finding out, yet again, just how horrifyingly far the disorganization and indifference goes). I'm looking for resources for him, and I suggested that he works to own the means of production in their communication (a FB group can be shutdown for many reasons out the blue, and decentralizing control of the core data is worthy).<<ref "fb">> 

[[TTTOTW]]. Compiling and going to be asking around for [[JRE]]. Sir Brother [[DeathOfRobinhood]]'s suggestion comes to mind yet again. But, I suggest that my brother [[JRE]] would be the most fitting person for a variety of reasons. Brainstorming and writing for him would be my honor; my brother is a significantly better speaker than I am, he knows his audience, and they know him. Tiktok account with multiple distribution methods, perhaps. 1-3 minute rundowns, crisp rehearsals and well-marshalled arguments, [[antipleonasm]]s.

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. //Inform the Men!// Shower of the gods!

[[Family Gathering]] was outstanding. //The Big Short// for a few minutes. [[k0sh3k]] joined, and we switched to the Crucifixion episode of //House//. [[TTTOTW]]. Vapelyfe.

Funneled CBD/MCT solution into droppers. Labels. 5 drops is puh-lenty, and I've only touched the first 25% of our powder. 4k hits for 80 bucks, parts included.

[[Canvassing]]. Been a while since I did this, maybe for [[kicks]] when fraidyc.at was in alpha. A wild Sunnybunnypop appears...
