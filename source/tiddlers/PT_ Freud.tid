; 1856-1939: Sigmund Freud

* There is a dynamic unconscious part of the mind which exerts pressures on influences on what we do and say.
* The 'unconscious' is different from the 'preconscious' (some memories, facts, etc) which can become conscious.
* The human mind has three structural systems: the 'id' (instincts), the 'ego' (the reconcile), and the 'super-ego'(consience)
* All the energy in our minds comes from the instincts alone
* The 'Life' instinct (Eros) contains erotic and self-preservative instincts; the 'Death' instinct (Thanatos) contains sadism, aggression, self-harm, etc.
* The Little boy has a desire for his mother and a fear of castration by his father (Oedipus complex); the little girl developes penis envy.
* When we repress our inner conflicts, they continue to exist in the unconscious and create neurotic symptoms.
* Neurosis can sometimes be treated with psychoanalysis: a process that brings back the repressed material into consciousness
* Our whole civilized life might be neurotic because of the sacrifice of instinctual satisfaction
* The teaching of religion are illusions just as they are unverifiable, they are also irrefutable.
* Tuse private judgement about religious arguments would be a wanton undertaking; such questions are too significant for that,
* The God that many philosopher define is no more than an insubstantial shadow, no longer the mighty figure of religious teaching.
* The truths contained in religion are so distorted and symbolically disguised that most people are incapable of recognizing them as truth.
* Our mental apparatus was in fact developed in the effort to map the outside world, so must have a certain amount of expediency in its structure
