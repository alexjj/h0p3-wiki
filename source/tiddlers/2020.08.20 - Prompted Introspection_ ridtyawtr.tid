!! What do you think the world needs now?

This question borders on being absurd, and I have only a sliver of an impact on it. It's still my duty to at least conceive of some answers. Normally, I would answer with [[Justice]], radically stripping the wealthy of their [[power]], [[Socialism]], or moral education. Bada-bing, nailed it, right? I should have more to say than that. It's unfortunate how many of the other answers and smaller things rely upon the bigger answers I'd give, and I also think the question is interesting assuming that my bigger answers would not obtain (though I will not accept false compromises). 

[[Hope]], a belief that their lives objectively matter, that their actions do have consequences (the necessity of violence), that it's possible for the [[good]] ones to win non-trivially, that sacrifice isn't in vain, that most of the metanarratives at the buffet are garbage, but not all. It's not my prediction, of course. [[ridtyawtr]], I wish they understood that claim.

Alright, enough with the heart-wrenching truth. One man could make a huge dent: third-party Bernie. He might actually win. He won't. I have very mixed feelings about that, sir.
