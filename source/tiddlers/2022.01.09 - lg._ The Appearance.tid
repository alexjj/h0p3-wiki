"""
[16:06:30] lg.: Hi.
[16:06:39] h0p3: Hello!
[16:07:02] h0p3: It's not common that I connect with folks on Tox these days. 
[16:07:23] lg.: What other chat client do you prefer?
[16:07:27] h0p3: (though tox is by far my preferred client)
[16:07:40] h0p3: I just meant that it is rare that anyone uses it with me. I'm delighted.
[16:10:16] h0p3: I have [[Family Time]] in a few minutes. I //do// respond to all my messages, and I try to be timely about it. 
[16:11:04] h0p3: I assume we've not met before. It's an honor to meet you. I [[hope]] to learn more about you. Usually, it's pretty asymmetrical (since I write far too much).
[16:12:44] lg.: Thank you. It's a very useful assumption.
[16:14:09] lg.: Why do you need to meet the others? Is your purpose easy to put into words?
[16:16:39] h0p3: My {[[Axioms]]} are a rough sketch of my purpose (or the means to them), though the contents of them are fleshed out in the body of the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 more generally. I do not consider it easy to reason about, and I struggle to put it into words as well.
[16:17:05] h0p3: I consider [[Find The Others]] to be a moral obligation.
[16:18:45] h0p3: Meeting likely comes in [[degrees or kinds|dok]]. I do meet with some [[offline|Offline Users]], though that is exceedingly rare.
[16:20:24] h0p3: I'm [[grateful]] that you pick out those in your [[questions|Question Everything]]. 
[16:20:51] h0p3: What do you think and feel about your own purpose(s) and meeting [[others]]?
[16:22:04] h0p3: I have to AFK now. [[My wife]] has work tomorrow, and it usually takes about 5 hours to complete family time (I want to make sure she gets to bed at a reasonable hour). 
[16:22:40] lg.: I am available again in 12 hours.
[16:22:59] h0p3: `/salute`
[21:45:09] lg.: Unfortunately, I will be approximately two hours late.
[21:45:42] h0p3: Take your time, homie. We'll talk when we can. Asynchronous communications is fine with me.
