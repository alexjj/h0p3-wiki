title: 2021.10.20 - Prompted Introspection: We Live In A Society

!! How do society's morals differ from your own?

I'm not a fan of how this question is phrased, as it often implies and promotes an ambiguity too many embrace. You mean to talk about moral beliefs (beliefs about morals, not morals themselves), desires, or other mental states.<<ref "i">> 

I'm not a moral anti-realist, and so that is where I would begin in slicing through many of the beliefs of the societies with which I differ on this topic. The Moral Law is real, universal, immutable, unconditional, and accessibly obtains external to our minds (thus, it is also in some non-trivial respects the same for everyone, hence my concern with the ambiguity); that is a belief cluster not many hold well if at all, [[WINTCIS]]. Obviously, metaethical beliefs are fundamental moral beliefs (hence why this point counts). Most people I encounter fail the test with me, and I'm not talking about the ability to articulate the issue (and, lord knows, I'm a radical failure here too). I'm including tacit moral knowledge, intuitions, judgments, dispositions, and most importantly, intentions, as well.<<ref "s">> I think the Rand-Locke memeplex, hyperindividualism, mere skepticism, subjectivism (including, ironically, "Objectivism"), egoism, and postmodern normativity conditions<<ref "sk">> have permeated most '[[civil]]' (and I mean this with every ounce of contempt I can muster) societies non-trivially (as Sir Nietzsche predicted and failed to address, ultimately), and I think these are often poorly understood and wrestled with by most people I encounter.<<ref "e">> Furthermore, we do not morally own ourselves all the way down, and that is often where I diverge even from those who would claim to be moral realists themselves.

I'll say it again: most people don't deserve to breathe, let alone be happy.<<ref "b">> Some people think I'm misanthropic for the claim, and I'm betting that's a deflecting projection. That's a place nobody wants to face. It is a common lie I find in our species. You know that feeling you get or belief you ponder sometimes that we aren't good enough? It's true.<<ref "t">> So, at the end of the day, I think wisdom, both doxa and praxis, is actually worth obsessively pursuing with everything we have, even though I'm never wise enough; and, that's the biggest difference I find. The vast majority of people in society aren't trying to devote lives to being wise or [[wrestling]] to become wise, [[WINTCIS]].

<<footnotes "s" "Sir [[DeathOfRobinhood]] is intelligent, knowledgable, and wise to my eyes, but even he (like the rest of us) has significant limits on his ability to make his perspective on moral philosophy explicit. Me too, obviously.">>

<<footnotes "sk" "So many people enjoy the feeling of superiority in deconstructing the mainstream religious thought around them, but watch them refuse to put their skin in the game in [[reconstruction]]. That's how you know you're dealing with garbage. I am honored to meet those who keep seriously working on the problem even despite their profound skepticism and undue painful experiences with hypocrites and dark-triads who wield the memeplexes of morality as immorally as it gets, [[WINTCIS]].">>

<<footnotes "e" "Even by many who claim to believe in The Moral Law, especially as some rationalizing afterthought or mere virtue signal.">>

<<footnotes "b" "Among the many professors I've had who worked in moral philosophy, I had only two who clearly merited it (and, I think I'm incredibly [[lucky]] to have found even two in that rat race). I try to learn from anyone though.">>

<<footnotes "t" "Some consider it hubris that we should expect ourselves and [[others]] to reach for what often appears to be infeasible, if not impossible, moral requirements on our lives. [[ridtyawtr]], my ninjas.">>
