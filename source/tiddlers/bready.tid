** "I was born into a cult that had severe negitive effects on me. I won't go into detail about what happened there but  I will give you the highlights I was often hog tied up and thrown it to a dark closet for hours at a time. I was forced to eat bars of soap if I spoke the wrong thing. I wasn't allowed to have friends. I couldn't even read until I got out of it at the age of ~12 due to neglect. I think it fell apart at some time, and I was sent to live with my grandmother at some point."
** "After getting out of it I had a good 2 years, but I was put back in custudy of my parents who were very abusive. then my mom turned to drugs and even gave them to my me and my siblings. I don't remember what happened with my dad. I tried to speak up about it but no one listened for a long time. However CPS got involved in the end. about when I was ~16. I studied hard online and got a few certifications from college and got a job. I worked my way to getting an internship and thought it was all over."
** "Slowly my symptoms started to become more apprent when on my own. eventually it became obvious to the person running the intern ship I wasn't ok. Then they let me go. I had no where to go. eventually went to my grandma's house with. She got custudy of my siblings after everything with CPS was over. I was triggered a lot by being around them due to ptsd or something but I had no where else to go. I tried to get a job and stuff but my symptoms were so bad I couldn't."
** "I slowly became more dragged into the hell of issolation and my broken mind. I became a hikikomori about then. After a while I attempted suicide. then again and again and again and again and again. I thought no one could help me becaouse of my past. eventually I gave up, and decided to accept help. I started to get therapy and stuff. They diognosed me with severe disorders I do not wish to disclose and they realized how fucked up my mind was. They sent me to have therapy with a very exprenced pschologist. my psychyatrist put me on all sorts of meds."
** "I've been in therapy for about 2 years now. I have made a lot of progress in therapy, and they have me on meds that make me more sane. However I still have a long way to go, and I may not ever fully recover but I can try."
** "I don't understand why you assumed so many things about me, but I don't understand people to be honest. While my not fitting in to society may sometimes be interpated as being childish, I do not like to be taken care of. In fact I find it sad that people in society find people in need as being wanted to be taken care of. I held that beleife myself for a long time but I had to let go of it when I was in need and couldn't. I do not want help but I need it. I do not want your advice on getting my house. Not because your advice is bad, but because I have a situation that requires professional advice not stuff out of self help books. I thank you for your time and concerns about my mental health situation."
