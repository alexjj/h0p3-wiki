title: 2020.09.13 - Family Log: what else is new

!! Write a paragraph summarizing each person's week:

* [[1uxb0x]]
** 1uxb0x
*** My week was okay. My fun was mainly my imagination and my keyboard. Engineering might have a change to it soon, or it might not. I'm happy to be able to take a break from the downstairs. My sleep has been okay this week.
** j3d1h
*** Your paragraphs are very clean and pretty well-structured. I like them a lot, but you should feel free to also take informal, messy-looking notes! If you do that first, you'll probably find even more to write about when it comes to the paragraphs. Your Emacs key guide is handy - I hope you keep expanding it, I'm sure it will be useful to you! You seemed to have a decent week, but a lot of it probably felt like damage control for other people. I'm sorry about that.
** k0sh3k
*** I'm much happier with your schoolwork for this week! There's still more to do - you need to make sure you get entries for math, language arts, and engineering - but I liked your notes for your other subjects. I especially liked to see how you're thinking about what you're learning - for instance, where you consider why presidential terms are set to two terms or ten years. Critical thinking, FTW! Your writing is improving, although you're still having trouble with capitalization and apostrophes. That said, all I see in your wiki is school; I'd like to see more about what you're doing outside of school, too. I know you're reading Blood at the Root; what do you think of it? What else are you doing with your day? Where are you walking/running?
** h0p3
*** [[1uxb0x]] seemed to have an alright week. He was stable, talked a lot with his sister, and did his chores with coaxing. His imagination has been his favorite part of the week. He's not been running as much, and I'm hoping to be able to walk more with him. He wrote some for most of his mother's subjects. Engineering has bored him, and there's little proof of his math work. He has begun to pickup the basics of basics of emacs, and he continues to prefer to work in textfiles to his wiki. He still won't have non-school devices this week, and presumably his imagination is going to do more work for him this week.

* [[j3d1h]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I think you'd not like Space Station 13, I believe this is because it A: Limits your character, B: you have combat, people are unpredictable as in they could just kill you. So I don't think like it, but you never know! I think you've not been sleeping well, infact, I don't think anyone here has. Your week hasn't been good
** j3d1h
*** My week wasn't pleasant, but I made it. I didn't have motivation to do much of anything. I'm taking a short break from art, because I'm feeling a bit burned out, but I'll probably get back to it soon enough. Character building and RPing has been a struggle, and I'm glad Smokey helps out. I've been practicing with my butterfly knife, since it's just plain cool, as something else to practice besides what stresses me out.
** k0sh3k
*** I know you're doing your work - and enjoying it - because we talked about it. I wish I could see it in your wiki, just so we would have something to show for your portfolio and transcripts. It's important, and I hope you buck down to it. That said, I really hugely miss your Carpe Diems and Prompted Introspections and Antepleonasm Analyses, too. I don't know why you stopped writing, but I hope you start back up; especially since I feel like I don't have much time with y'all and the wiki is my way of knowing what you all are up to and interested in.
** h0p3
*** [[j3d1h]]'s week seemed uneventful and it felt like coasting. She's hanging in there. Her wiki is empty. It is only the evidence in her conversations that leads me to believe she's done anything. She's not feeling motivated for anything; I know that feel. A lack of devices seems to be harder on her than her brother (she still has Signal, and Saturday she was given her desktop back). [[Debatable]] has been fun, and I've enjoyed speaking with her. Maybe she's been curling up, anhedonic at the least. She made an African/Asian something chicken meal that was delicious; she's been enjoying spice more and more (I hardly recognize my daughter here). Cool to see her surfing Wikipedia to improve on the realism of her stories and characters.

* [[k0sh3k]]
** 1uxb0x
*** Thanks for the prompt! That mad-lad wanting those books really was kinda a dick. Your work has been tough this week for you, eh? Thank you for helping me with my elective. I think you had a bad-okay week.
** j3d1h
*** Your commonplace books were surprisingly frequent and filled-out! RM sounds awful, I'm sorry you had to deal with him at all. In fact, I'm sorry you have to deal with //everyone// who's been trying to get in the library. Your RCLs are similar to your sermons(?), and I like both, but there are some interesting differences between the two. The Spice house sounds good, but pretty much all of them (or all that I've heard you talk about) do.
** k0sh3k
*** I was, once again, very busy at work. I'm glad I had Monday off. I also started looking for a house, which would be cool. I'm looking for places to buy and places to rent; while buying would be cool, it's a huge investment, and I don't want to jump into it lightly - if we have to rent for another year, so be it. Still, the Nutmeg house is supercoolniftybeans. While most of my work at work was good - we got a //lot// done - I had an especially frustrating time with RM. I've been keeping an eye on the fires out west, and checked in with BS, who lives in Seattle; he and his are fine, so far. I hope they stay that way. This week a year ago, I was invited up for an on-site visit to Yale! It's been such a crazy year...
** h0p3
*** [[k0sh3k]] had another doozy of a week. Literally, lots of heavy lifting, but also so few breaks and time to vegg throughout the day. She continues to deliver in her vocation; it is so expensive, especially for someone as brilliant as she is. Thankfully, her head is above water. She has had some good days. She's even generously had the energy to walk with her husband. It was a joy to {[[dream]]} with her about a house; it's a light in the darkness and something soothing in the whirlwind. We can definitely feel that she's back on-site. It's now her 8th week having spent time on campus, so there's still a ton to learn too. She's hit the air flying. God damn, it has been a helluva year. It was a joy to read her RCL, to think about life together, and to lay my head in her lap to watch a show.

** 1uxb0x
*** I think you'd enjoy SS13 as it's called, but you might not like the roleplay side of it. My sister probably would like it less so. You haven't been sleeping well, if this gets bad we should get you some sort of medicine. Your school has been much more lax. What are those symbols in the second hub tab?
** j3d1h
*** I miss your maymays - they're the very best part (/jk). You really did write a bunch this week, but it feels much shorter without the chat logs. I'm wondering if you've been busier (or more tired) this week, since you seem to have fallen into a routine. Why do you insist on keeping all the disgusting stuff you find in your wiki? Also, there's no such thing as a stupid question, but you certainly ask irritating ones all the time.
** k0sh3k
*** I like that you are willing to not only listen to people think about things but will actively think about things with and for them. I'm glad that you're walking and talking with the kids, too; I hope we can walk more this week, but I also hope you'll keep walking with the kids, too. I do find it interesting how...intractable the kids can be in the face of having to listen to you encourage them endlessly to do their work; it seems like it'd be less effort to just do it? Quit sending me shit just to make me angry. :P
** h0p3
*** [[h0p3]] slept poorly, met few obligations, wallowed around, talked with folks, felt plenty lost, and consumed enough media to be committed. He doesn't want to consider that the whirlwind could get faster and more chaotic. He's worried to say the least. He's had a good week tho. Progress continues to be made. Plus: all the pleasure chemicals. Watching LoL playoffs has been a delicious waste of his life. Walks have been dope. He's been lucky to connect with people. He's been trying to find ways to [[BAGD]] and teacher, and he's gonna have to keep lookin'. Looking at the next move has been humbling.
