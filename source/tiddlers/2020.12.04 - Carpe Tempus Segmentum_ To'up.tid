title: 2020.12.04 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: To'up

* Read+Write
** Back is a bit sore. I'm tired. =)

* Fell asleep at 4:30
* Woke at 9
** Couldn't sleep. Excited, in multiple respects.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* More paperwork
** The sites they use are garbage. Cheap though.
* Set offspring onto tasks
* Picked up the truck, grabbed a larger dolly to go with my other two.
** I think the truck is trying to gaslight me.
* Packed some more.
* Dudes showed up early:
** Dillon, Rick, and James<<ref "r">>
* It took us 2.5 hours to load it up, and my offspring pushed hard too.
** Everyone was sore, even the pros.
** Tried to keep folks hydrated. Nobody wanted snacks.
** Chairman Meow was freaked the fuck out (she's already a twitchy spaz). I found her shivering in the bathroom sink trying to escape.
*** She had peed on herself. She eventually disappeared outside (reminds me of our last move).
** We got 95% of it, particularly the pieces that I can't move without a strong human. 
*** Speaking of which, Dillon was fucking ripped, 2% body fat. Shame my wife wasn't there for some delicious chocolate. 
** Learned that we can partially disassemble the couch through clips.
** Dillon was the primary packer, and he did a great job in the beginning. We could have packed everything, but that's okay. It was close enough.
** I called it since they were on a deadline (I'm willing to pay for more of their time, but they have another appointment).
* Hit //The Asylum//
** A neighbor, 2 doors from our left (at least, hard to tell) brought a 12-pack of beer for us. `/high-5`, my dude. I'll have to get him wicked hammered.
*** Embarrassed that I lost my mask. =/.
** Stupid fast to unload, and my offspring did a good job completing the assembly line to try to load the rooms fittingly enough. We had so little time. Took 45 minutes to unload the truck
** They stayed right up until their deadline (it took us longer than we anticipated). 
** Guys gave me fist bumps, I thanked them again, and then I gave them the beer. 
*** Google review complained they smelled like weed, but I didn't detect any. Seemed like they were friendly though. Maybe one day.
* Emptied some containers and went straight back to my old residence with the truck.
** Positioning that beast in the city sucks.
* We started loading the truck, but it started raining too hard. Fuck it.
* Called [[JRE]] Back
** I got interrupted earlier and didn't have time to speak at all.
** Adoption process is beginning!
** Recommended Tenet and (IRC) Lame
** VR and Teefs
* My wife was very unhappy that she couldn't find Meow, and then upset that the cats were not going to come with us. 
* Packed [[m16]] and some other goods into our car.
* Grabbed The Only chicken: Popeyes
** Been a long time. 
* Moved shit around to get our tables set, and we had a meal. I had beer too.
* We started moving shit into the basement that we could, and we set up a bed for my wife and a bit more.
* My knees are to'up.
** Pretty sure I need an Emotional Support Teenage GF to cheer me up.
* Took a bath (been almost a year).
* Read+Write
* //Skintime//
* Sleep by 11

Here's the weird part of the day: my offspring had a great time. u wot m8? I shit you not. Pure hell getting them to pack, but getting them to lift heavy objects all day, no problem. They were indispensable; we could not have done this without them. They worked exceptionally hard today, and something got done. Feels good, man.

My wife has been unhappy with the move. It's been too stressful for her, and her routine has been deeply violated. She understands. I wish it was cleaner for her. We must carve out spaces for her to just chill.
