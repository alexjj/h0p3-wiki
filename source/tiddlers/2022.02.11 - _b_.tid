A surprising amount of my identity can be understood by sensing what physically oozes out of me.

<br>

When I'm evaluating your [[faith]], I'm looking for where and why you choose which contradictions (including after attempting to consider epistemic closure).

<br>

Interpretation: Generally, I think you are stupid (not necessarily merely ignorant), evil, or suffering from dementia or some other non-trivial autonomy defeater (to some [[dok]]) if I never or rarely demand, question, argue, reason, condescend, shame, force, lecture, require you to remember, pick out where I have said something before, or deny your capacities. If you find me not [[wrestling]], but instead merely agreeing, diverting, distracting, reassuring, reminiscing, repeating, only doing what you find comfortable, only ever requesting without expectations, or encouraging with no negative feedback: I am not convinced we will be maintaining a serious, [[good]] [[faith]], bi-directional relationship among peers (though I rarely predict we'll achieve that in any case). I'll do my best for you, none-the-less, [[nomad]]. It is an honor to give, and I work hard not to give up [[hope]] on people.

Futarchist attempts to democratize governance while commodifying the means of political production by way of prediction markets neither escape the moral flaws of markets nor handle how picking the means often boils down to effectively picking the objectives in practice. Sure, values are non-trivially beliefs, and bets are non-trivially votes, and vv. to both. How are you going to give voice to the unheard, reactionaries?

This time it's different: it's all going to crash, and only I can save you with this one weird trick, so buy my unproductive asset for only three easy payments!
