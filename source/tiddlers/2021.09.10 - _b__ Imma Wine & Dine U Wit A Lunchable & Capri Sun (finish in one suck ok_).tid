title: 2021.09.10 - /b/: Imma Wine & Dine U Wit A Lunchable & Capri Sun (finish in one suck ok?)

I ran across a [[good]] yet tortured mind much like my own in the wild, and, yes, I am absolutely smitten, too. She is so personal, honest, elegant (no, shut up, fuck you, she's elegant), and violent with a purpose. Her mind is open and passionately reflective for someone who has experienced all that she has. Yeah, she's hawt. Lawd, I would eat and ream her out every night for as long as she let me just to hear her thoughts. I think I've lurked her longer than she has lurked me, and even where I don't agree with her views, she is extremely reasonable. I wish I could rub my brain (and bits) against hers and see what happens. I am positive I would //grow// in amazing and delightful ways (and I'll call her out on her bullshit, even gently where no one else is allowed to be). I'm a monster, `/wink`, and it takes one to know one. Yes, we would dirty each [[other]]. God forbid! XD. Thank the universe: she is a living end in herself, and an outlet of [[The Good]] [[Itself]] (whether she believes in such a thing or not, I'd wrestle her for as long as she could stand it). I'm immune to her poison, I worship her broken spark, and I'm just as insane as she thinks I am. Thank you for existing. What can I do to help?

No one is special in that everyone will be reasonable in expecting everyone else to be reasonable, except being offended at suggestions that they aren't reasonable.

Often, being a good person boils down to wrestling with one's demons without becoming one.

# Before asking, demonstrate that you care about the interlocutor and their answer.
# Appear relatively high-status and preface your question with a confession to set standards high and improve the odds of receiving a high-quality answer.
# Ask highly specific questions and follow-ups that prevent vague and low-effort responses.

I have been looking at [[k0sh3k]]'s approaches to the principal-agent problem, on top of the usual autistic problems. While I am obligated (sometimes joyously so) to [[ping|FTO: Ping]] strangers in the desert, I'm increasingly convinced that [[FTO]]'s mandate is usually best satisfied almost entirely by just listening (which is up to me) and providing completely passive, searchable information otherwise. Why ask that which can be searched? Sometimes one ought. Perhaps it is a token of The Robustness Principle taken to the extreme. Accepting social defeat (let me recognize I'm profoundly privileged, even as a weirdo), back into the hiki hole, I shall become an NPC like my teacher. Maybe I'll become like the madmen in EQ's SRo (if you can break 'em, dervish camps were better xp and loot, no interminable disease either). I [[hope]] to be wrong, of course.

Red state governors and hopefully the world are the winners in this mandate. Sucks about the governors, but I'm happy to see Biden take the hit for lying about the mandate 10 months ago. In any case, almost all Americans need to be accompanied by an adult (I hope mine has really good titties).
