I was gonnae ask how you were gettin oan

Hanging in there. Setting up a camp with my offspring. Been a simpler week.
Jul 10 1:51pm
How about you?
Jul 10 1:51pm
so, did you actually like any of the music?

feedback, dude! lol

Camping with offspring sounds relatively fun, depending on t he offspring ;) haha
Though I have great faith that yours would be amongst my favourites if I kent them.

Ed's hurt his back, again. He can barely move. We don't have a house to live in and no money to pay others to build it. So it gets tense and scary sometimes, and he can also be a real grumpy bastard! but anyway, overall things still good. I have work, which sucks, but also doesnae suck because, money.

Off I go lol

I enjoyed the music. Nothing I disliked. Heilung was my favorite of the bunch.

They enjoyed aspects of it. Next move is trying to convince my wife to join us out there. =)

I think you'd find my offspring interesting. Maybe one day you'll be able to meet them. That'd be cool.

What Heilung stuff did you watch? Lifa is worth watching all the way through if you have time. Maybe the bairns will like it?
Ed's only been in two - London Roundhouse Nov last year, and York Barbican this Feb. In the first he's the short guy in the back; in the second he's usually at stage right.

Have you seen the Norupo video? It's  pretty cool. I tell you right now, these folk were not pretending with the mushroom ;)

I hope I meet them, too. Maybe someday in the magic golden future where there is no virus and we have a house and you have money to visit. 

Hey, it could happen! :)

It could happen! Lol. I have a friend of my who may be traveling your direction in a couple years (she's been planning a trip). She's interested in meeting you.

That Norupo video is gorgeous.
Jul 22 1:03pm
I would like to know more particular songs from this genre that stand out.
Jul 22 1:06pm
is your friend on facebook?

The video is great, aye. although watching it after being at actual stone circles, occasionally it's like, get that shite aff the stanes! I want to see what they look like! lol

More particular songs? I can recommend Wardruna's first album, espeically a song called Algir Stien Klarnar. Here, this are two of our fave songs live:

You can also check out Folket Bortafor Nordavinden... not as good but they're the real deal. Real historian/reenactor types in the scandinavian scene fromwhich Heilung sprung.

It is possible that my friend https://sphygm.us/ has a FB account, but I would be surprised.
Jul 23 1:45pm
Gracias for the particular recommendations.

De nada :)
