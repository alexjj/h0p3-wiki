!! Audit:

* The house, on average, has been cleaner. I appreciate your work here.
* You definitely need joke [[title.Title]]s to match your incompetence. =). Keep going, sir. You're getting there.
* The move toward the 2-in-1's for their schoolwork is a gamble. Keep pushing to get it online, please.
* I like how you share you tools. You make a place that equips people in the moment of need often enough.
* You've had open tech on the brain in several areas.
* You obviously have mixed feelings about shopping here. You are fortunate to have the compound privilege of waiting, sir.
* You were smart to turn down the extra work. You'll need to keep doing that.
* Continue down the path of device restrictions wisely. That is such an expensive task to do well.
* You have failed to bang as much as you'd like. Might be a dryer season given CV19 too.
* My ninja, you and your laundry: I'm glad that it was smoother.
* You've worked to ease your anxiety, made space, taken meds, and triaged. Keep it up, sir.
* Yeah, [[Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση]] was not great this month. Either they are going to try or they won't. It's okay. Ups and downs.
* I think you should consider still playing more [[Guitar]].
** Actually, [[games]] in general have been weaker. I don't mind if you schedule some LoL dopamine hits too. 
* I'm [[grateful]] that you've gotten some of it out in [[Link Log]]. That place is quite a commitment.
* Note the math tutorial came alive into something pretty awesome.
* Conferences don't seem to be worth your energy. Why schedule them?
* [[Debatable]] has been an expensive experience. Keep going.
* [[urban-survivel.tdl]] was dope. Imperfect, but worthy. I'm glad you planned for it.
* Note that you did rip it out for him. 
** He has had more than his fair share of chances.
* I'm glad the IRS problem was resolved. It took longer than usual, and perhaps it will continue to take longer.
** Doubt it will matter this year. We'll see.
* Planning what you would watch had some acceptable results.
