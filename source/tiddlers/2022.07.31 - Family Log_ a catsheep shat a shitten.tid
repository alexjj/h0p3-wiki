* 1uxb0x
** It was alright.
* j3d1h
** meh. bad sleep.
* k0sh3k
** New meds are kicking in and kicking my butt. Headaches, upset stomach, sleep issues. Should go away in a week or so. Also, weird back problems.
* h0p3
** My knee has not liked all the weight I put on it. Bandaging seems to help. 
* ASK
** It is finally improving. I need to listen to my cravings more often.

!! What was interesting to you last week?

* [[5c0ut]] is a personal chef now. Dope. 
* [[D2]], //Hyperion//, //Redemption in Indigo//, //Arrested Development//
* Fridge seal blew out
* Big shit party was dope. Chicken, watermelon, topo chico. Grogg like tools too.
* SL got the job! (//Shhh, it's a secret still!//)
* My week has been good. My work was good, except for monday where I didn't report nearly anything. I'm playing games with my friends now-particularly enjoying playing baro with one. We got to go to the zoo, which was fun but time could have been better spent playing with friends, in my opinion. Father's thing rolled around, which was pretty cool. Nothing much happened this week otherwise.
* D2 and Hyperion. Rachel's story wrecked me. like, frantic sobbing wrecked. good times.
* This week was okay. I drew a big group of scrimblies for Alfred (my buddy), and he loved it. Telly has been coming up with a new world, potentially for a group RP with The Bastards. I've been watching a lot of D&D, so I'm getting a lot of very stolen (and a few less-stolen) character ideas. I'm also looking up bits of ASL, mostly trying to get some basic phrases and fingerspell faster for now.

!! Outside of our immediate family, who did we have significant social interactions with? 

* [[sabaLynx]], [[Root Users]], [[Noir]], Veggie Reggie, [[Sdsgfh Dgj]], [[ilaksh]]
* KH; Greek Group; Dr. G.; SE-H; SR
* telly, comic+myles, moon, vee, toby, chili, alfred, abby, jac, asa, andie, butter
* Fellow gamers.
* I spoke with two humans, though neither really enough to count as reaching out. I also spoke with a leopard and heron. They didn't talk back, but looked nonplussed about the whole thing.

!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family (including ourselves)?

* 1uxb0x
** I liked my work for math, specifically that it helps me understand why something does what it does.
** I like that you spend time tryin to make your notes legible, including formal sybolic and geometric representations. I hope you continue to work toward tooling like LaTeX/KaTeX, etc.
** Thank you for taking care of the cats.
** I appreciate that you interfaced with the cashier on behalf of the group. 
** Thank you for including bloopers in your notes! It is always helpful to record what you get wrong, so you recognize it when you encounter it again.
** you're taking better care of your hair! too fluffy :]
** Thank you for going to the zoo with me! thank you for being in such good spirits. thank you for helping to make that trip a cherished memory.
* j3d1h
** i'm apparently better at writing villains than i thought.
** Thank you for taking care of the cats. Taking charge of your responsibilities and your word too. Gettin' older.

** Thank you for helping me navigate today.
** You made a really cool piece of art for your friend!
** Thank you for allowing me a snatch a bit of food from you.

** Thank you for teaching me ASL and talking about its ethos and culture.
* k0sh3k
** I did a good job negotiating with my boss for a compromise on a project she wanted me to take over.
** You go out of your way to accomodate the needs of your users and those over whom you have power. I hope you will have the resources and wherewithal to continue to spend yourself on these people and others as you do
*** You do well working in pure text with people, and I adore how you give people the options to communicate as they see fit while offering the questions in advance. 
** You've done a good job hunting in the medical system. It's been painful reverse engineering yourself and mapping onto the constantly changing exploitative set of institutions with the resources you've had. I appreciate that you are taking the time to record the results.
** Thank you for thinkin' about our feelings and needs in your selection of Saturday activities.
** You did a great job saying "no," making space, limiting how much work people foist upon you, fighting back.
** Thank you for directing me what the heck to do at Popeye's, I had no idea.
** Thank you for allowing me to use your camera at the zoo, even though I never got the chance to end up using it.
*** If you'd like, I can show you how and maybe photography could be a subject next year?
**** Would be cool, and I am slightly interested in taking photos.

** Thank you for helping me track my reactions to my meds and for creating the nifty chart!
** Thank you for the carbonated water! I can see why it is your favorite, it's the most carbonated I've tasted.
** fantastic choice of food. popeye's is good.
** It is my joy to be near you every day. Thank you.
** Thank you for walking with me. I adore it being novel yet, and I look forward to as many walks together as we can reasonably pack in to whatever time life will allow us.
** Thank you for being you. I know it is not easy and it has taken a lot of work. I think you're Beautiful. Thank you for doing what you do.
* ASK
** Thank you for finding an option to seal the AC in, {working on. it is now spraying in two places and i may need a wrench and new three foot hose.} fixing the seal on the waterhose tap, and working on the fridge seal too. So many loose seals you been workin' on. Thank you.
** I've had a blast killing Baal with you. The kicker is, `/chef's-kiss`, perfect. I'm looking forward to //The Dresden Files//.
** Thank you for waking up in the middle of night to grab those tree trunks/branches with me.
*** If they are still there in a couple of weeks the twigs will be brittle and we might be able to wiggle a couple more loose, if you would like to go back.
**** =D. I wood like that.
** Thank you for preparing for today. It's been excellent.
** I appreciate your profound skill in shopping on behalf of everyone. You're constantly hunting for the fitting pieces to the puzzle. The droppers, medicine, bandages (both {fourteen, including nine different self adhesive bandage styles} types), topo chico, watermelon (it was spot on, btw), 
** Thank you for listening to my absurd gibberish that make no sense. I feel so much less alone when you listen.
*** We each grok each other's nonsense. That means it isn't actually nonsense, I think. Likewise though.
** Thank you for packing up the watermelon and water for the shindig today.
** you have a cool way of thinking that makes most places way more entertaining to be.
** Thank you for the snack bin.
