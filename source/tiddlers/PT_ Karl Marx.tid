; 1818-1883: Karl Marx 

* Reality is a historical dialectal process operating with alienations.
* Only when alienations end will we be free and in control, as parts of an organic society instead of selfish individuals.
* The world and the dialectical process of change consist of material (not spiritual) forces
* The dialectic works with the development of the means of production and the conflicts between social classes
* Institutions, religions, philosophies, the arts, etc. are determined by the economic substructure
* Religion is man-made; it is the opium of the people
* The Industrialist Capitalist society is the last stage before the end of history, of the dialectic.
* The development of technology (belonging to a few) is alienating people from the means of production
* The workers will overthrow the capitalists and create a class-free society where the means of production belong to all
