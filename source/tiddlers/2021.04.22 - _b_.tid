Mere achievement-subjects are obedience-subjects, even when they choose to be slaves to their passions and nothing greater (ofc, there is no autonomy without laws). Those who would claim that exploitation is possible without unjustified domination have not understood either the nature of our freedom or what we really owe to others and why we exist. Perhaps even egoistic self-exploiting entrepreneurs of themselves who predict a profit of enjoyment from their workaholism have obeyed a capitalist's commands to self-commodify (even if it is only their own) for the sake of mere fleeting pleasures at the long-term expense of the global poor's flourishing. To be clear: I am not claiming that sustained excrutiating work is wrong. Far from it (the lazy, apathetic, self-entitled parasites who refuse to acknowledge their own radical responsibilities to at least [[others]] are sinners too). But, [[FTSO]] what? There can be no theoretical or practical answer to capitalism without first acknowledging (even if we never fully comprehend), or at least having as our epistemic priors, a fit conception of the essence of personhood and its collective [[Telos]]. Yes, it is depressing that human beings can evolve into an animal that exploits both itself and others voluntarily without "external constraints," but that is qua free will. This problem of chosen evil is not new; it's not unique to the 21st Century. It's simply more explosive.

Just because a practice is so abstract that many practicioners end up relativistically assigning or eisegetically interpreting meanings (an empirical and contingent fact) does not imply that the practice cannot achieve progress toward something objectively valuable. Vicious practicioners don't make a practice conceptually unjustified. Thus, abstraction isn't the enemy; rather it's those who wield such things without seeking answers in good faith.

"You’re making things up, that never happened, and you’re being dramatic" //must// be inspected for gaslighting. Make no mistake, however: the common retorts can also be wielded maliciously, for even the gaslighter can use them to reinforce their own perspective and buffer themselves against [[justice]]. Plenty of dark-triads can dismiss justified accountability by claiming: "My feelings and reality are valid, don’t tell me how to feel because this is how I feel, I am allowed to explore these topics and conversations with you, I know what I saw, and I will not continue this conversation if you continue to minimize what I am feeling." Ultimately, we must provide better reasons for implementing and crossing boundaries.

I aim to maintain a semantic density just above the density of my ideal readership. Of course, rest assured, I could explain in easier language, but I've decided to show off instead. I just want to feel better about myself at your expense. Do you know what I'm saying? (Probably not). This is all just attention seeking behavior, and I'm only playing semantics, right? Basically, even if my ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 contained some valuable truth, it's a proof that truth isn't worth pursuing. Essentially, if I can't understand something with little effort, then I know it's pointless. Life is always that simple. Aaaaaaand....scene!
