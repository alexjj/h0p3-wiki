How was the date? And, how has your week been?
Jul 31 5:01pm
Good enough to have one since then ha
Jul 31 5:08pm
My week was crazy but golf
Jul 31 5:08pm
*good
Jul 31 5:08pm
How about y’all?
Jul 31 5:08pm
Ha. I'm glad to hear it.
Jul 31 5:09pm
What made your week crazy?
Jul 31 5:09pm
We're hanging in there. [[k0sh3k]] has a migraine today, and I'm tending to her. Trying to help her just relax and forget about work today.
Jul 31 5:10pm
We're cleaning and working on computers.
Jul 31 5:10pm
Ah well I had a date on Thursday after work and my work is pretty crazy since I’m always running outside with a toddler
Jul 31 5:10pm
But I like my time with Rakesh it helps me actually feel relaxing
Jul 31 5:10pm
Not sure what it is about him
Jul 31 5:10pm
Although Thursday evening was hard because I ended up staying without my pup and man that was difficult
Jul 31 5:11pm
First night I’ve been without Hendrix since I bought him in Jan
Jul 31 5:11pm
I can imagine being completely drained by a toddler, lol.
Jul 31 5:12pm
I’m sorry to hear about [[k0sh3k]]
Jul 31 5:12pm

You
I can imagine being completely drained by a toddler, lol.
lol
Jul 31 5:12pm
It’s actually Exhilarating
Jul 31 5:12pm
It's good that you have excellent adult company to balance that.
Jul 31 5:12pm
You are gifted with a lot of energy.
Jul 31 5:13pm
Lol yeah
Jul 31 5:13pm
I know I did it before, but I could not imagine doing it again.
Jul 31 5:13pm
I actually told Rakesh that we should take time to become good and close friends prior to thinking about anything else happening
Jul 31 5:13pm
Loose understanding of friends ha
Jul 31 5:13pm
It must be somewhat surreal not to have Hendrix with you. He's probably seen you through some difficult days this special year of 2020.
Jul 31 5:13pm
Absolutely
Jul 31 5:14pm
You never saw this ha
Jul 31 5:15pm

Screenshot of video attached to message
Jul 31 5:15pm
It’ll make [[k0sh3k]] laugh
Jul 31 5:15pm
I've never had a pet like that before, and this isn't a normal sounding comparison, but I do not fare well without my primary computer.
Jul 31 5:15pm

To each is there own
Jul 31 5:15pm
My fear with Hendrix is him dying I had to put down a dog when I was 15 and that experience scared me away from getting attached
Jul 31 5:16pm
Ah. Fuck yeah. I don't think I can handle that.
Jul 31 5:16pm
Haha, I'll be sure to show her. She could use the cheer up too.
Jul 31 5:17pm
You should watch it first ha
Jul 31 5:18pm
One of my favorite parts about how my wife sees you is that she says she "accepts you as you are" (a claim she very rarely makes about anyone, imho).
Jul 31 5:18pm
I did, lol.
Jul 31 5:18pm

Wow that’s pretty much how I wish my mom could see me
Jul 31 5:18pm
Can I adopt y’all as parents
Jul 31 5:18pm
That’s also how I see [[k0sh3k]]
Jul 31 5:19pm

You
I did, lol.
He made me close the roof for a photo ha
Jul 31 5:19pm
He made me promise not to share that so mums the word
Jul 31 5:19pm
You can adopt us as your brother and sister, lol. Technically, [[k0sh3k]] is old enough to be your mom, she's got 9 years on me as it is.
