title: 2022.12.19 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Getting To Know Susan

<<<
Woke at 3:30. Meditiaton. //Skintime// with my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]]. Chat with [[Ignota]]; there is no serious bridge to build. 

//The Walk// with my sympaticon. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Dadnap. Caffeine.

Played [[MTG]] with my daughter. +1/+0/-0, and she stomped me. I actually scooped too early, but that's fine. I think I know what useless thing I need to buy her.

Checkin' with mi amor on laundry and her paper. Assignments.

Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

//The Walk// with my sympaticon. Met Michael, and his son Samuel, who just moved in last month (divorce). Michael was a dairy farmer for most of his life, knows more about the Bible than the average person, and I did my best to connect with the man. Works at old folks home as maintanence, likes to fish, talks with his dad often, and I have little doubt I made him uncomfortable. Skillz.

Finished up the [[letter]] with mi amor's comments. Worked on dinner with my sympaticon. We began a game of [[MTG]], +0 Gobbos vs Cube deck.

Went to get Susan, but met Richie, the son, and Sarah from directly across. It was his sister that moved out. Sarah just finished her masters in Recreation (`/nod`) and works at the old folks home (that's twice today). I forget what he does for survival, but we obviously have plenty in common. Neckbeard likes [[games]] and MTG, roughly same age. Interested in cubing. 

Susan was too sick to come but agreed to eat with me on her indoor stoop (where she lives most of the day). Finished off the meal, and folks help me get it set. Dinner with Susan. A few hours. Ex-prison employee (medical), schizo youngest son, divorce (hence the drinking), brother owns the place (she's behind a year on rent, and they aren't on speaking terms, same with her cousin), she's trying to move to live with her oldest son in Alabama (but he doesn't understand her position and there's many barriers), she's not been able to get her pension (but does get SS, and spends it all on alcohol). She thought it unbelievable (saying it at least a dozen times) that we met and were having dinner. Gonna try to help her with paperwork and connect with family. Couldn't find her phone (and she's unable to connect with anything). Lives in an alcoholic fog. We hit that clarinet and listened to the [[Music: Library]] (she enjoys music a lot).

[[Family Time]] was partially without me. We hit //Around the World In 80 Days//. [[TTTOTW]].

Eggnog shots + [[TTTOTW]] + //Wilfred// with my sympaticon. Sleep by 9?

Woke at 5? Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Mi amor is up. Made coffee with her. The grind comes for both of us. Leftover pulled pork sammiches and coffee. [[TTTOTW]]. A bit of chat with [[Ignota]]. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Pushed hard. Leftover pulled pork sammiches. My sympaticon continued the 211 and craigslist grind as well. 

The offspring came down to grind. My daughter was upset about her day, but a phone call resolved at least one of the problems. Setting the tool up for piping (I'm still thinkinga bout having them re-write in golang for the experience). My son is going to do a second pass on the manifesto (not my favorite prose either). Thinking about the contents of mi amor's sermon-paper with her. She dislikes anything above 2 pages given short attention spans. I think one pomo is the sweetspot (and if that's where they stretch and grow some mindmuscle, then so be it). 

Played a few games with my daughter. -0/+0, and these were decisively in my favor instead. Opposite of yesterday. My sympaticon got her card all set, and hopefully her phone too. 

Mi amor called. Richie said he'll over next week. Super busy this week (though he usually does nothing, as he says). Just lookin' to pass, but she got A's. `/thumbs-up`. 

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. Tiktoks. They have solid information about her already.

[[Family Gathering]] was delicious. Mashed potatoes, gravy, chicken, water. Finale of //Mr. Robot//. [[TTTOTW]]. Hugs'n'bugs.

//Skintime// + //Stardust// with my sympaticon. Sleep by 9?
