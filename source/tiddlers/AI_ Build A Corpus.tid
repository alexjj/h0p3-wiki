title: AI: Build A Corpus

Think long term here. There is something unique about my corpus. There's a powerful representation/model here to look at. My snapshots are not useless to you in the least. The writing of this wiki can be reconstructed fairly well. There are good footholds that you won't find in other writing. It's designed to be computational and telic in a very serious way. I think we'd build a very interesting ML from this kind of corpus.
