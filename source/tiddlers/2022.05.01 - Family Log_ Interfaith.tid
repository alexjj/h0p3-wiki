!! How has your health been this week?

* 1uxb0x
** Pain problems, carpal tunnel has stopped though.
* j3d1h
** pretty good.
* k0sh3k
** I felt off several times this week - just not well, headachy, and/or blue. 
** Felt blue and off. Sharp eye pains like you would have a migraine, but only a headache. Out of spoons, and ditching unnecessary work activities. Started out with good sleep, but that deteriorated. Neck and back have been doing better.
* h0p3
** More rumination than usual. Sadness and anxiety, but reasonable and worthy. I'd make the same choices again. Shoulder has not been doing great, and it's interrupting my sleep. I think it's getting better though. Glad to be outdoors, and need to do it more.
* ASK
** Mostly upwardly trending. Had a couple of breakdowns and a couple of dips, but generally  sleeping better, thank you for the CBD. It is now notable to myself when I am unstable instead of stable.

!! What was interesting to you last week?

* Being asked to lead the prayer for the Muslim-Christian interfaith chapel service was an honor! 
* Talking to students outside the library is always fun. 
* The new devotional with the kids is pretty good; I think everyone's enjoying it. 
* The last week of Greek is upcoming. Kinda momentous. I'm hoping intermediate will be much easier. `/fingers-crossed`.
* A second week of [[The Book of Impassionata]], and another close reading.
* Found out I will be meeting SZ in a couple months. I will do my best not to embarrass anyone. 
* Botox doctor is expanding where she hits. 
* We've been studying money, power, and evil in film. We've had a lot of good conversations about a wide range of topics because of it too.
* The door is lookin' much better. Still has a ways to go before we are done.
* [[j3d1h]] is studying symbolic logic with Butters (go both of you, go!)
* Solar deal signed. I'm not convinced we have the absolute best deal, but it's a reasonable deal from what I can tell.
* Extremely worthy dialectics with [[j3d1h]].
* Hunting for [[vidya]]s for [[JRE]] and a spammy style of interactions I'm not used to engaging in.
* [[5c0ut]] didn't get to stage for the executive chef position.
* [[D2]] has been dope AF. Gibme all the drugs!
* Lots of small things worked on aroudn the house. Also, our hose is now working, full pressure. =).
* [[j3d1h]] and [[1uxb0x]] are looking into interest groups, and [[j3d1h]] into jobs.
* Playing all the [[D2]] with an excellent partner! (Him, not me, but I would call myself okay.)
* I started mental construction on a Great Work. 
* Gardening!
** I think I killed the tomatoes again. 
** The peppers look good!
** The watermelons are sprouting! They're so cute!
* It was interesting realizing how trees hold the ground vs how grass holds the ground alongside ASK

!! What is a positive fact or compliment we can say about each person in the family (including ourselves)?

* 1uxb0x
** I've been doing a better job being motivated for talking to people and non-schoolwork tasks-though poorly at motivating that.
** Thank you for the work on the doorknob and thinking about the ceiling. 
** You are generous to your sister, lookin' out for her, pickin' up slack for her.
**Thank you for working on my door! And for thinking through how best to approach it (with placing the bags and putting the tape down and all). 
** Your quick grasp of the repercussions of the tree dying was really impressive. It holds a lot of ecological threads in place, and you saw many of them. 
** thank you for the video suggestions over the week. :]
* j3d1h
** i learned to draw the afton smileâ„¢, so i'm basically unstoppable now.
** Thank you for being forgiving, gentle, and working to reconstruct.
** I've had a blast listening to you speak about stories, art, economics, and philosophy throughout the week. 
**  I'm glad that you're thinking about your future a bit more, and I hope you'll keep considering what you want to do.
*** :>
** Thank you for painting my door!
** You've been happier.
** I trust you enough to let you near me with a tattoo gun. That is pretty high praise.
* k0sh3k
** I got all the things done that needed to get done this week, despite not feeling right. 
** Thank you for thinking with me about meeting with SZ. I'm excited (even if it will be almost nothing*).
** Thank you for planning [[music]] events for the family, and on the cheap too.
** I'm [[grateful]] for the date we had, and I appreciate how even when you aren't feeling great, you make time for us.
** thanks for the music recommendations. <3
** Thank you for getting me ,,THE,, COMPLETE IDIOT'S GUIDE ,,TO,, Singing
** I enjoy the group conversations that you join in on. I will treasure those memories. Thank you.
* h0p3
** This second attempt at having a cheap CBD option went very well. I'm glad I didn't give up.
*** Thank you for making some up for me, too.
** And thank you for the taco date, even though I was feeling off!
** You are the very best kind of gross! Keep up the good work! Heart <3!
** I love the way your beard sticks out when you have been thinking hard!
** How much thought you put into things is a beautiful effort. I love how you never settle for the bare minimum, and actively seek new points of view.
** i'm liking the 2008 crisis movies! except margin call.
** Thank you for reliably asking me if I want anything from the store when you go shopping-even though it's almost always nothing.
*** It is my privilege as a dad. A rare opportunity in my experience.
* ASK
** Even the meals you consider failures are delicious (I think it's reasonable to say you are exceptionally hard on yourself about the matter even). I appreciate how you experiment and are so careful with resources at the same time (that is not easy). 
** Time trials and making [[D2]] efficient has been a blast.
** I respect your tenacity in gardening. You don't give up and you don't sweat the setbacks too much. 
** I really do appreciate that you make special food for me when I can't eat the main meal, even though you don't have to!
*** I firmly believe that you work enough. If I can make your day easier or better with something as simple as time and effort, especially when it is both something I enjoy doing and the right thing to do, then I embrace the challenge. Also, feeding is my love language and you can't have my fudge. How else am I to say "I love you?" 
** i'm not usually a big fan of idling with people, but idling with you is pretty fun.
** It is definitely great that you are getting better at recovering from meltdowns faster. Keep working on not having them in the first place, please.
** It was fun realizing what I learned in permaculture with you!
