title: 2020.07.21 - Prompted Introspection: Delusionally Talented At Deluding Myself

!! Tell about something you do well?

[[2019.08.01 - Prompted Introspection: Do Well]] is juvenile, immature, disgusting, and simply inappropriate. I'm disappointed in myself. I'll agree that I could survive without sex, but damn, that would suck.<<ref "s"> I don't think I could survive without human touch though, and sex is clearly the best method to feed my massive skinhunger.<<ref "i">> 

Alright, onto something I do well (this is, like, my favorite kind of question): I can be grandiose, I can exaggerate, and I can be proper foolish, especially when I'm narcissistically talking about myself. I like taking things too far, turning everything into a penis, imagining them to (supposedly) the absurd N^^th^^ degree, finding the edges and loopholes, etc. Contradictions make me giggle. Or, better yet, I am delusional in thinking I do this thing well. What I'm saying is: I get my delusions on well. Mad skillz.
