Happy new year! Let’s kick some ass in 2021 :)
Jan 1 11:37am
=). Happy New Year, sir!
Jan 1 3:03pm
I hope your day is restful and your work fruitful!
Jan 1 3:29pm
It’s going to be a good year :)
Jan 1 3:30pm
You too! =)
Jan 1 3:30pm
You gearing up for school?
Jan 1 3:30pm
Trying not to think about it
Jan 1 3:30pm
<_<
Jan 1 3:30pm
Ah, well, enjoy the holiday.
Jan 1 3:30pm
You guys gettin' some good gaming in?
Jan 1 3:31pm
Aye, playing in a one shot right now. Sorry for being quiet.
Jan 1 6:47pm
What are you all up to on this lovely evening?
Jan 1 6:47pm
You all good, homie. I'm glad to hear it.
Jan 1 7:33pm
Sex, food, a party, magic, now to try to take over the world.
Jan 1 7:34pm
Hell yeah. Beat that ass!
Jan 1 9:06pm
Err...the world’s
Jan 1 9:06pm
.....unless
Jan 1 9:06pm

How are you today? :)
Jan 4 3:24pm
I'm doing well.
Jan 4 4:27pm
Or well enough, lol
Jan 4 4:27pm
Curling up, keeping my head down, being practical
Jan 4 4:28pm
How about you?
Jan 4 4:30pm
Took a mental health day today. Long shower and other health-related things. I’m feeling a lot better though. :) 

Got my first email about school and it’s starting to set in that I’m about to be swamped again.
Jan 4 4:32pm
Gonna get a lot done though. Only three semesters to go!
Jan 4 4:32pm
Yes, sir.
Jan 4 4:32pm
When does the whirlwind begin again?
Jan 4 4:37pm
The 11th. One more week. 😭
Jan 4 5:02pm
That's when the offspring are supposed to be begin as well.
Jan 4 5:15pm
What’s their curriculum looking like these days? They doing any better?
Jan 4 5:22pm
No difference on curriculum. They aren't doing better in general, and I don't predict they will try.
Jan 4 11:48pm

Hey. Hope you’re doing well today. :)
Jan 6 1:33pm
Hanging in there. How about you?
Jan 6 5:00pm
Watching DC burn. It’s incredible.
Jan 6 5:01pm
This is going to end up in our history books.
Jan 6 5:01pm
I appreciate their violence. They don't seek the fitting ends, sadly.
Jan 6 5:09pm
What little pride the republicans party had left is completely gone by this point. It’s amazing.
Jan 6 5:10pm
Cant wait for Inauguration Day so all this mess can start getting sorted out.
Jan 6 5:11pm
Biden is also an incredibly evil human. I am not convinced the mess is going to be sorted out. Capitalists own both parties. This is a spectacle.
Jan 6 5:12pm
Aye. You’re right.
Jan 6 5:12pm
It’s the country we live in. 😞
Jan 6 5:12pm
Yes, sir.
Jan 6 5:12pm
How are you doing health-wise? Allergies and sleep improving still?
Jan 6 5:13pm
Still curling up.
Jan 6 5:13pm
It is expensive watching the world burn.
Jan 6 5:13pm
I am good though. My obligations are met, and I have significant autonomy.
Jan 6 5:15pm
Treat yourself to something nice today. You deserve it. <3
Jan 6 5:15pm
Nice! Autonomy is good :)
Jan 6 5:15pm
I hope to get a walk or some sex, lol.
Jan 6 5:15pm
The best treatz
Jan 6 5:15pm
Those both sound amazing.
Jan 6 5:15pm
I’m about to make us dinner I think. Been an extra lazy day.
Jan 6 5:15pm
Whatcha having?
Jan 6 5:16pm
Tortellini pasta! Homemade. :)
Jan 6 5:16pm
It’s been awhile and it sounds incredible.
Jan 6 5:16pm
Insane. Sounds like art to me.
Jan 6 5:16pm
What will you have inside?
Jan 6 5:17pm
I think these are shredded chicken! They’ll be incredibly filling. :)
Jan 6 5:20pm

Hope your day is well so far. What do you plan to accomplish?
Jan 11 11:43am
Not sure yet.
Jan 11 4:13pm
Day begins late for me these days.
Jan 11 4:13pm
Absolute nightowl mode.
Jan 11 4:13pm
Evening hours are the most peaceful/ productive imo. haha
Jan 11 4:17pm
[[L]] would quickly correct me if I were to say that in earshot. <_<
Jan 11 4:18pm
Here's how I'm looking so far. Still in progress and waiting on more schedules: https://docs.google.com/document/[[REDACTED]]
Jan 11 4:19pm
Yes, sir. That seems like a lot to do. It's happening, dude. =)
Jan 11 4:22pm

❤️
This will be my final intense, academic semester. 2 summer classes and 2 fall classes are left after this.
Jan 11 4:23pm
coinciding with student teaching**
Jan 11 4:23pm
It's terrifying, almost had a panic attack earlier, but the more I add to the schedule and the more I interpret these syllabuses, the better I feel. It's going to just be more of the same.
Jan 11 4:24pm
Yeah, I'm feeling confident you're gonna crush it. I appreciate how daunting the semester can look. I always have jitters about it myself.
Jan 11 4:48pm
I guess what makes it scary is that I’m still working and expected to do field hours in addition to everything. But I agree with you. Despite my apprehension I think I’ll do very well.
Jan 11 4:55pm
Please hold me accountable. 👀
Jan 11 4:55pm
I'll be there with you, sir.
Jan 11 4:56pm
2021 does not look like it is going to be a slow down or a break from 2020.
Jan 11 4:57pm
Oh yeah. Ever the busy bees haha
