title: 2021.11.24 - Prompted Introspection: Quotes

!! Do you have any favorite quotes? Capture 3 of them here.

Yes? I have no idea how to narrow down my favorites. The ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 contains my favorites (as [[Tapeda the Dragon]] has pointed out, there are many), that's why they are in here. Like [[APonting]], my collection is extensive, and unlike him, they are distributed throughout my work. It's chaos. Ugh. Alright, I'll pick a few out that tickle me right now.

Goodwill shines forth like a precious jewel.

I enjoy lining quotes up to tell a story.<<ref "h">>

I have been praised for my ability to make other people's words say what I want them to. I don't know how true that is (especially when it comes to shaping conversations), but I think the way I modify quotes shows our conventions are worth breaking. I adore the concision + precision in [[wrestling|wrestle]] with [[The Other]] by injecting just a couple qualifiers. No need to write a wall-of-text when there was plenty of healthy tissue to save.
