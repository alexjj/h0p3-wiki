No shortage if you pay enough, a.k.a. inflation?

Looking to sit in on a never-ending oberseminar on Saint Kant, talking our way to emancipation.

Mere irreverence and egoistic postpostanarchism (so brave) are no substitute for questioning authority with integrity.

How to be happy without being moral: be realistic^^tm^^ but assume the best, seek win-win-win scenarios, don't empathize with the world but be compassionate with whomever is in front of you (feel good about yourself, but make sure you heavily control who can access you, including convenient curation of your media), sacrifice the needs of the many to be generous to your in-group just like everyone else, don't read the news or argue about what the world should be like, don't feel compelled to fight against nazis or capitalists, and convince yourself that the good deed you did was really the right one to do.

!!! NEVER

Do Your Best

!!! QUIT

Most homo sapiens I encounter are a condom commercial, or at least a living, breathing oral sex argument (through your nose). Having a [[phenomenology]] does not entitle you to just any existence. Most have dignity they decline for more pleasure. Like a firebender, I will channel every ounce of my aggression that I would turn inward (i.e. depression) into this ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 and redirect it into The World. My "fuck you" has only begun.
