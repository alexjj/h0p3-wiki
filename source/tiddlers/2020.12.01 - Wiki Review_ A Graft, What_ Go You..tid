title: 2020.12.01 - Wiki Review: A Graft, What? Go You.

* [[2020.09.16 - AA: Need Break]]
** She did not get her break. 
** Can't be easy to process given the conservative background and context.
* [[2020.10.03 - AA: Chicken Town]]
** The curl-up continues. The wiki is still online. The answers can be found.
*** To a non-trivial [[dok]], I don't have a problem with someone asking me how I'm doing when I know they have thought about the wiki. It is, after all, a pile of gibberish. 
**** We each choose our channels. 
** Lmao, yeah, "Lucky Her" indeed! [[UJ]] is hella troll too, so she know how it do.
** Those chickens may even more prove useful yet. I hope not.
* [[2020.10.29 - AA: Vermont Travel Plans]]
** Two sets of plans, one didn't get to happen for her, and the other looks like it may be pushed back for a while.
** I'm excited to see them. I have no idea what we'll talk about, but I will put food in their bellies, and my banjo or guitar in my uncle's hands, and I'll try to find a way to connect with [[AG]] (lawd, I have failed). 
** I appreciate how my aunt pre-emptively provides information in a redundant fashion on the assumption that it would be reasonable to have forgotten it (similar with some of the pictures she has sent multiple times). She knows that my memory is often poor. There is a graciousness and generosity to the way she provides context.
* [[2020.11.16 - AA: Anxious Antihistamines]]
** I'm not too worried about it, but I think it's something to keep in our pockets. 
** I had seen her links before. I had considered sending her others I had pulled up, but I'll hold off. These are not easy decisions to make. 
** I've not tried it yet. Need to do that. 
* [[2020.11.30 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Cleaning]]
** I think once we move, hopefully for the final time, she may feel better. I know she has to be tired of moving. 
* [[2020.11.30 - Prompted Introspection: Expressing Love]]
** This one needs another look, but I need to walk away from it first. It actually might add to [[Love]]. Invert it first. I know it will not be a well-liked answer. Justification ranges over mere attachment.
* [[2020.11.30 - Wiki Review: Less Verbose]]
** Well, I still get to talk about it in my [[review]]s. Everquest will always be this impossibly high standard of gaming for me. Does it help me slice through the hedonic treadmills and bullshit of the industry? Yeah. They didn't call it Evercrack for nothing. It was a hard game to quit. I wish I saved the letter I wrote to my guild.    
* [[2020.10.05 - Tapeda the Dragon: Barbaric Babblings]]
** There is skin in the game here, but there also isn't enough. 
** I get to speak my gibberish with this person, and they speak theirs with me. We are schizos together. I am regularly shocked by this person's ability to interpret me.
*** They are also skilled at eliciting responses that I normally do not say out loud.
** I think we mimic part of the [[hyperconversation]]'s slowness over this channel. One side listens while the other talks, and it's actually rare for us to both be simultaneously speaking. I have no idea what to make of it.
*** I'm blind by comparison. I do not have the ability to read their wiki. The asymmetry is something I will always have to contend with. 
*** I work hard to digest this person's words on the fly though. I don't have a careful construction, but I do allow their words to sit with me before I respond. 
** Tapeda is fucking hilarious. They scan me then press the action button.
* [[2020.10.07 - Tapeda the Dragon: Prescriptivity]]
** There's not a good way to divide the conversations. I'm not finding good breakpoints.
** I continue to run into folks who like the shows my wife does. 
** A lot of people wish I wasn't so constantly serious in conversation. We have an extremely limited window, and I have to be somber, sober, serious, and so forth; but, this is true of any time segment. 
** My offspring and I have been thinking about this Voevodksy analogy. 
*** Tapeda picks out interesting people left and right. 
*** Coincidentally, also, died at the age I've predicted for myself.
** There is a contradiction in the story of sneaking into academia here. Could be a projection, could be a miscommunication, could be something else. I don't understand.
* [[2020.10.08 - Tapeda the Dragon: Algorithmic Matriarchs]]
** Discussions of AI (qua intelligence at all) without discussions of [[The Good]] (and hence [[The Right]]) are pointless. From what I can see, most of the people who understand one section reasonably well do not understand the other. 
** I had initally assumed there was small honeypot here, but I may be wrong. I'm willing to offer my offline information to this person. They have tried in hard places with me. Also wondered if it was another signal (anons get to masquerade hard). Schizo gonna schizate.
* [[2020.10.13 - Tapeda the Dragon: Orchestration]]
** Tapeda is a poet, or to my uneducated eyes at least. When I was younger, I would have thought these were mere scribblings, and I'm [[grateful]] to have been shown otherwise. There's probably something extra special because they speak multiple standard natural languages. 
** Disconfirmation on the signal.
** Very high openness in this person.
* [[2020.10.18 - Tapeda the Dragon: Prisms]]
** Excellent quotes, but I need definitions too. There is work here, and I can see it. I don't know how to bridge fast enough either. I am also such a cold-hearted bastard in some places. 
** Our discussion feels like one big pile to me, lol. Certainly, these are walls of text.
*** We rely upon mapping the references by hand a lot here (and trusting the other to do so).
** I feel the weight in their words. When I am handed their feelings and understandings, I [[aim]] to complete [[Sphygmus]]'s conception (of what I understand) of [[sharing]], of seeing my responsibility in caring for them. 
*** Sometimes I feel like I tend to be the static structure and others are the dancing and blinking wild lights. It takes both. I don't know. It is an image I can't trust well enough.
* [[2020.10.25 - Tapeda the Dragon: Love & Fear]]
** I will not be the person to bask with there. I appreciate why one would not wish to. 
** I suggest Tapeda has read non-trivial sections of [[FTO]]. There's too many seeming references for me to take it to be coincidence, and they are a strong interpreter.
** They have a profound natural talent for vertiginous and paradoxical aspects of philosophy. I hope they will be able to find their voice not just for themselves but for [[others]] over the coming decades. 
** //Dune// keeps coming up, but I have no idea what we are talking about.
** Yeah, I see my own projections in here too. 
** Yes, there is a skin in the game problem here. I am putting it on the line though.
*** I don't know how to thank them for helping me openly recognize that I am poly. It's not just lust (though, I am one horny bastard).
**** My wife has always been open to that for me (she's been in such a relationship before when she was young), but it wasn't something I thought was even possible for me (how could I find a mind like hers any where?).
**** Thinking about how people think about how people think about how people think, and so on. I have layed it on the line here too. 
** That test has been interesting for lots of my [[Root Users]].
** Definitely a hidden figure to me, lol.
** Capitalization signal plagues me yet again. 
* [[2020.10.28 - Tapeda the Dragon: Duty In Sharing]]
** We have danced around the topic of normativity considerably. I recognize how painful it must be. The stamp of the dragon comes into play. It is [[Wiki Litmus Test]].
*** I have worked to give space here.
** I take doing it live with them seriously. There are few that require that level of {[[Focus]]} from me.
** It is not fun revealing the darkness in ourselves. Tapeda does so kindly and humorously, and real time too. It's raw talent.
* [[2020.11.19 - Tapeda the Dragon: Split Live]]
** Timing is sus, lol. Still, it may just be coincidence. 
** Quite a thing to ask, I realize.
** This round we did it live then I did a second pass. 
** He pays a very high compliment to me. 
** Interval between conversations continues to grow. 
* [[2020.11.13 - BDS97: New Tox]]
** It is difficult to know how to use our talents wisely.
** I'm surprising myself here, but my prediction is that eventually he will change his mind and come back to working on justified FOSS.
** He has an incredibly active plebbit account. I spend more time thinking about him than he does about me, but that goes for most in my life (tis my job).
