"64TB of memory should be enough for everyone" echoes famous last words. My grand donor said the exact same thing about 64KB of memory long ago.

`/whistle`. If you don't have a justified reason for believing someone is below you in a context, then maybe there isn't anyone below you.

Indeed, UFOs, demon possession, and The Lizard People are perhaps sometimes near-religious coding attempts to metaphorically explain evil infiltrations of the hyperbojects surrounding us. Not all [[others]] are moral creatures, and thus we must pierce veils, peel away masks, and uncover the truth of the intentions of those in [[power]] over us (as is our right). Those who can change their appearance at-will require careful scrutiny. We must screen for cunning sociopathic dispositions and unjustified predation (I can see it in your eyes: I'm watching you. I'm [[fff]]ingly measuring and predicting your distortions in the psychopathic signaling meritocracy...). There's nothing like experience to teach us that some homo sapien specimens oscillate between innocuous flat affect and aggressive violence (in many [[dok]]) on the flip of a switch in pursuit of their own egos (in the will to power) through The World as mere means. Problematically, pablumatically denying their existence is just as damning a consensual mass hallucination, and I know why you do that too. Doesn't look all that different to me. 97%.

Like the capitalist's marketers of utopia, let us beware the transhumanist's conveniently undefined and open-ended gambling-pursuit of upside risk at the expense of present day injustice around the world.

I'm cool enough to avoid virtue signaling. How about you? Are you, like, so above it too?
