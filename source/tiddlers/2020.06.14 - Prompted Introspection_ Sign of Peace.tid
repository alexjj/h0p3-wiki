title: 2020.06.14 - Prompted Introspection: Sign of Peace

!! Describe a favorite letter you have received.

[[2019.03.31 - Prompted Introspection: A Fruitful Gift]] + [[2017.12.09 - Prompted Introspection Log: Favorite Letter]] still make me tear up. It is important that I also reason about other [[Letters]]. I am a lucky man to have received letters from [[others]].

[[2018.10.24 - AA: Tatted]] is one of my favorites. It's a commitment to trying again. I [[hope]] to live up to this letter. Beyond the content, even the word choices echo through the decades for me. It is a reminder that our words can be constructive, practical, and worthy. I am grateful to have the chance to build our lives together. I see her autonomy, forgiveness, and goodwill in her letter. I appreciate her empathy, persistence, and honesty. 

As a paranoic, I know how expensive it was to write this letter. We compute on behalf of each other. It's a bridge, a hand to hold, a sign of peace. 

Do we have the relationship I want to have? No. I predict that we will always be at arms length in a way. Wrestling with me is painful. I am glad that she shapes the conversation with me, picking out what is [[salient]]. I see inferences that demonstrate charity and humility. It gives me [[hope]] not just for us but for [[Humanity]]. We can do it.
