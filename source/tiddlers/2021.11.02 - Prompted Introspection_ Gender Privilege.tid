title: 2021.11.02 - Prompted Introspection: Gender Privilege

!! Do women have any systemic privilege due to their gender?

Some, of course. [[How systemic|https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-580de97288d0e7ebedeb629c4de76c4e-pjlq]]? It depends on how we draw the boundaries here. In the first world, on average, I think it's easier to be a moral woman than a moral man, and that's a privilege I'm concerned with. Global eudaimonia metrics for men tend to be swept under the rug in my experience; I see MRAs dismissed just as fast as feminists of yore in mainstream discussions (though, I find most people are more reasonable in-person on the topic).

I think being so thoroughly desired for sex (and related desirables) is a privilege, prima facie.<<ref "w">> Current sexual markets clearly demonstrate that women are wanted more than men.<<ref "c">> As far as gender is concerned, there are non-trivial evolutionary pressures in the winner-take-all developed world to be feminine, especially in presentation. Elite male gaze is its own radical privilege, of course, but most masculine humans are not the benefactors. 

The question is quite broad though. Pick a system, and we may be able to find clearer and often competing answers. The vast majority of privilege in the world has little to do with gender directly. Class is the fundamental problem.
