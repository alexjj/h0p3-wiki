How are you doing?
May 25 1:47pm
Good how are you?
May 25 1:53pm
I am working on garden things â€”outside is so neglected
May 25 1:53pm
Hanging in there. Grinding away.
May 25 1:54pm
I think our garden is likely to die, lol.
May 25 1:54pm
They don't look like they are flourishing.
May 25 1:54pm
Yeah I work a bit and then sit a bit
May 25 1:54pm
Oh that sucks
May 25 1:55pm
I am not sure how ours will work
May 25 1:55pm
Yeah. It's a long-shot anyway. Our neighbor who moved in (has owned the place for decades) says the soil sucks.
May 25 1:56pm
I just hope to complete things...I am the queen of half done
May 25 1:56pm
You been banging it out. That coop is sick.
May 25 1:56pm
Thank you ðŸ˜Š
May 25 1:56pm
The girls are happy
May 25 1:56pm
I may get a few more while its warm enough for them to be raised outside
May 25 1:57pm
When do they start producing eggs?
May 25 1:58pm
6 months so about Sept
May 25 1:58pm
Cool. How many eggs do they produce over their lifetime?
May 25 1:59pm
About 1 or 2 a day
May 25 1:59pm
You may try raised beds next time
May 25 2:13pm
I got some for gpa

His soil is red clay â€”and Consuelo has a very green thumb
May 25 2:14pm
It gives them something to do so gpa isnâ€™t bored and crotchety
May 25 2:15pm
I had originally thought about going for the beds. If I owned my house, I would.
May 25 2:15pm
They could be moved
May 25 2:15pm
They can, aye.

May 25 2:15pm
Even full though they might be heavy
May 25 2:16pm
Top soil is somewhat cheap ...$1.58 per ft3
May 25 2:16pm
And then a little miracle grow right around the plants
May 25 2:17pm
Aye. We've bought 80 gallons for our porch.
May 25 2:17pm
Those are working out better.
May 25 2:17pm
I used a book case that was falling apart
May 25 2:17pm
It looks good.
May 25 2:17pm
Oh good
May 25 2:17pm
How's [[AG]] and [[UJ]]?
May 25 2:43pm
Everyone enjoying the summer break?
May 25 2:44pm
So far â€”we are all moving slowly but moving nonetheless
May 25 3:16pm
Nice.
May 25 3:16pm
I assume it will pick up. First couple weeks of break are recovery.
May 25 3:17pm
Definitely
