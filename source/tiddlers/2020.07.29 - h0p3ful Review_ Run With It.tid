*[[Game Idea]]
** This is dope. I think <<tag "independent project">>is such a special place in your wiki. Run with it!
*** I hope you will keep an open mind about the "this is mine" authenticity worry. As I have shown you, one does not easily escape the "poisoned origins" problem of autonomy. I think all your work in your wiki is yours, and I can't pick out anything which is "just yours" either (we all rely upon [[others]] to even be ourselves). 
*[[Notage Ti.63]]
** Hrm. It will be valuable to make sure you understand what your commands do on the command line. As you know, it is easy to cause disasters in your system if you don't (and, in my experience, I'll find a way to cause disasters even when I'm doing my best not to cause them). 
** I'm glad to see you trying to fix your computer! Excellent.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** [[Character ten: Necromaster]] could probably use a new title and a tag. =)
** I adore [[2019.07.29 â€“ Prompted Introspection: Growing up.]], "Elder Child," lol!
