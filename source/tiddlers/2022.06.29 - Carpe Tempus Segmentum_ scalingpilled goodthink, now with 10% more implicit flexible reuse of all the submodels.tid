title: 2022.06.29 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: scalingpilled goodthink, now with 10% more implicit flexible reuse of all the submodels

Woke at 6:30? Liet Curran. Meditate. Fireman Time! Hugs'n'bugs for my sympaticon and mi amor. Mi amor is unhappy that she can't find the lids to her cups, an eternal problem, and it throws her morning off. 

[[TTTOTW]]. 

My sympaticon and I spent some time trying to melt and epoxy a ziptie loop fidget (perhaps with multiples or a looped end on the sliding head to allow one to race it around). Neither option has the necessary tensile strength. Leftover breakfast. Plans for her possible future tattoo done by hand, no machine.

[[TTTOTW]]. Assignments. Offspring claim to have set their phone alarms for weekly trash. Chatting with [[anon]]s on [[plebbit|Reddit]] and [[aether|Aether]]. ⁸Δ⁸.

//Skintime// + //Car Talk// with my sympaticon. Thinking about her friend and planning her Pauper/Budget recipe book. Lots of tags to consider. Scaling, tools, time limits, regionality, limiting to common ingredients, ingredient substitution page, budget kitchen equipment set with ranks (picked out by chefs who been homeless and worked at all budget levels), allergies, etc. Might take a decade to perfect something like that (not sure what would be unstable about it).

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

Offspring came down to grind. Discussion about the logical equivalence of all necessary propositions and the implications for [[salience]]. My daughter is working on photos, my son on the information he wishes to present. Need to order another title for The Beast. The digital process is going slower than we'd like, but it's a real world project worth experiencing. #Adulting. {[[Dream]]}ing about a custom [[art]]ist's machine for [[j3d1h]], an expensive task to get right for her, as she wants the host to be Loonix for all the reasons. [[j3d1h]] is now working on concurrency for the archiving program; they are [[sharing]] [[1uxb0x]]'s device for development.

A deep dive with my offspring and sympaticon into paranoid computing ideas.

[[TTTOTW]].

//The Walk// with mi amor. Got her shot. Dope. [[Lauraceae]] received and [[like]]d her gift. Mi amor was hoping it was SAD sapping her own energy, but doesn't feel like that's the case at this point. Still passionate, but tired. SZ is considering taking Greek after seeing mi amor have so much fun with it. Another divinity student going into librarianship because of mi amor. Her students sending her notes. Labyrinth presentation is about ready, and the abstract+intro for her ATLA paper has been written (should fall into place now). Access services panel canceled (good). She was unhappy that SZ will not be recommending the hero-tier of excellence award, though claimed she deserved it (unfortunately, it's the wrong optics and damages SZ's voice); given how the pay structure works, it has no real effect after promotion. It sucks not to be recognized for her excellence. The opening stage of the MDiv/MAR program includes a dumpsterfire forum (lawd). She's in touch with the people who construct the curriculum, as they've got several errors (interesting person to provide them feedback). Thinking about housing and the economy. She hates //Forrest Gump// (move, character, and even the actor) but also agrees to accuracy of my self-[[identification with him|Identifying With: Fictional Characters]]. Plans for the extended weekend she has been gifted. Lots of pictures today, and I can't see orange flowers to save my life. The solar panels look good on [[The Alien Asylum]]'s building from afar.

Searchfu concerns about the pressure cooker for rice with my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]].

[[Family Gathering]] was pleasant. We had Chashuesque BBQ stirfry with rice and green beans. Delicious. Wilson's cancer treatment episode of //House//. Only 3 left. My daughter is ready to be done with it.

Helping my offspring out, reminders of a decade-old problem `/smh`. [[TTTOTW]]. Dialectics with my sympaticon: [[philosophical analysis]]. Dope.

Put mi amor to bed. Pushed brix. [[TTTOTW]].
