title: 2020.05.17 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: The Clutch Minister's Sermon

* Woke at 10
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Inform the Men!
* Meditation
* Shower of the gods!
* Surfed
* [[Family Time]]!
** General discussion of the break. 
*** We spent a good deal of time thinking about what it means to come back from our break. Incentivizing ourselves to take more breaks knowing that we will dive back in from experience. It's a test.
**** Also, yet again, a discussion of the ideal of unschooling. 
** [[TTP]]s: much better than usual.
*** I think we finally have some concept working. I hope it will be smooth sailing for them a year from now.
** 1-on-1's
*** Been a while. At this point, it will probably just be each adult with each offspring. 
** Dialectures
** Daughter showed us another piece of art she made for [[j3d1h: Entity]]
*** One day, she will decide to put a portfolio process together. Until then, I get to see quantum leaps.
*** I think I like her black and white work the most. 
** Reading the wikis...
*** I am not surprised, but I'm disappointed in my son's lack of effort. He knows though. We'll get there.
**** Well, I was surprised by my daughter's [[Antipleonasm Analysis]] and [[Prompted Introspection]] work. 
***** Interesting to see her drop the other lifelog-obvious portions of her [[CDR]]s. 
***** They were good. Some of them real good. Maybe a thousand more of each of those, and aint nobody gonna be able to do what she can. Soon, she'll be putting on a clinic for me. 
****** Now, to help her build pristine articles of many kinds. 
****** Even quietly, may she cut through the world like an alien empress.
*** Lots of discussion about the chatlogs.
** Bratwursts, kraut, pickles, peas, apples. Yum.
** Family Walk in the Dark Woods
*** Offspring took us to the special place. Hilariously past an artificial pond (right on the edges, almost falling in the entire time), to a place with a shovel and what appeared to be buried objects in a field. Nope. Time to go.
*** We planned the midnight graffiti art on the bridge.
**** First, we practice our bailout pathing though. My son and I will be lookouts mostly (though I want us to get some time painting), everyone walkie-talkie'd up.
**** I need to acquire supplies. 
**** I would like it to be super simple in a way. We must draft. 
***** We could construct and maintain an anonymous site (would be important practice). QR Code would do fine.
** [[Family Log]]
