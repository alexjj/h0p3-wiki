title: 2020.09.20 - Family Log: Late

!! Write a paragraph summarizing each person's week:

* [[1uxb0x]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I thought a lot this week. I also recently started a project of my own to write a lot of ideas about games. My project has been very fun. My week was okay, ups and downs. I got okay sleep this week.
** j3d1h
*** Your writing for school was great! I think you should watch out for choppy sentences, but apart from that, it's looking great. Your jokes are absolutely top-notch, comedy gold. You seemed a little happier to me this week, and I'm glad (if you were)! I hope you have even less stress this week.
** k0sh3k
*** I really appreciate the work you did this week! I hope you have more days like the 17th and 18th, where you write a lot. I am super glad you enjoyed engineering more this week! I'm not surprised you liked trains - you were fascinated by trains as a little kid, they were your favorite thing ever. I am glad you are a super-polite guy. We need to get you new pants before it gets too cold, although you really, really, really need to go through your clothes and bag up the stuff that is too small!
** h0p3
*** [[1uxb0x]]'s plebitude grows. He's had a few consoles to use over the years, and I delusionally believed I had succeeded as a father each time I watched him wisely set these plebmachines aside. My hopes have been dashed. Where the fuck did I go wrong? He's been a joy to walk with. He's done better in school work, and that will earn him his laptop. His wiki has been humorous, and I hope we can see it used every day. He's outgrown his pants, again. ~~God damnit~~ It's a good thing he's growing. He has a deeper voice than I do. He's been toting his 2-in-1 everywhere, jotting his secrets down while hiding his eyes with his straw hat. He's got a stool next to his seat in the living room that he uses for his noodles and water. His hair is now 80's rockstar.

** 1uxb0x
*** Thank you for thinking about my ideas with me this week. You also wanted to play SS13, thanks! You've done the bulk of cooking this week, thanks! *insert more and more compliments.* I don't think you slept too well every day, nor did I [Almost said it right there (o_o - o_o)]
** j3d1h
*** I really liked the art I did finish - I'm improving very rapidly, and hopefully I can keep it up. I've been more creative, and even helped Smokey out on something he was making. I liked my CS work quite a bit, too. I'm a mixture of disappointed and amused that h0p3 keeps slipping up in this computer-hacking game. It makes this so much easier, but there's also some anxiety in not knowing whether he messed up intentionally or accidentally.
** k0sh3k
*** I was sad to see no work for me done for the week, but I was glad to see your Prompted Introspections and Life Logs make an appearance, anyway. I hope you write more next week; I know it's easy to give in to being unmotivated, but you have to learn to overcome that and just dig into the work. I have very much enjoyed talking to you about literature - both your class on ancient literature and your reading of Flowers for Algernon.
** h0p3
*** [[j3d1h]] didn't generate proof of work, and thus the trust she has generated has been limited to offline conversations. She's not moving fast enough in her books either, and, sadly, she is starting over in several of them to actually deliver the goods (goddess help us all). She's been drawing more, and her ability to skid her way back onto Discord (and her other garbage tech) despite the softbans has been marginally impressive. She hangs out with losers all day, so she must be a loser. She's a good friend to her friends too. Also, she led the conversation on one of our walks, and her razor sharp tongue delivers finishing blows (beware). Slowly, she has been accepting help in the kitchen. She's had some serious ups and downs this week; it's been tough thinking about the world together. She's been waking up too early.

** 1uxb0x
*** You always sleep badly. It sucks that your stomach is being all annoying. Thank you for correcting my work. Also thank you for sending me that image when I couldn't see it. You've been getting more and more anxious I think.
** j3d1h
*** A complete lack of meetings is a //major// miracle, excuse you. I liked talking about literature with you, too! I should probably read more often, you have some great suggestions. Your RCL topic was, surprisingly, a little different from your sermon last week (at least, I'm pretty sure it was)! The Spice house does look promising, thank you for taking us to check it out.
** k0sh3k
*** This week was house-heavy, for sure. I also worked towards setting half-days for remote work and getting us all scheduled for our flu shots early next month. It was a busy week. I had a lot of fun learning how to use RiseVision software to manage the electronic signage at work. I am tiiiiiired, but still chugging along. I am trying to be not worried about getting a house or renting a place or whatnot; we have time, but I have a hard time not worrying about things.
** h0p3
*** [[k0sh3k]] has dropped some of the pace at work (and may be securing more time at home!), and she's been dealing with trying to buy a house. There's been a lot to think and feel about; it's one of those kinds of moves that requires us to see who we were and who we are going to be with a broad scope. It is this ironic, hypocritical miracle that she is so good at her job (one of logistics, planning, maintenance, cleaning, and bringing order to chaos [[irwartfrr]]) given the rest of her life. She magic. Also, she's been reading and arguing with me about Saint GÃ¶del in contrast to this Oppenheimer human speciperson. She's been watching //Bull//, which is what it sounds like. She generously fed her greedy, sweaty, sweet-toothed hungry husband who clearly couldn't feed himself no matter how hard he tried. She's been feeling the emotions of the world too, and I can see the anxiety in her (on walks, we each sometimes have to take a moment to let it pass). She's been dreaming about a home, and I think that's been one of the better parts of her week (it's not something she would have predicted for herself for much of her life).

* [[h0p3]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I'm growing very, very fast. We don't really talk much, do we? (well, I mean I don't, you on the other hand.) It's odd to think At half my age I couldn't use the terminal, I was 6, geez, time flies now. You devote yourself to your work, you have an unbroken love of reason, philosophy, and annoying everyone around you.
** j3d1h
*** You should never, ever write children's books. No, I don't think I could finish the semester's work //with notes// in a couple days; yeah, I could read a book in 24 hours. You really are a heathen - everything is overcooked or undercooked, except for pasta, with you. I'm glad you kept your wiki //relatively// tame this week. It's interesting that you talk more often when you've met the other IRL. Is that a commitment thing on their part, and they feel more obligated to stay in touch when they "personally" know you, maybe?
** k0sh3k
*** You should never be a children's book author, for real. I think the game you're playing with j3d1h for her computer control is an interesting way to both punish her for not getting her schoolwork done and challenge her to work on her computer skills. You sent some cool links and maymays this week; thank you! I really appreciate all the time you spent with me this week dreaming and thinking about houses, but I also really appreciate your telling me to pack it up and call it day when I got too stressed or was staying up too late worrying about houses.
** h0p3
*** [[h0p3]] has been all over the place this week. It's been quite a week. Thinking about house, weighing the world, thinking about relationships, walking and talking like a madman, and hearing [[Sphygmus]]'s voice for the first time. He didn't all the work done he wanted to get done, but it was enough.
