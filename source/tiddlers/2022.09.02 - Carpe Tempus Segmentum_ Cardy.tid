Woke at 12:30? Phased in and out for a bit. Not real sleep. [[TTTOTW]].

//The Walk// with my sympaticon. Cool. Hard dialectics, soft stories.

Chilled with mi amor. She did sleep, for now, and with extremely vivid dreams. Gonna have to get used to her variable timing coming home. Had a bagel with her.

[[TTTOTW]]. Bed by 7:30?

Woke at 1? Sleep wasn't enough, but it will do. Hugs'n'bugs. [[TTTOTW]].

Met Tracy, our neighbor. She does arbitrage, special collections, and item hunting, especially with tools. Apparently, she is a skilled interwebs researcher, and she will teach me her fu. She put her contact in my phone, and we'll have lemonade or wine to "shoot the shit" as she said. Dope. Her friend is a blacksmith, though I cannot say how skilled or honest (perhaps we'll find out). They knew us, since we walk so much. We're the weirdos (their words, and they are right).

Took my sympaticon to Verizon to get her phone account fixed. I need to hit T-Mobile to get muh interwebs back up on it (calls still work). I wouldn't say the man at the desk was as hospitable as he ought be.

Shopping @ W-Entity with my sympaticon. Picked up noods and moojuice. Saw Marie at the entrace, and she knows our faces. Reminded her of our names (since we don't have badges).

Pulled over to speak with a woman who was crying while walking her bike. Streams of snot began as we approached. Sounds in trouble. Lost her job, not a good situation with her bf. Too overwhelmed and maybe embarrassed to talk. Took my card, said she'd e-mail if she needed help. `/wave`.

Offspring came down to grind. [[5c0ut]] came down to chill for a bit. Home early (well, on time*), thankfully. Meeting with bosses seemed alright. Helping one of his morning staff with some significant problems. Earning "respect" (status*) is not my bailiwick,<<ref "t">> but I appreciate the struggle. Thinking about Stable diffusion and code prediction engines with my offspring. Give my usual talk. Not up to me, of course.

Cleaning. Asking for help with a DHT. I really need people who will think with me on this topic. One asshole, [[ASmith]] at least appreciated the concern, and [[(*crickets*)]] otherwise. `/nod`.

A wild [[guest556]] appears...

//The Walk// with mi amor. Met a feller I've passed many times. William. Daytrader, capitalist, specializes in futures. Grilled him with rapidfire questions for 15 minutes. `/nod`. Called me a "thinker." I hope to. 3 offspring, one military, taking care of his older parents. Many contradictions. Carded. `/wave`. Justin also has been carded. `/wave`. Reggie held us hostage until we took his veggies and paraded around the garden. `/nod`.

Made dinner with mi amor. Burgers. Loaded. Watched LolVods highlights with my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]]. Massage. Sleep by 9? 

Woke at 11. Meditation. [[TTTOTW]].
