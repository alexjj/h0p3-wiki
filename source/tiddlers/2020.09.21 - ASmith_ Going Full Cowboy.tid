"""
[20.09.21 - 19:27:55] [[ASmith]]: Greetings and Monday howdies to [[REDACTED]], how are you's in this pandemic and tense enviroments?
[20.09.21 - 19:28:30] [[h0p3]]: I'm doing surprisingly well.
[20.09.21 - 19:28:41] [[ASmith]]: and how is that h0p3 ?
[20.09.21 - 19:28:56] [[h0p3]]: Food, sex, interwebs, and sleep. 
[20.09.21 - 19:28:57] [[ASmith]]: you have a CBR filtering bunker you are living 24/7 in already?
[20.09.21 - 19:29:09] [[ASmith]]: oh, I see
[20.09.21 - 19:29:10] [[h0p3]]: Nope. Completely unprepped, lol.
[20.09.21 - 19:29:20] [[ASmith]]: um, ok
[20.09.21 - 19:29:27] [[h0p3]]: Trying to find a home though.
[20.09.21 - 19:29:51] [[ASmith]]: do you agree with Sweden going full cowboy, letting the deadly virus run unabaited across their Nation?
[20.09.21 - 19:30:35] [[ASmith]]: Lots of homeless vets, familys, women in my area at this time, likely more than the norm 
[20.09.21 - 19:32:24] [[h0p3]]: I don't agree to allowing it to run unabaited. I appreciate that it might not damage their particular section of the world that much, but I think it has other effects beyond them.
[20.09.21 - 19:33:16] [[ASmith]]: yep, it devistates the minoritys, seniors, and anyone medically compromised or infirmed
[20.09.21 - 19:33:51] [[ASmith]]: however its not children and young teens are uneffected, that is the big lie or very wrong thinking
[20.09.21 - 19:34:45] [[ASmith]]: those infected even if they don't realize it carry long term disease complications for a long time if not for the rest of their lives, heart problems, neurological problems etc. etc. and those are just the few leaking out under heavy censorship in the West
[20.09.21 - 19:34:54] [[h0p3]]: The young have lower mortality rates (in an immediate sense), but the permanent damage of the virus may have strong consequences even for them (and that's only looking at the virus itself). 
[20.09.21 - 19:34:56] [[h0p3]]: Aye.
[20.09.21 - 19:35:53] [[h0p3]]: A lot more hunger, homelessness, lack of education, the remnants of support and trust disintegrate, and this is what I think is the greatest threat to their futures.
[20.09.21 - 19:36:05] [[ASmith]]: perhaps this exposes the utterly satanically evil Zionist Puppet Masters agendas, they are ultra-racist and label minoritys, all blacks, all people of color, the infirmed as undesirable, a burden on their profit taking and war making
[20.09.21 - 19:36:49] [[ASmith]]: of course there's alot of starvation, that is a side effect of #GlobalHeating which the Zionist led Western Nations are ordered by their Zionist Puppet masters to entirely ignore and deny, deny, deny
[20.09.21 - 19:38:05] [[ASmith]]: expanding desertification is a term directly linked now to Global Heating and Global Climate changes yet only a handful understand that term and how deadly that single vector is
[20.09.21 - 19:38:55] [[ASmith]]: the very complex sea chain of life really is at its foundation in the world's coral reefs which are now being killed off by the bleaching effects of bathtub temperature oceans 
[20.09.21 - 19:39:22] [[ASmith]]: the core drilling comparisons need to go back some 34 Million years now for a comparison
[20.09.21 - 19:39:31] [[h0p3]]: I cannot say I understand the effects of it well enough. I predict mass migration and crimes against humanity there though. Already the human body is being pushed to the absolute thermal limit in huge sections of the world.
[20.09.21 - 19:39:45] [[ASmith]]: that is way-way before humans and when huge rain forests were the norm
[20.09.21 - 19:40:39] [[ASmith]]: yes thermal limits on passenger jets taking off on normal sized runways, thermal limits in desert regions for outside activitys, thermal limits in deeper mines
[20.09.21 - 19:41:02] [[ASmith]]: and of course ever shorter potable fresh drinking water supplies as a result
[20.09.21 - 19:42:36] [[ASmith]]: you've watched the sci-fi classic alien movie, 'The Arrival' ? well leaving many Thousands of Methane fracking wells 'uncapped' either deliberate or due to extremely poor Trumpian Republican like regulations has poured deadly raw Methane Gas into the upper atomosphere to push a global heating runaway cycle on earth
[20.09.21 - 19:43:27] [[ASmith]]: in 'The Arrival' have you seen that movie yet? That is precisely how the incoming aliens terraform the earth to their more tolerated temperature range. Its sci-fi but ironic nonetheless
[20.09.21 - 19:45:01] [[ASmith]]: The Arrival 1996 Sci-Fi / Thriller Cast Charlie Sheen, Teri Polo, Richard Schiff and Lindsay Crouse https://yts.mx/movies/the-arrival-1996
[20.09.21 - 19:48:36] [[ASmith]]: Weather forecast for early October is in the 90F area here
[20.09.21 - 19:48:44] [[ASmith]]: #math convert 90 F to C
[20.09.21 - 19:48:44] <TAS_Helpbot> A_Smith: 32.22
[20.09.21 - 19:48:58] [[ASmith]]: 33 C, wow that's in the late fall
[20.09.21 - 19:50:26] [[ASmith]]: did you notice the Hurricane forecasters ran out of regular names and switched to the Greek alphabet, 'Hurricane Beta now to unleash many days of flooding, rainfall, pounding surf from Texas all the way to Louisiana
[20.09.21 - 19:50:46] [[ASmith]]: ok, guess you went to sleep there h0p3 , cya
[20.09.21 - 19:50:57] [[ASmith]]: working on chores, afk
[20.09.21 - 20:22:20] [[h0p3]]: I'm sorry I had to afk. Folks needed help making dinner.
[20.09.21 - 20:22:28] [[h0p3]]: The Arrival is an amazing movie.
[20.09.21 - 20:24:20] [[h0p3]]: Wait, I take it back. I've not seen "The Arrival." I've seen Arrival.
