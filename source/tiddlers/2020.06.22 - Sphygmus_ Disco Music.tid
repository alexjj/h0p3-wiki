[12:48 AM] robotic_scarab: `I'm especially taken by the //Explosions in the Sky//`
big ups! I have them in one of my "listen to in the car" playlists and they're great :happiness:
[1:00 AM] robotic_scarab: I've been listening to this album (https://mosessumney.bandcamp.com/) straight through -- it's a soundscape, and also really reminds of me of Disco: Elysium in several ways
[1:15 AM] h0p3: I like Colouour the most so far.
[1:15 AM] h0p3: How'd you like Disco: Elysium?
[1:18 AM] h0p3: I've not finished it. Not sure if I will be able to.
[1:18 AM] robotic_scarab: when I finished the game, I was annoyed with the overall plot/storyline slash it didn't really resonate with me (maybe I'm just not the right age / gender :bflushed: ), but
`the specific writing is wonderful; hilarious, meta at times, vulnerable at times, reactive and woven together â€“ it's easily the best part of the whole game.`
[1:19 AM] robotic_scarab: what would prevent you from finishing?
[1:19 AM] h0p3: aye =), best part of our conversations is that we get to search each other's wikis while talking (usually I'm searching the web)
[1:19 AM] h0p3: I'm not convinced it is worth my time to finish it.
[1:20 AM] robotic_scarab: hm
[1:20 AM] robotic_scarab: I think one of the most powerful scenes I got was only because I did a specific sidequest because I was a completionist
[1:21 AM] robotic_scarab: (and I soooorta knew it was coming, but it was very very strong anyway; I believe that was one of the one or two moments the game made me cry)
[1:22 AM] robotic_scarab: so I would say it's worth making it through to that scene, if you did the requirements, but the main questline ... I'm much more ehh on
[1:26 AM] h0p3: It seems like a game that could have significant replay value. I don't know enough about the structure of the game to know if it would have that much variation in the kinds of stories it could tell in the end.
[1:27 AM] h0p3: I think I have a hardened heart for such games. My goal has always been to bypass as much of the story as possible to find the inner mechanics that mattered to me, lol. That misses the point of this game.
[1:28 AM] robotic_scarab: heh yeah, it does miss the point of this game! :sweat_smile:
[1:28 AM] h0p3: I should keep trying. I like having stories as commonground references.
[1:29 AM] robotic_scarab: I did start at least one replay of the game, but the major choices ... don't really change. it's much more about the individual moments again, and how they may or may not shift your perceptions of the characters etc
[1:30 AM] robotic_scarab: if you do keep trying, I would recommend following the cryptid story line as much as possible!
