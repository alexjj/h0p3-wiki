title: 2020.07.04 - Prompted Introspection: Discourse As Ritual

!! Describe one of the family traditions you practice.

[[2019.06.24 - Prompted Introspection: Family Tradition]] is still the most important ritualized tradition we have. It's hard work, but we are ultimately glad to do it. It continues to evolve for us.

Another tradition in our family is discourse, dialectures, debate, and various kinds of argumentation. I'm a tunnel-visioned blindman toward what is [[salient]], and they pay the price in interacting with me. [[Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση]] presentations, fleshing out specs/requirements for our CS projects, [[hyperconversation]]s in [[h0p3ful Review]], a non-trivial {[[focus]]} on our remote communications infrastructures, the way we infuriatingly pause during videos to discuss, and perhaps the recently added [[Debatable]] are examples.

We employ [[Family: Battle Language]] gestures for control-flow and exercising our autonomy together. Sometimes shit gets real, we stand in the pocket trading blows, and as long as all obligations are met, we can express any feeling we wish. Most of the time, we are telling and interpreting the stories of ourselves and the world together as best we can. Of course, we must derp and maymay, and my farts are legendary. I wouldn't have it any other way.
