title: 2021.10.04 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Skincrawling

<<<
Woke at midnight. [[ASK]]ing. Eventually, a [[vidya]] tour of [[The Alien Asylum]]. Our first time in voice. Oh, found out we have a mouse in the basement insulation. [[TTTOTW]] while sitting there on the voice, and it was pleasant. 8 hour conversation, and put her to bed. Lol. Good god. [[TTTOTW]]. AFireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

She's up. XOXOs until I ought not. Wearing that red/black/white geometric patterned dress with her black combat boots. [[TTTOTW]].

Dadnap. She came down for //Skintime//. //Inform the Men//! It's been a good day. Meditation. Shower of the gods! More //Skintime//! She fell asleep in my arms. She woke. Cleaning. 

[[Family Time]]. A bit of chat with [[DeathOfRobinhood]] during, and I think [[j3d1h]] is gonna connect finally. `/thumbs-up`. [[ASK]] joined us some as well. Far more balanced amounts of text to read. A [[Root User]] invoked their privilege. I've been asked to step up with one more [[CDR]] to round out the minimum. 

//Star Trek V: The Final Frontier// + //Skintime//. I can't even stay awake after the cliff scene. Out by 7?

Woke at 11:30? [[ASK]]ing. Surviving. Some expensive contradictions. Painful. [[TTTOTW]].
<<<

I am crawling out of my skin, and it's not stopping. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]] + Pot pies + footbath + LPL Regionals<<ref "l">> (2 more days until worlds). Hard to watch, of course, we still see this building toward Taiwanese war (which, of course, is dumb on all fronts, even my own thoughts); put on a happy face. Also, been eyeing that //Dune// cam for over a week (soundtrack is for soundscape retards only, so leave it on repeat, <3). The urge to consume is consuming me. I can't believe I'm excited to see a movie. I'm not sure if I should show them the original (which is dear to my heart). Probably not. Just wait. Prep for dinner.

Sleep by 4? Woke at 7:30ish? Ugh. Crawling out of my skin. I might have a systemic infection coming. We'll see if I break out. [[ASK]]ing. She survives on 2-3 hours for a week at a time. A mix of signals in her environment, analyzed and named into oblivion, ones she knows better than most humans could. She really does know why she's here: to [[love]]. She is seeking asylum, and she really does seek the best of [[the other]]. She's broken into transcendence, with sprankles of [[stoic]]ly positive nihilism that fight for what matters, and lawd, do she know Sir [[DeathOfRobinhood]]'s will to dance. I am stuck thousands of miles away, unable to help well enough. I am an ear and a mouth, a comparison point, and a source of [[hope]], at best, [[WINTCIS]]. There are very few humans I've ever F5ed many times a day.<<ref "mb">> It's my honor.

Hugs'n'bugs. My son is happy to have me in the room, my daughter not (I know why). As you wish.

I found out she's gonna be gone until almost bedtime for her safe church seminar `/sigh`; I get it, okay. I won't have her tonight. I'm a big boi. I can do this. `/sigh`. Maybe I'll get drunk. I'm glad I enjoy the basement. Vapelyfe (rather do this shit than drink). [[TTTOTW]]. Continue to attempt to connect with Sir Troglodyte. Ranga needs attention. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! Cleaning. Footbath. [[TTTOTW]].

//The Walk// with my offspring. My daughter's bad attitude today makes sense. No fun walking with me when you feel like you're justified in not doing your schoolwork but can't argue for it. I took the reins of the conversations after she agreed she had no intention of answering even the most simple of questions or engaging in [[good]] [[faith]] (her words).<<ref "s">> I know. I will continue to build my proof against you then. So be it. You're on my time now. We walked through instrumentality and vocation (their mother as our muse), reasoning about our teleology, privilege and responsibility, [[Positive Disintegration]] and Saint Kierkegaard's<<ref "i">> Daseinic modes of normativity (a one-to-one mirror mapping onto the dialectical relationship of [[Beautiful]], [[Right]], and [[Good]]). The argument was clear enough, and my son agreed to the conclusion within the first five minutes (no one's first rodeo here).

They didn't need much help with dinner. It was made very early because she's only got a bit over an hour with us tonight. Dadnap. She woke me with brief //Skintime//. Ugh. Crawling is gone. That's it: the Hoth system. Of course.

[[Family Gathering]] was dope. We almost ate upstairs (the weather is getting better). We had roasted potatoes (I don't see the point to wedges; these are better), brats, kraut, finely cut onions (thank you), on wheat, with sprouts too. Fizzy water. I smashed it. Then: //Skintime// while we watched the TB Doc episode of //House//, and the ad hoc arguments against ~~effective~~ altruism are something I'll need to cover with my offspring sometime soon. 

I was tired. And, no reason to get drunk. Just sleep through it.

Woke at 10. Just missed her (and I have no idea why she is still up). Flash upstairs. We played with the cat while she told me about her day. It's a stupid busy one. Compressing a 30 page paper down to a 5, failed after toiling, and then realized that the application demands anyone who has been out of school for as long as she has to write one from scratch given prompts. We have disagreement on the prompts, but now I see that her current labyrinth work is perfect, especially as one of the all-stars she's crushing on talked to her today about it (yes, she is quite engaging isn't she...all yours homie, I just want to watch). Class was affirming, 99, because she missed part of the easiest question (with giggles).<<ref "g">> Meetings went fine. She's still looking for a mental health day. I like that she enjoys her work so much; that vocational [[awe]] do so much for her, yeah [[itdo]]. Her nightclass was nothing she didn't already know from decades of social work, but certs are certs. 

Chat with [[JRE]]. He sent me an incredibly sexually charged image of a girl covered in giant slimy snails, crawling all over her. It's a work of art. I want it. [[ASK]]ing. She slept, with some REM too. A switch in her over 5 hours though,  maybe. Hrm. Disconcerting last messages. I'd be going insane in her shoes too, if I even made it that far. 

[[TTTOTW]].

[[ASK]] is alright. Miscommunication.
