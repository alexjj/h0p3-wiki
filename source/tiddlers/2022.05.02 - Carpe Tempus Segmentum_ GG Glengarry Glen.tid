Set meeting up with [[5c0ut]]. //Skintime// with my sympaticon. Sleep by 1?

Woke at 8? //Skintime// with my sympaticon. [[Morning Routine]]. [[TTTOTW]]. [[D2]] science. Trying something new out. +3 Blizz Ormus robes in the old wardrobe, and decided to see if we can push even harder. Got our runs down to 6:30 with maximum {[[Focus]]}. [[TTTOTW]].

//The Walk// with mi amor.

Watering in the [[garden]]. We have flowers in the yard. The tree we planted last year, it has one flower too. [[TTTOTW]].

[[5c0ut]] prepared a date meal for Dev, and left us a ton of Indian food. It was dope.

Ate food and began [[Family Time]] @ 3? Vapelyfe. Simple. Eventually, we watched the second to last //Sherlock//. Unfortunately, the fucker lives, so we have to watch more of it. 

//The Walk// with my sympaticon. Chat with [[DeathOfRobinhood]].

Cookies. Mi amor and [[j3d1h]] baked cookies for the students tomorrow. They turned out really good. Fluffy and crispy, and limited allergens. Mi amor felt unhappy and discouraged because some got burned, but we liked them a lot. I almost [[hope]] the students choose to eat fruit or something else instead. Chat with [[DeathOfRobinhood]].

[[D2]] testing. The Poison Nova build is simply better. Nova is dope, what can I say? Didn't think I had the gear for it (never even seen that wand; after my time though). The minions don't deal nearly as much damage, nor can they tank as effectively. Given Lower Resist's value now, Lightning (or Fire) is preferred to Cold (masteries that scale). We're at a point where I should be making minions (and can do so quickly) as [[ASK]] hits the throne. We had a 4:45 run, and we're still adjusting. Baal is still slow AF, though perhaps we should stick to LR for the last 40%. Once I have Enigma, she could play anything. Assassin would be a fine pairing. 

//Altered Carbon// + Leftovers + Water + [[TTTOTW]].

Woke at 9:30? Meditation. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. [[5c0ut]] had some good news about a step with Dev. <3.

My sympaticon is not having a good day today. //Skintime//, writing, and then we did a Baal run. Seemed somewhat better after that.

Watched //Glengarry Glen Ross// together downstairs. We hated it, of course. It's not supposed to be something one enjoys like IASIP. The repetitive, maybe banal, nearly meaningless language woven with cusswords, disintegrating shells of human beings, unending exploitation, and shitting on each other the entire time made it hard to bear. For all the supposed drama, there was so much monotony too (there are many contradictions in this piece); the characters seem too much like each other, and, of course, we are thoroughly convinced that the social practices that evolve in capitalism are quite evil. We were left unsatisfied but not [[hope]]less (the world doesn't have to be like this at all), and that is surely the point.

[[Anon]] from SunPower came for taking pictures with measurements of our rafter, roof, and electric panel. He travels all over the state every day, lots of podcasts and some audiobooks. [[Stoic]]ism (this is the second person in his industry I've met in just a few weeks who are caught up in it) and Aurelius has been on his brain. Carded. 

[[TTTOTW]]. [[MTG]] game with my sympaticon. Gobbos +1/0 vs my MWC. Didn't control my land, and I stabilized after humility, sweep, and pulsing (barely made it). Lackey connects are nasty.

[[Family Gathering]] was delicious. We had pizza and garlic bread. Watched the //House// episode where Cuddy's Mother is sick.

//The Venture Bros.// with my sympaticon. Fell asleep during the first episode (probably 9:30?), which is what the show does for me (thank goodness).
