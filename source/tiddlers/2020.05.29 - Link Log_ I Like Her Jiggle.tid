* Think About It
** https://sociable.co/social-media/censorship-destroys-diversity-meant-protect-former-nsa-foreign-surveillance-agent/
*** Not that we should listen to spooks without interrogating them, ofc. It's crucial that people distinguish moderation from censorship. I suppose censorship is preventing those who would want to engage information from doing so. We have at the same time a duty to separate the wheat from the chaff, selecting the salience, while also having a duty to build infrastructures for our enemies (and hosting them, like any memetic hospitalians).
** https://www.reddit.com/r/lostgeneration/comments/grlt1a/conversations_with_boomers_are_at_best/
*** I don't have any boomers in my life that can hold a significant two-sided conversation with me (though, I'm a monster). I've met some geniuses in my time, and I'm pretty fucking disappointed. I am not the measure here. Thus, `/toast` to the vanishing percentage of Boomers who, along with some [[other]] humans, make my life worth living. You shine from the literal garbage I would burn if I could do so without any mistakes (which I can't for so many reasons).
