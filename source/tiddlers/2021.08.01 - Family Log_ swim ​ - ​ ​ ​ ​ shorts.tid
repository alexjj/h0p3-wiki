** So much pain... My neck and shoulders are not getting better. :(

* 1uxb0x
** This week, I was sleepy and didn't just die.
** You've been developing a sense of style (now, you've long known what I think about the pursuit of this at the expense of what matters more*, obv), and it's cool. I'm glad that you take an interest in it. 
** Thank you for making dinner for the family solo and as a team this week. 
** I appreciate your balance of keeping space and showing affection.
** I enjoyed going shopping with you, even though the store didn't have what we were looking for; it's fun hanging out with you.
* j3d1h
** I'm pretty good at changing my speech to suit different people's needs.
** You are skilled at teasing people in a sensible way. It's an art.
** Shit went wrong while making your sauce, and you adapted. `/high-5`.
** I like discussing church sermons with you; you have good thoughts and we end up with good conversations. 
** As your mother points out, you are sometimes very dominant in your speech patterns and overwriting other people's words. 
*** I hope your subs sing praise and worship music to you, with bagpipes.
** 
* k0sh3k
** I took the day off when I needed to and didn't push myself when I shouldn't have. 
*** <3
** I liked going shopping with you, even if we couldn't find any `swim  -     shorts` that fit.
** You've been crafting a wonderful yard. It's totally different from E-Town. It's useful and pretty (hard to beat).
*** I like how you use nature against itself.
** You're petty, but only when it's funny.
* h0p3
** I can talk about anything with anyone, or at least I try.
** Your conversations with others make me laugh, and I like to laugh. 
***Also, I enjoy the fact that I can say terrible things about you to you and you like it, you weirdo. 
**** Yes, [[Miss Direction]]. Thank you.
** You have one helluva sense of humor.
** You have fantastic taste in birthday foods.
* 5c0ut
** You are honest about your bodily functions with us. I like that we get to be mammals together.
** I like that it's easy to make you laugh; it makes me feel better about my sense of humor. 
** It's neat to hear you talk about the place where we'll shop.
** You're pretty easy to casually share media with.
