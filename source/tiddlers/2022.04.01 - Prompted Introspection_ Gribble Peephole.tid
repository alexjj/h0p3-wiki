title: 2022.04.01 - Prompted Introspection: Gribble Peephole

!! Look outside a window in your home. Write down what you see.

I'm looking through the Dale Gribble Peephole down here in muh basement. I keep my windows shielded from the aliens^^tm^^, ofc. I have to hold myself low on my desk to even see around the curtain (though I can makeout vague shadowy silhouettes through the curtain), and ([{they}]) can't see muh keyboard at all (though I am aware of tools that could still capture what I'm typing from right outside my window). You'd still know I'm here though (however, I'd likely know you're there). 

I see just a sliver of my neighbor's home. I'm thinking of Jessica Rabbit, the berry bushes, worried about the little girl, doubtful our families will ever connect, oh, and bricks, I think. The faraday metal screen and my poor eyesight don't help here. The other window has an AC unit with ghetto insulation (I aint movin' it). The remaining crawlspace sized window down here is covered in plexiglass and taped up, it's the exhaust port for our dryer. I should probably do some work on that one.

I like the inside of [[The Den]] more than what is outside it. Maybe that will change as we [[garden]].
