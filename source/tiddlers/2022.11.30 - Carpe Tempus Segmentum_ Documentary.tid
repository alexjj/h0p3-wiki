title: 2022.11.30 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Documentary

Woke at 5:30. Morning time with mi amor. Made coffee together. I enjoy peeing in front of her. Bill for oil is $1k. Prices continue to climb for energy. 

A bit of time with [[5c0ut]]. Everyone has had the shits lately. Not enough sleep. Staying home today. Good. Thanked him for the soup again. 

Soup + //Empire of Dust//

[[TTTOTW]]. Laundry. Fireman Time! Assignments. Leftover pasta + [[TTTOTW]] + //American Factory//. Attempted dadnap. My sympaticon found a leak. We did as we were told, and presumably there was still too much pressure built up. Probably leaking a gallon an hour. Called oil company up again. Upon more examination, the hot water boiler seems to be fine, but the water system for heating the house is relatively cool and with seemingly limit pressure when I bled the radiators upstairs. I feel no heat on its piping. That seems wrong to me. The pressure release catch did its job. Nm. We do have heat. Dave the Capitalist came, and he agrees the failure of the IoT is on him (though has convinced me that it's still worth keeping the IoT up); and, I'm not convinced that the spring-release valve that must be replaced is his cost to bear after listening to his explanation (that may be far too charitable*). Need to stay below 30 PSI, preferably under 25, 20 being best.

Dave walked me through the changes he made. He added an extra bend to limit sediment from catching, and the new valve is cool. He's doing a kind of pipefitting I've never seen, crimping it on. He left his Rigid tool for it, so I'll drop that off later. I like this compression method over brazing (which is also something I've never done, but I've read about it). He verified what I said about the IoT with the company he pays for the service, and we tried it again. He's going to be checking that report now; and I think he probably needs some automation to send him a notification instead. Need to bleed radiators again for the possible gas pocket built next to the upper tank.

Mi amor called. Busy day. Good news is that we will be able to see a dentist and optometrist. Wow. Cool.

Laundry. [[TTTOTW]]. Prepped some dinner with my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]]. Reading [[2022.11.29 - Anonymous: Casting Nets Onto Nets]] with mi amor.

[[Family Gathering]]. Pulled pork, with slaw, broccoli with noodles, and water too. //Mr. Robot//. Cleaning files.

Mi amor thought about the conversation with [[yvyfyf]]. Still listening. [[TTTOTW]]. Finishing off a round on [[The Library]]. Continued //American Factory//. Sleep by 11.
