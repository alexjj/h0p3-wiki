Joke is dope. I wholeheartedly agree that some of the pages (there's thousands) are terrible about this. Funny enough, I have always wanted to actually finish reading the dictionary, and the same for several encyclopedias. I regret that I have not developed the required discipline.

‚Äã @Pastafari  I can appreciate why one might believe this. You are not the first to make that claim or feel that way by any stretch (and previous conversations about this topic with [[others]] can be found in the ‚Ñçùï™ùï°ùïñùï£ùî±ùî¢ùîµùî±). I'm not sure what to make of it. I think even a cursory exploration of the document demonstrates a human wrote it (including by going back through the nightly snapshots), especially if you have more some practice with tools like GPT-3. I think it's interesting and cool that it can appear that way though. I don't know what that implies well enough.

‚Äã @Rodrigo Vaz  Are you certain? :P. There's some reasons to think you've not seen texts all that similar to it (might take a few hours of wandering it to know that).

I'm exceptionally sorry to hear that Google is censoring. I consider it a crime against [[Humanity]] in this case. It is a great danger to us to lose our voices to capitalists who shape the narrative in a 1984esque manner.

I can't lie. When Muta was skipping over those huge paragraphs in the first website with the ranting guy, I paused to keep reading whatever that guy typed into his website.

That's art.

Hrm. Well, I appreciate that you are being honest, and I appreciate that you took the time to read the words (even those that were skipped). I'm not trying to waste your time though, and those pages in this video aren't so representative of my usual writing-style (the work is much, much larger than Muta realizes). Thank you for picking it out as art. You might find it worth exploring for a while to develop a better understanding. You can find it here: https://philosopher.life/.

That is a great question, adam. Hi, I'm h0p3 (from https://philosopher.life). I will agree that perhaps technically skilled people are more likely to have schizo aspects than the general population. Schizophrenia is a problem in our top-down modeling of the world inaccurately overriding our sensations (like a hallucination). There might reasons that such connection-making would be useful to a heavy computer user.
