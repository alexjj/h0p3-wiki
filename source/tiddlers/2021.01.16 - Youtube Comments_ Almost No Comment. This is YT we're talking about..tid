Joke is dope. I wholeheartedly agree that some of the pages (there's thousands) are terrible about this.

​ @Pastafari  I can appreciate why one might believe this. You are not the first to make that claim or feel that way by any stretch (and previous conversations about this topic with [[others]] can be found in the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱). I'm not sure what to make of it. I think even a cursory exploration of the document demonstrates a human wrote it (including by going back through the nightly snapshots), especially if you have more some practice with tools like GPT-3. I think it's interesting and cool that it can appear that way though. I don't know what that implies well enough.

@h0p3 the Philosopher I'm more like 90% certain. There's some posts on 4chan and reddit that have the same crazy nonsensical structure, and it turned out to be AI generated.

I hear ya. Although, that [[/b/]] page is not a call to war with 4chan. Also, I've seen no difference (even 4chan has nothing on it that I can find about this video). I can be contacted, but usually I'm the one who goes out into the world to speak with people (they rarely speak with me).

I'm exceptionally sorry to hear that Google is censoring. I consider it a crime against [[Humanity]] in this case. It is a great danger to us to lose our voices to capitalists who shape the narrative in a 1984esque manner.

I can't lie. When Muta was skipping over those huge paragraphs in the first website with the ranting guy, I paused to keep reading whatever that guy typed into his website. This dude just keeps pulling out his thesaurus in every paragraph. He's wasting time intentionally just to get you pissed off with him.

That's art.

Hrm. Well, I appreciate that you are being honest, and I appreciate that you took the time to read the words (even those that were skipped). I'm not trying to waste your time though, and those pages in this video aren't so representative of my usual writing-style (the work is much, much larger than Muta realizes). Thank you for picking it out as art. You might find it worth exploring for a while to develop a better understanding. You can find it here: https://philosopher.life/.

That is a great question, adam. Hi, I'm h0p3 (from https://philosopher.life). I will agree that perhaps technically skilled people are more likely to have schizo aspects than the general population. Schizophrenia is a problem in our top-down modeling of the world inaccurately overriding our sensations (like a hallucination). There might reasons that such connection-making would be useful to a heavy computer user.
