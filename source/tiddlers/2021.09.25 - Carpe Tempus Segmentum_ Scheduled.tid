title: 2021.09.25 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Scheduled

[[TTTOTW]]. Malfunctions on [[m16]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Attempted sleep by I don't know. It never came. `/sigh`. [[TTTOTW]].

Jumped into bed with her. She had enough sleep, just pretending to be awake. I know the difference. You see: when she's sleeping, it's with an abandon, with more drool and snoring. To have actually woken her up, she will be scared or grumpy. A neutral response was an anticipation: someone had time to think about it. This might be the last month she sleeps naked before it's too cold and she feels compelled to wear jammies (which, at this point, I consider a grave sin). She was totally down for shopping early, thankfully. Without sleep, there's no way I could do it in evening.

Shopping @ Costco. Picked up 50-100 lunches for her (depending), and I think these will be useful for the calorie count and for those mornings where she'd rather not have to prepare anything. Low anxiety shopping day. More a stroll than anything. Prices are going up. Their new self-checkout blows. Had our hotdogs. More thinking about a chapter or two for the book with SZ, and now she has three people saying that she has 4 years to prepare to take over (as SZ's health may be much worse than we knew). More discussion about a bureaucracy that is older than the federal government. Her sweater has changed her eye color to a bright grey. I don't remember our conversations. Fuck. I know that when the topics come again, we'll pick it back up roughly where we left it before though. My brain is dying, I think.

Decided not to hit home first. We can hit both in one swoop.

Shopping @ Aldi. Just one cart today. Produce is simplifying. The harvest is over. Tremendous thighs all over the place. It is my opinion that the average Aldi shopper is hawter than W-Entity and Costco. That car fits more than it looks like it should. 

[[Indieweb]] meetup. I was a couple minutes late, =/. As usual, people were patient with the retard in their midst. I said very little, except Angelo's discussion merited my gibberish. So many people indirectly searching for purpose, and they aren't really interested in wrestling about the topic all the way down. I feel quite distant from these people. Interesting running into a librarian who uses TW; you have my attention. 3.5 hours away. Cajun cheese curds and water. Saw [[MJos]], looking thinner than I remember, but he wasn't able to stay long, I think. I probably won't attend again. If it's just a place to say what I think, well, I already have that. If people want to speak directly to what I have to say, then it may be more valuable for me to be there. It's a brainstorm session, and I appreciate that. I didn't actually learn much of anything. `/shrug`.

Sleep by 4:30. I realize people need to do laundry, and I'm [[grateful]] they just let me sleep. I really wanted to go with her to the W-Entity, but it's okay. I'm glad we had our date last night since I only got a couple hours with her today (so greedy, it wasn't enough; it never is!).<<ref "i">>

Woke at 10. Thank god. That hit. [[ASK]]ing. They slept again, a reprieve of stability, and they've been busy preparing everything. A discussion of naming (which, I think will be a classic, root topic for us). They've got armor and helmet again, and they are far more organized than I am. Bags being packed. I think they are making their last connections with places and people. Those of us who have moved so many times know this surreal feeling, and perhaps it's a ritual we prepare ourselves with. Grief with a mix of hope. 

[[TTTOTW]] + Footbath. I discovered something crucial about my manletude: I'm 4'20". Nice.<<ref "e">>
