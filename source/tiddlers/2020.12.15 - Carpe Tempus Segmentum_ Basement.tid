title: 2020.12.15 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Basement

[[AIR]] is going to move up here with us. Excellent. I think there will be far more opportunity for him up here. 

* Worked in the kitchen as quietly as I could.
** Hit lots of little things, stuff I wouldn't have concerned myself with normally. It's nice to care about it.
** It's almost ready. I need the potrack, and then I can finish the bottom cabinets. Trash/recycling, and then cats, knives, and that's it. 
*** There's going to be a lot of extra room.
** New strategies on our utensils. Will need to walk my offspring through it.
*** Also, new strat on the stove area: it will remain absolutely blank to avoid splash problems. Having contained my wife's mess in the other corner is going to help. 
** Kitchen is in as good of shape as the bathroom now. 
** I adore my kitchen. It's practically zen. 
*** I've several weeks of work to get the rest of house anywhere near as good.
* Fireman Time!
** Saving bookmarked pr0n [[vidya]]s, having to scour. Hundreds of millions of voices cried out as IP conventions have coincidentally been followed overnight.
* Read+Write
* Sleep at 5
* Woke at 11
** Vivid dreams. I know people in my dreams.
*** Like I could wake up, but why?
* [[Morning Routine]]
* First words my daughter said to me: Ranga has not been seen. Ugh. 
** He does this from time to time. Back in New Orleans, JC, and perhaps here too. 
*** I know my wife is distraught that he's gone forever. Even though he's a smart cat who can take dogs just fine, he's got plenty of fat and fur on him, he knows his way around outdoors, and he's highly skilled at getting any human to pet or feed him (usually has multiple neighbors who bring him treats and have their own names for him): it's not a worry or a pain that is going to go away. =(. 
* [[MTG]]
** Son continues to develop his deck with the restricted and staple vintage cards. I'm glad to see the [[power]] bug in him. May standard, the usual casual magic, etc. never have any allure to him. The real [[beauty]] is in finding the edges, and why not in the most beautiful deck in all of magic? Pure reaction.
** Lost an unsided match to him 1-2, +1, +0, +0. He picked Affinity for me. B2B is demolishing, even through leaf+mox+clamp hax. Homefry is locking me down hard. He got to see real combo math. I think he's liking those FoWs, and he's getting better at spending his permission resources (getting harder to bait him). It makes all the difference. I mean, adding a few thousand dollars of cards to the deck helps too, but he's pushing the correct direction.
* Thought about my wife's day with her. 
** They are handing everyone a free meal. The gestures that let us know they really care, ofc.
*** She does have a much higher percentage of care^^tm^^ around her than I'm used to seeing, though none will stand up to scrutiny. 
** More neolib intersection without class argumentation out of the group. I think she plays right into it at times (and, that's because the arguments are often bikeshed valid even if virtue signal misdirective); I continue to buffer. 
*** J is an easy strawman of garbage to otherize (get on my level, losers: otherize everyone).
** I like how she pushes back against S directly. My suggestion is continue to develop a policy around him. His misinformation and mistakes are not accidents: they are chaotic climbing tools, and it requires containment. His mistakes can easily become ours in appearance.
** She is a woman of infinite patience. She tells it like it is, and she picks out what is [[salient]] with depth, accuracy, and consistency. I like the masculine aspects of my wife too. In the end, her outspoken eclectic ace androgyny is part of our bridge of sensibilities.
* The Basement
** {[[Focus]]} has been on public living spaces first. Basement counts, and it has to be ready for our oil specialist. The inspector was there to help sell the house; I assume the specialist will be there to sell me something else.
** This is like a second first-pass (after the washer debacle). 
** We have so much trash build-up. Spoiled by a dumpster before. It's going to take a couple weeks to get rid of it. 
*** I don't know how much time we have before [[AIR]] comes up. That could be this week for all I know (though I think longer).
**** I want to give him immediate options. 
** My room is a bit more put together. It was probably the first room that had any function, but it may be the last one to get finished. It is a hikicave after all. What more could I ask for than a mattress, a desk, a walking path?
** Found the missing kitchen boxes. Still might be one missing from the feel of it. 
* Shopping
** I hate having to go out anyway, but doubly so with CV19. Shit continues to heat up.
** Opportunity for offspring to shop and build [[phenomenological]] horizons here. We spent half an hour getting there, might as well spend another half an hour exploring a bit more. We don't do it often, and they need to feel comfortable traversing. Plus, we're trying to get their rooms done.
** Harbor Freight
*** Display had stick, box right below looked the same, but it's flux (not discovered until we got home). Ugh. Come to think of it though, I probably want both in the end. Sometimes, I just want to empty material into the void to get the job done (not like I'm working on heavy-duty equipment or pipe where high quality welds matter to me). Let's go for both. 
**** Need to show my son how to prep the area. Going to be in-place. If he likes it, maybe it's a class we could do. I can't teach them TIG (we could learn, but the equipment is too much), but we can get the job done even if it won't look like the mona lisa (and we don't own any expensive metal). 
***** Better done in a real shop though, and I would be worried about teaching them any bad habits. Still, some exposure is better than none in this case.
** Checked out Big Lots (they've never been in one, and we talked about what they were) and a Thrift store
*** I would like to have nice fully comfortable couches some day. 
*** Everything is insanely expensive up here. Neither were particularly budget oriented.
**** My daughter said I'm one stingy motherfucker, lol.
*** We had fun playing in the thrift store. I think the aesthetic experience of finding treasure among trash and having stories to go along with the purchase is a premium people pay for. It wasn't about actual thriftiness, it was about style and mere storytelling ([[gfwiwcgws]]).
** GJS license plate, quasi-RP. 
** W-Entity
*** It was an absolute madhouse. People are prepping for the storm. This is an area that sometimes goes without power during ice storms. 
*** Picked up shovels and salt to fulfill our end of the bargain. My offspring are in for a real treat, no doubt. 
**** My daughter said she was excited, lol. Maybe. She has little experience with snow.
*** Didn't see nametag on cashier, but she was a lifer from the feel of it. Bitter today too, understandably. I continue to ask what is the norm around here since I do not know. I will be an alien for a long time, I take it (probably always). 
* My wife's migraine and period hit. On top of Ranga missing, I think it's fair to call it a bad day for her. =/.
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Chicken, potato salads, fruit, water
** Offspring played [[magic]]. Son stabilized with ACall, Drain still in hand, lol. Eventually, that matchup may switch to +1 Affinity's favor. 
* //Skintime//, and she put me to sleep this round. 
* Woke up at 11:40 in a ball of sweat.
** Extremely vivid chase sequences, but this time with people I knew coming with me (pretty rare for there to be anyone to be chased alongside me too). We had fun even while being chased. Heart-pounding still.
