title: 2022.01.09 - Waldo_After_Dark: Tribute to ASmith

"""
01:35:03 AM ​[[Waldo_After_Dark]]: Hello, you know the part of me that refuses to grow up is kinda disappointed that you don't use an ascii image of Agent Smith in your user info ASmith.
02:02:38 AM [[h0p3]]: Perhaps this will serve as a [[Text Art]] image of Sir [[ASmith]]: https://philosopher.life/#ASmith
02:40:43 AM ​[[Waldo_After_Dark]]:  Thanks that does nicely. I can see I don't need to make one now, lol.
01:33:10 PM [[ASmith]]: A Smith, as in any smith, however thanks for the tribute h0p3, and thoughts in that regard Waldo_After_Dark
01:37:44 PM [[ASmith]]: I prefer this one myself https://tascloud.me/index.php/s/HGfk7sQtxm7xAqq
04:11:59 PM [[h0p3]]: I like that one more too. `/bow`.
07:40:14 PM ​[[Waldo_After_Dark]]: I do think that one is more fitting now that I have the proper meaning.

[22:10:15] ASmith: Hi, do you enjoy listening to Gregorian Chants, I'm listening to 2 that you might want to do that same if you want?
[22:10:49] h0p3: Hell yeah. Send it my way. I'm heading out right now, but I will definitely listen. I like those a lot.
[22:10:59] h0p3: Thank you for thinking of me.
[22:12:13] ASmith: of course, I refound a folder where I had saved several gregorian chants which I found really nice
[2 +125mb mp3s uploaded]
[22:17:14] ASmith: I'll add the folder 'Gregorian Chants' to my DarkMX shares also now
