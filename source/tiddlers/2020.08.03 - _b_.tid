University Bundle Deal Buys You:

* lectures and assignments.
* schedules and deadlines that discourage procrastination, if you're the sort of person who leaves things until the last minute.
* You (hopefully) get detailed feedback on assignments from a real human.
* big manicured lawns and marble pillars.
* health insurance.
* in-person small-group discussions (at least in some subjects) of advanced topics.
* a bunch of people of your age and social background, all uprooted from home and looking to make new friends at the same time.
* subsidised gyms and sports clubs and interest clubs.
* to network and meet people.
* buildings full of academics with office hours where you can basically just walk in and they'll explain almost anything to you.
* parties full of drunk young people, of all genders, some looking for relationships, others for casual sex.
* access to journals and databases and software that usually costs $$$$$ (and computer labs with it all already set up)
* a weird 'future middle class' social status where you can drink and party and not get a job and go into debt - yet be treated as someone successful.
* a easily understood explanation for that gap in your resume.
* internship opportunities - where you can get your foot in the door at big employers, while being paid and taught how they do things.
* loans for your living costs, despite having no income or credit history.
* access to a library with more (serious, intellectual) books than you could read in a lifetime.
* to leave home, but with training wheels if you're not ready to cook and clean and laundry and pay bills all at once.
* supply control, from 'weed out classes' and limited numbers of student places.
* in-person exams that are at least moderately difficult to cheat on.
* you get a credential at the end of it. Maybe even with a good 'brand'.
