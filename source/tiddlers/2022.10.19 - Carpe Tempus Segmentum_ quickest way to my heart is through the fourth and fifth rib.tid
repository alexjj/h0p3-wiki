title: 2022.10.19 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: quickest way to my heart is through the fourth and fifth rib

Checking out top S01E01's for the past year. Not really been using [[TV: Exploration]] much. //Welcome to Wrexham//, but didn't pass sniff test. [[TTTOTW]]. //Halo//; fail. //Little Demon//; suhlay hunny. //The Old Man//; two actors you'd never expect but clearly push the buttons. Ham and cheese sammmich with fizzy water. [[TTTOTW]]. Peanut butter on English muffins. //The Old Man// continues to entertain while I read terrible things.

Sleep by 5? :P

Woke at 12:30? It was real sleep. //Skintime// with my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]]. Noodles and water.

Offspring came down to grind. Picking back up where we left off is slow going sometimes. Son finished off his first run through [[peruvian bull]]'s work, and he led a good discussion. It was a rabbithole. Then, we put together some [[magic]] decks. `/nod`. 

Mi amor called. Walked my circle upstairs. Also, we did not miss the window for PTO. Beyond sick leave, she has 15 rollover, and 11 to burn by the end of next October.

//The Walk// with mi amor. Clarinet. Bundled up. My legs are growing ashy, and I think I might use my //man//stockings (tyvm) to collect the skin and hair so I'll have a costume. Met Dave (wife is Tammy), an ex-Nascar-minor league person, skilled mechanic, now plumber, who doesn't want his kids in the house (seems to take some pleasure in kicking them out), and wants to move down to NC (wait, I know this story...though this boomer is Gen X). Racism is alive and well. Didn't follow my words well, so I just let him talk. He lives on the very end (next door neighbor who purposely nearly hit mi amor and smiled about it too) of the last extension of our walk; he was surprised we were out that far given our home's address. Got a good deal on his house; life-long resident of these here parts. Invited us over any time, `/nod`. Lots of thinkin' about China and semiconductors. 

[[Family Gathering]] was dope. Baked pasta and water. //Mr. Robot//. I've been imitating the previous episode all day like an echolaliatic. 

Ate CAPOW bread. Unfortunately, I've eaten my fair share. It was really good. Kissed mi amor good night. [[TTTOTW]]. Put my sympaticon to bed. Talked with my offspring about [[MTG]]. We have dumb arguments that make me smile.

Ice cream + //The Old Man// (enjoyed) + [[TTTOTW]]. More time with mi amor. [[TTTOTW]]. Sleep by 11?
