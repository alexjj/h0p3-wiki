how is life going?

Things are weird and stressful. Adam and I’ve been with family for the last almost 3 weeks and things have been insane. And stupid me didn’t think to pack my anxiety meds. So I’m just white knuckling shit and developing super weird coping mechanisms. I can only listen to Taylor swift and I’m doing an insane amount of sudoku and crossword puzzles. 

How about y’all?
Apr 25 12:49am
Shit. I'm sorry.
Apr 25 12:49am
That sounds exceptionally hard. I'm hoping the music and puzzles make it easier on ya.
Apr 25 12:50am
It's been weird, but good here.
Apr 25 12:50am
Watched a movie, //Captain Fantastic//, and I highly recommend. I identify with the main character so strongly, I'm not even sure what to say about it.
Apr 25 12:51am
Looking up the movie now!
Apr 25 12:52am
I wept the entire movie (except the end, which I hated).
Apr 25 12:52am
This movie sounds so up my alley. I’m going to download Hulu and watch it tomorrow! I hope I wind up liking the ending. I always get so frustrated when the ending doesn’t pay off after investing that much time in a movie.
Apr 25 12:54am
Then I wind up not watching movies for a while bc I worry about the time cost not being worth it.
Apr 25 12:54am
I have a hard time finding movies to watch these days.
Apr 25 12:55am
I totally get the cost issue.
Apr 25 12:55am
I’ve been getting in my own head lately about how I invest my free time. I get caught up in weighing all the options and get so log jammed I wind up not doing anything, haha.
Apr 25 12:57am
Yup, lol. I hear that.
Apr 25 12:57am
Sometimes feels like a vicious cycle to me.
Apr 25 12:58am
Yeah. I haven’t been too bad about it here lately. I just want to knit and listen to podcasts. But if I try to read OH GOD it’s a nightmare trying to pick something.
Apr 25 12:59am
Speaking of reading... any recommendations for reading about stoicism?
Apr 25 12:59am
Here's my summary notes of the methods: https://philosopher.life/#Stoicism-fu
Apr 25 1:02am
I don't have any particular books on the topic I find stunning though.
Apr 25 1:03am
Thanks! And speaking of the wiki, I was telling James (jills husband) about your wiki and he said he’d like to read it if you were open to sharing. He studies religion and a little philosophy and was interesting in how you organized the wiki.
Apr 25 1:04am
The content in the wiki*
Apr 25 1:04am
Of course. It's free to everyone. He should feel free to reach out to me as well.
Apr 25 1:04am
[[k0sh3k]]'s (http://k0sh3k.philosopher.life) wiki has a lot of religious work in it as well. The kids wikis are big and blooming, but he probably wouldn't be interested in them (http://1uxb0x.philosopher.life and http://j3d1h.philosopher.life).
Apr 25 1:06am
I’ll share those as well. 

Come across anything interesting on the net today?
Apr 25 1:09am
Haven't really done a ton of surfing today, surprisingly.
Apr 25 1:12am
Gonna be crashing this tomorrow, possibly: https://events.indieweb.org/2020/04/gardens-and-streams-wikis-blogs-and-ui-a-pop-up-indiewebcamp-session-j9bg0pJDBgBD
Apr 25 1:12am
I've run across the feller in charge of it before, so interested to hear him speak.

Offspring and I have been watching Tiktok through Reddit curation, and it's been a delightful form of braincandy.
Apr 25 1:14am
How about you? Anything leaping out to you from the net?
Apr 25 1:16am
I’ve been watching this series called Metal Evolution. It’s a doc by a guy named Sam Dunn and explores the history of metal from a sociological perspective. Sam Dunn is a lifelong metal enthusiast and he makes the topic really engaging bc I’ve never given it much thought before. Turns out I’m REALLY into power metal and folk metal.
Apr 25 1:31am
Nifty!
