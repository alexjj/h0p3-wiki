title: A Wikipedia Entry

Wikipedia should link to us. Be neat to have stats up there. More importantly, I think we ought link to other wikis from Wikipedia (sure, it won't host everything, but it should host a list of that). It's centralized, but it makes a good point. At the very least, every user can ought to have a limited page on Wikipedia; that is not an unreasonable requirement of the tool and Wikipedia community.
