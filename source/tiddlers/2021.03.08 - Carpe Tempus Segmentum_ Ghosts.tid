title: 2021.03.08 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Ghosts

Up into daylight, [[TTTOTW]], although Fireman Time! x2 (never forget what's really important in life). Definitely feels like [[FTO]] of yore ([[masturbation]] included).

Woke at 2? Head on fire, but it was good sleep. I'm going to be sad when it gets too warm for that weighted blanket. Fireman Time! mixed with rumination. A sesh. Simply the best combo. Healing myself by squeezing the sinful icky out of my penor. To my delight, as soon as I got onto my machine (but before I touched it), My Intruder appeared. Ah yes, please do touch [[monster-16]]. She is a very good girl. Drinking it in.

Hugs'n'bugs. I received extras from my daughter today. Nobody is proud. Alrighty. I know that feel, bro. Speaking of which, Scout is on a normal sleeping schedule (good, don't fall into my dark spiral of frenetic half-wokedness).

Took the vehicle in, booked for tomorrow. They were crazy busy.

//Skintime//. Listened. Trolled. Did my do. Her competence is gorgeous, quiet ripostes. At war with the evil of the world. 

Stumbled upon again, watched her read it. `/gulp`. No idea what highlights mean, gestures. I have no idea how to describe the experience either. A fascinating object now in my clipboard. WTF!? XD.

Regained composure, finished the draft decks and played a game. Necro is out, but don't see other changes to make. I have too much deck manipulation, CA, and bombs. It's absurd. They basically passed half the best cards back to me. Interesting to see our intuitions demonstrated to be flawed again and again in this practice. Cards we know are good in constructed just fall apart in limited^^tm^^. 

Called a random person because my [[Root User]] required it of me. Called [[chameleon]] (vid was interesting, btw) and [[JRE]].

[[TTTOTW]]. Ghosts on my system, cracking through the shell. GHOSTS, goddamnit.

[[Family Gathering]] was amazing. It must be that special cheese. Scout's Indian is crazy. Something I don't remember the name of, potato outside, veggie inside, fried, dope. Naan and butter/tikka combo chicken. Yet again, I ate all the way to the tippy top, though right before I'd get sick. 

Finished a game with my daughter. She's having fun (even if she doesn't want to admit it :P).

VC with [[chameleon]]! =). Shot the shit. Binding ourselves together. She dragged me onto Discord for an image. I love you (and the other [[Root luh-Users|Root Users]] trapped in that pit that I probably will also get sucked back into despite my kicking and screaming - you people fucking disgust me! :P). 

CBD Tincture tried. I prefer to inhale. 

Gave them my extras, then rebuilt, played one more. Shuffled up and drafted again with Scout this time (my son's coaxing) and 4 packs. Listened to music and symmetrically* (I know, I know) held hands (I have no idea how to explain the wonder of holding your daughter's hands at the table while listening to music, talking, and thinking about something as stupid as magic). They did a much better job this time (everyone likes shopping for cards [my son loud and giddy]). I still made out like a bandit though:

* Arcanis
* Spell Contortion
* MTutor
* Whispers
* Capsize
* ORing
* WShards
* MoR
* Horizons
* Mobilization
* Mangara
* EDragon
* SCircle
* DoJ
* ETutor
* Wrath
* Elixir of Immortality
* Talisman of Progress
* Maze
* JKite
* Top
* Belcher
* Foundry
* Sword (haha, so lucky)

My penis is dripping just looking at this d~~i~~eck. A classic archetype. Late game shark, highly reactive, tutelage to adapt, I-Win buttons, anti-deckteck (then I will play much more conservatively, fully willing to just stall them out for 30 straight turns [welcome to hell with me, your host: [[h0p3]]!]), with some flexible control (not a lot of permanent answers  and X-for-1s though). Almost went Humility (and Proteus Staff seemed interesting too), but not convinced with these badbois and lack of an early game. They keep handing me control cards, so I'm going to play it. It's my wheelhouse anyway.

We had experimental banana bread that had a stout pudding feel to it. Chocalate chips too. Dessert is good. I haven't gained weight yet (though my wife has, which is hilarious :P).
