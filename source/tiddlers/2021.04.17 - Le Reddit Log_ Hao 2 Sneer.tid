title: 2021.04.17 - Le Reddit Log: Hao 2 Sneer

//The mods banned me and removed my comments. If you are going to talk about me in a public forum, shouldn't I have the opportunity to speak at the same public venue with you? You be the judge; ask yourself if the censorship is warranted.<<ref "i">> I think I've been quite respectful (thank you to those of you who were kind, treated me like a human being, and were charitable in your interpretation). In any case, I still have a voice from my wiki (and elsewhere, if we need). I'll do my best to maintain the actual record of [[our conversation|Find The Others]] together.<<ref "t">> Let us be accountable together. Feel free to [[Contact]] me. I speak with all kinds.//

https://www.reddit.com/r/badphilosophy/comments/mse5bf/%CF%95_objective_normative_meaning_is_real/

<<<
>> That's very high praise, thank you. That book aimed for something quite difficult, and I respect its failings too. 

> This is like that book that tried to prove 1+1=2.

''''

>> Thank you. I hope [[The Good]], as a page, is as good as I can make it (it's not, sadly, but I'll keep trying). I'm glad you enjoyed it.

> THis is really fucking good. Good job bringing this here

''''

>> Hey there! You might consider looking elsewhere. [Like you], I'm a huge fan of decentralization (that's part of the work itself actually; the html file lives on a wide variety of networks).

> My attention span died after one paragraph of their intentionally overwrought prose.

''''

>> That's a good question. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_logic_symbols. 

> i'm getting errors for the ones after "or" and before "for all", what are they?

''''

>>> My writing contains a lot, and [[that page|Why You Might Hate Me]] is one of many. It exists for a reason. At the very least, I want people to have the chance to see that I doubt myself like that and to approach me like I'm a human (many people don't).
>>> I wouldn't say I'm jaded by my writing. I've written every day for 5 years in my wiki, and I don't intend to stop. I am jaded by lots of people though. I'm glad I still have hope for the world. It's an honor to meet you.

>> The writer seems to be getting pretty jaded with his own thoughts.

>> "I have recursively become my own asshat on an asshat. Who doesn't love their own puns, idioms, and malaphors? I'm an ego wrapped in skin. Yes, I am forced to often seek the salience in the zoo of myself, blindly desensitized to my own odor. My shit stinks, and I am my own brain vomit. Yes, I am salty about the world, but that's what The Salience does. I'm convinced, given enough time, most people grow to dislike me enough to dislove me."

> ''''

>> Thank you. I appreciate that comment. I agree with a lot of what Saint Spinoza has to say, although I don't agree to his determinism. I admire his pantheism as well. Hope you take a look around, there's so much more than that single page. HMU sometime.

>Somehow you can tell the author is a Spinozist just from the animated rainbow background

>This rules, actually

''''

>>>>>> What makes a good explanatory style?
>>>>>> The reader has considerable obligations.
>>>>>> I have my opinions about why it showed up in badphilosophy after 5 years, and I don't think it's because people are attempting to engage in good faith philosophical discourse. I'm aware of who posted it and one other responder in that thread.
>>>>>> That's a place where people go to make fun of others largely to feel better about themselves. It's not where people actually dissect what's wrong with an argument, nor where they offer constructive solutions.
>>>>>> My bet is that you really don't know what you're lookin' at. I don't think I would in your shoes.
>>>>>> Pulling a single sentence or even a single page out of the context of the entire ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 is definitely missing the point. I agree that [[The Good]], as a page, is fundamental to my work. I am accountable to that.
>>>>>> I'm willing to grant that most people don't have the time to think about what I do, but I'm not going to act like they took the time when they didn't.
>>>>>> `...is typing`
>>>>>> Hi there, btw. I'm heading off to [[Family Time]] (<--a link in my wiki). I am glad to speak with you. I appreciate that you are willing to disagree with me. That's part of respecting each other.
>>>>>> Some of my correspondence lasts for hundreds of pages (e.g. [[Find The Others]]).
>>>>>> Talk with you soon.

>>>>> You’re welcome to clarify, if you want.
>>>>> But have the expectation that I might disagree, and understand that’s still a part of discourse. Discourse isn’t only when people agree with you. And your explanatory style is problematic, which is why it ended up in the bad-philosophy subreddit.

>>>> I agree that not all "doublings" are going to clear much up.
>>>> I think I understood your point.
>>>> Which was largely rhetorical.
>>>> Are you interested in discussing what I mean? It doesn't seem like it, but I'll do my best to clarify.
>>>> We can start over, if you want. You're intelligent, and it's rare to find people who are trying to engage in philosophical discourse in good faith. I think you are not only capable of it, but you could use more companions to think with you. We all could.

>>>  What about my post indicated that I needed a wikipedia link?
>>>  I think you missed the point. My explanation is this: there was much missingness in the missing, of the point, it went on infinitely, but also regressively. Does that help clear things up? No? Ah. Funny how doubling a word and adding a suffix isn’t very helpful.

>> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_the_criterion

>> In case you were wondering. `/salute`

> '''' >
>  "The Criterion of all criterions, including the infinigressing criterion of criterionness"

''''

>> That's probably what the proletariat needs at this point. I'm all ears, homie. I appreciate walking through your post history. I bet we'd have a lot to talk about.

> I knew the Konami Code was the cheat code for how to hack the Universe.

''''

>> Not to my knowledge. Those are logic symbols. They can be useful for thinking about GTA.

> Is that GTA Cheatcode ?

''''

>> It's an expensive matter to think and talk about. I am never wise enough.

> "God, I'm so arrogantly baller for even trying; I can only do my best."

''''

>>>>>> I don't know if you read through what they linked. I agree that we have lots in common in our writing, but there's some obvious differences too. We're two people meeting each other for the first time. You're not even attempting to be fair or speak in good faith. Are you having fun?

>>>>> Yeah sure - an account that never really posts here shows us to converse in the exact pseudo-schizophrenic way you do and also shills your site lol

>>>> I don't have an alt account. I do what I can to unify my identity across the internet. It's an expensive task in many respects. You don't happen to use alt accounts, do you? They seem to be useful for sneering without actually putting skin in the game. I speak with plenty of anons. It's my honor.

>>> why are you talking to your alt account lmfao...

>> ''''

>>>>>>>> Aye. I agree. Entertainment is a mere drug far too often. And, and, of course, not all crucial conversations are enjoyable. I think most aren't enjoyable for me, but I do what I can. Also, I try to study the use of money in the world, so I can appreciate that pain. There are only so many places we can {[[Focus]]}.

>>>>>>> Tried to edit a parting shot and it wouldn't let me...

>>>>>>> "As above; so below..." I haven't always been kind either, and while it can be fun to shitpost or be an edgelord or show the trolls how it's done (or be nationally successful on the competitive debate circuit)... Sometimes entertainment is not the highest value in life

>>>>>> Sleep well, my friend.

>>>>> To quickly reply to one of your questions (I am curling up in bed on my phone and about to pass out)...

>>>>> I'm going through a backlog of both Kabbalistic texts and the work / recommendations of Phillipe Langdon (The Ascension Handbook) as well as revisiting the work of Pastor Ahyh via yhwh.com and yhwh.com/index.htm (browsing this archive requires manually repairing URLs by uncapitalizing words)

>>>>> At some point I also intend to gain a more mundane sort of knowledge by studying information pertaining to financial markets and investment strategy. Gotta get that bread, you know

>>>> I'm sitting here digesting your words, nodding my head. Yeah, we agree, homie. By the way, thanks for being here with me. It means a lot to me.

>>>>>  I have credentials in insanity, so I'm not one to dismiss or besmirch the "crazy." 

>>>> I can see that. I find most people have to have their bubble burst before they've got the necessary experience under their belt to empathize with the crazies. You know how it do, obviously. =)

>>>>>  My lot in life is such that I will never be afforded the privilege of authority, as in - people will have to receive what I offer based on some other merit or rationale than I am "an authority."

>>>> You are a person. That is a sufficient reason to listen. I think it's part of exercising The Golden Rule that I take each person's perspective as thoughtfully as I can. I aint tellin' you anything new though. I can see that. It's a pleasure to meet you.

>>>>>  I've had to come to grips with that, and it is what it is. It can be fun to play The Fool, after all (http://yhwh.com/tarot/tarot0.htm).

>>>> I know this feel. I hate to say it, but it's not always fun to me. Like you, I take that role seriously (though I do not claim to do it well). "The most difficult character in comedy is that of the fool, and he must be no simpleton that plays the part." "[T]he fool...claims license to criticize all and sundry without reprisal, since his madness defines him as not fully a person and therefore not a political being with political desires and ambitions."

>>>>>  I'd certainly be interested in a conversation.

>>>> Well, there's no rush. I'm reachable on Reddit and by other means https://philosopher.life/#Contact%20h0p3. 

>>>>>  Your website is very dense, and I did not read it deeply, not because I am dismissing it at all - but rather because I am currently chewing through a whole backlog of very dense reading,

>>>> Yes, it is extremely dense. To make matters worse, it's also ridiculously long (most people don't know how much the html file contains). It is probably the longest piece of writing from a single person in history (I think of the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 as one document). Imho, it's better to chew through your backlog than worry about my writing. 

>>>> I know this backlog pain. Lawd! Lol. What's on your reading list? I like to explore. 

>>>>>  a paradigm I firmly believe is that we are all having our own subjective experience of objective reality. My intuition tells me you understand this.

>>>> Absolutely. That's well said. Not a lot of people are going to appreciate the implications of your claim. It's so expensive to empathize with people. Oy. I read and write like the wind trying to gather even a semblance of understanding of objective reality. 

>>>>>  And, enjoyably though much more rarely, I sometimes come across folk who seem to have very valuable and useful things to say to help me decipher objective reality and that elusive chestnut, Truth. Perhaps you do, too! 

>>>> Yes, I'm very lucky to come across people who help me uncover what is truly valuable in the world. 

>>>>>  Reaching out directly is certainly a very good way to grab my attention and reorient my priorities. :)

>>>> I use f5bot for alerts. Once in a great while, someone mentions my work. I try to be present and responsive. Mr. Rogers was probably a saint of a man, and he was consistent in responding to thousands of people (I find it daunting). I hope to be like him. Beetlejuicing sometimes allows me to connect with others I wouldn't have had the chance to meet otherwise. 

>>>>>  I've been mulling over the idea and process of creating my own web-domain, though I often don't think what I have to offer is much of an enticing product, so my time usually feels better spent in other ways, rather than building a monument to myself.

>>>> Well, if you ever have to write a monument, you might check out https://tiddlywiki.com. It's a really nice tool. Everyone in my family keeps one (and lots of friends too). It's how we own our social network, nuts and bolts too, building our community and preserving the stories of who we are together. I'm lucky to read what my offspring have to write during Family Time.

>>>> What are some things you're most glad to have spent your time and energy on?

>>>>>  As fun as H8ERADE might've been, most of drdeezee.com's content was lost to time...relatedly, if you want to pull me up on the internet archive, there's more fun examples. 

>>>> I know how that goes. I have nothing left from my site from the 90's, sadly, and only fragments of 00's too. Writing has come and gone for me. I'm hoping it stays for good until I die. 

>>>> People like us are doomed to be quite aware of our loneliness. I'm hoping that you do have "people who want to hear about your life anyway." 

>>>> You have a wide range in your writing. I appreciate your candor and even how you stare down the painful truths with integrity. I can see that others haven't been kind to you either. 

>>>>> The most insightful things I have to share I haven't committed to a sort of record because of the philosophical problem involved in creating records. Once you commit something to a state of impermanence, anybody coming along to interact with it will always be able to interpret it on their own terms and to their own ends. Intuitively to me, this is a big part of the equation of why "unwritten doctrines" are extremely common in all sorts of disciplines and esoteric knowledge systems - from Plato to Kabbalah. It's not necessarily about elitism, but about the facts of human communication (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/beginning-art-slowing-down-thinking-things-through-chapter-donner/).

>>>> Oh boy, yeah, I feel this too. The commitment is profound, especially out here in the desert of the interwebs. I think most people have internalized the tragedy of the commons and the spectacle of so much media to the point that they've given up even trying to prescribe to themselves a kinder alternative in their consumption and creation habits. It makes the commitment of writing so expensive. There are conversations that I simply prefer to have only in-person too.

>>>>>  ::EDIT:: I did, incorrectly, presume this was a PM but uh, public nakedness can always be amusing so, what the hell. Haha. And yes, I expect a full evisceration on badphilosophy. Hopefully it won't be memorable enough to stop me from occasionally enjoying some shitposting here.

>>>> In part, I think we're here to show the trolls how it's done. I'm thoroughly enjoying speaking with you.

>>> I have credentials in insanity, so I'm not one to dismiss or besmirch the "crazy." My lot in life is such that I will never be afforded the privilege of authority, as in - people will have to receive what I offer based on some other merit or rationale than I am "an authority." Proving I am correct about anything I might have to give to someone is to miss the point and value of the exchange, but gosh darn if I don't love a good debate because of my background.

>>> I've had to come to grips with that, and it is what it is. It can be fun to play The Fool, after all (http://yhwh.com/tarot/tarot0.htm).

>>> I'd certainly be interested in a conversation. Your website is very dense, and I did not read it deeply, not because I am dismissing it at all - but rather because I am currently chewing through a whole backlog of very dense reading, and partly because a paradigm I firmly believe is that we are all having our own subjective experience of objective reality. My intuition tells me you understand this. Some people won't agree to this at all and then I've come across some people who have varying degrees of understanding about this premise and what it truly implies. And, enjoyably though much more rarely, I sometimes come across folk who seem to have very valuable and useful things to say to help me decipher objective reality and that elusive chestnut, Truth. Perhaps you do, too! Reaching out directly is certainly a very good way to grab my attention and reorient my priorities. :)

>>> I've been mulling over the idea and process of creating my own web-domain, though I often don't think what I have to offer is much of an enticing product, so my time usually feels better spent in other ways, rather than building a monument to myself.

>>> As fun as H8ERADE might've been, most of drdeezee.com's content was lost to time. The best stuff is fragmented - you'd have to parse this text [https://www.fictionpress.com/s/3084526/1/God-Complex] with this image repository [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B15dsMEEFJvpVjQtbV9VemQ1eTg?usp=sharing] and it's a pretty time consuming ask. And, it should be said, "Dr. Deezee" is, like any good internet handle, partly a persona to put on.

>>> (Un)relatedly, if you want to pull me up on the internet archive, there's more fun examples. Like this one (http://www.the-spearhead.com/2010/02/12/the-legend-of-truth/) where again, images really help (https://imgur.com/a/38NtB).

>>> The most insightful things I have to share I haven't committed to a sort of record because of the philosophical problem involved in creating records. Once you commit something to a state of impermanence, anybody coming along to interact with it will always be able to interpret it on their own terms and to their own ends.

>> Hello there, DrDeezee. My name is h0p3. I'm a person, just like you and Paul. I can see we both have a lot in common. I speak with all kinds of people. It is my honor to meet you. Your account is fascinating, and it seems to me like you've been around the block. I'm grateful that you share yourself with others online (it's a very expensive task). I appreciate [your previous work](http://www.drdeezee.com/blogs/dr-deezee/todays-hate-bomb-metaphysics). If you ever want a penpal, HMU. Some of my correspondence lasts for hundreds of pages (all found in the wiki; even this conversation will find its way into my wiki). I know most people who encounter me or my work think I'm crazy (some consider my madness a very good thing, and I think it's fair to say most do not).

> 1 Corinthians 1:27 implies to me that Paul was probably regarded in his day like we might be regarding this guy. ;)

''''

>> Thank you. Life is full of surprises (many of them wonderful), and it's a pleasure to meet you.

> What a serendipitous find

''''

>>>>>> That was an interesting video to see this year. There's tons more just as humorous and interesting to find on my site, if you want. My goal isn't to troll, but I appreciate that Tit For Two Tats requires defection sometimes. I will continue speaking with you (we can feed each other). I speak with all kinds.

>>>>> LOL after poking around your troll site for like 5 minutes, I found a link to this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDnd7_lSM3M
>>>>> Kindly stop trolling here and promoting your lame ass edgelord site.

>>>> It's not an ARG. This is just real people talking here. Some of it is creative, but I don't think most of it is. I'm responding to what people have said here, and I think that's fair. I don't have a problem with self-promotion (and that's something you can track, if you'd like; I aim to be hedged conservative about it). I am aware of some of the archiving of Reddit; not everything is captured in the end.

>>> Kindly take your ARG and creative writing somewhere else lol. And also stop shilling your site everywhere. BTW even if you autodelete your post history, it is archived on several sites

>> ''''

>>> purple prose

>> Thank you. I aim to write that page "to the nines." There's a ton of writing in the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 which isn't intended to be that at all. 

>>> write insufferably

>> I agree that most people find it insufferable. Some don't. Perhaps it is a matter of taste. 

>>> TempleOS aesthetics

>> Thank you. I speak about this as well. Terry was a very special person.

>>> disguise your megalomania by being tongue-in-cheek

>> That's an important charge to consider. I'll do that carefully with you, if you want. I think about who we are together with my skin in the game, and I expect the same of others.

>>> how to be philosopher:

>> I would be interested to hear from you what makes a good philosopher.

> "I humbly offer you my highly-educated (i.e. these aren't my memes) guess-vision of this all-encompassing hyperobject with which Humanity has been wrestling from the beginning of philosophy, the love of wisdom."

> how to be philosopher:

> purple prose
> write insufferably
> TempleOS aesthetics
> disguise your megalomania by being tongue-in-cheek

''''

>> XD. I'm glad it's not that simple. There's lots to think about.

> Here it is, philosophy solved: "Yes, I worship this non-personified Almighty God. The Master of Reality has but one power: giving meaning (which turns out to be the only power that matters). Be Thou My Vision! I am your slave. The Good is the one true God. Monotheism, absurd warts and all, has always been correct to point to the Goddiest God of them All, the reason I admire it more than polytheism."

''''

>> (´༎ຶ ͜ʖ ༎ຶ)

> 💥8| @_@

''''

>>>>> "Do what you can, with what you have, where you are."
>>>>> A pretty serviceable heuristic.

>>>> Yes, it is. XD. You got that right. I'm doing what I can with what little I have.

>>> Conveying ineffability is a real bitch, eh? ;)

>>>> There's ~15k pages in that one html file; it takes a while to generalize about it. But, you have a point. I am often dumb, and I think it's fair to say I'm a madman. I admire your kindness. I'm glad to speak with you. Conversation is a sacrament to me.

>>> Youre welcome and if you arent dumb or insane im sorry for assuming you are. Its just usually a safe assumption

>> Thank you. I'm glad you find it cool.

> this is cool. Not, like, its actual content, which im not going to read carefully and which i assume is dumb or insane, but its general aesthetic

''''

>> Like speakin' in tongues, may there be cascades of symbols that point to what really matters most.

> It's official, true philosophy can only be done in wingdings

''''

> Me neither. `/salute`. It's an honor to meet you.
