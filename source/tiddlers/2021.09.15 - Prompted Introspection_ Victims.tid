title: 2021.09.15 - Prompted Introspection: Victims

!! You see a friend getting into their third emotionally abusive relationship in a row. Are they a victim?

It goes without saying: they are indisputably a victim. They might not be a blameless victim, and that is the key to answering this question.

It depends (surprise!), and I think this answer comes in [[dok]] as well. This is a classic type of problem in deontology. Let us say that, prima facie, X is not wrong, but as we develop increasingly accurate predictive models of the world, it becomes clearer that the consequential risks of X become problematic. There appears to be multi-stage or higher-order reasoning to engage in, even within The CI, as the particularities of the circumstantial contents of our updated maxims become fleshed out, so to speak. It is here that X, which initially was moral, can become immoral. 

Victimhood comes in degrees. Normally, walking on the street might be just fine, but if we have reason to believe there are nails on that street, or if I tell you that's a nail in front of you, you may be somewhat more culpable for having stepped on a nail. It's not your fault that the nail is there, but stepping on it, to some [[dok]], may be. I am quite uncomfortable drawing these lines. The added problem is how to reason about autonomous nails, and yet again, we are not responsible for the existence of the nail on the road, but we are responsible for how we reason and behave in virtue of knowing about their existence on the road. I consider it best to be hedged-conservative to avoid unjustified victim-blaming. 

Note how there are possible worlds in which one has a string of bad [[luck]], that they couldn't have known better no matter how thoughtful they were. We might imagine each successive relationship as being with a tailormade stepping-stone sociopath, for example. They would be a blameless victim, by definition, in these cases.

Failures to attempt to become wiser are deeply problematic. I suppose my shitty out here is a virtue-theoretic quasi-anti-codificationist claim: we'll have to take it on a case-by-case basis. You simply haven't provided enough information for us to make a fitting judgment beyond the structures we have here.
