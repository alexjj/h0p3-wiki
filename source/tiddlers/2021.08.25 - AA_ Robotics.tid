Thinking of you —how’s the storm?
=).
It was fine. [[k0sh3k]] had her migraine for a week, but it was just rain for us, nothing more.
Kinda missed us.
How are you doing?
That’s good —glad you guys are ok
I think I have mostly climbed out of the hole I was in most of the summer now that school has started...but tired
Yes, ma'am.
I can imagine it's exceptionally tiring.
And I am up to 15 chickens 🐓
haha, noice
Did you nab a rooster for that or how'd you manage that?
(and, have you grown sick of eating eggs to the point that you can't give them away?)
The little ones aren’t laying yet but I think I have a rooster now but not sure
Dope.
I got six from the store as chicks and two we hatched from some fertilized eggs I got from a friend
I manage to find people that want eggs so far
When all of them are laying then I don’t know—I suppose we can start feeding the dogs scrambled eggs hehe
Everyone needs eggs. We've got two neighbors that keep their own (though, not nearly as excellent as the housing you've built for yours.
I bet they would enjoy that.
How was [[AG]]'s summer engineering program?
It was awesome—she really enjoyed it
Perfect.
What's she like most about it?
I think the part she liked the most was realizing their are other awkward people just like her
lol
😊
That is excellent.
We started a robotics club/elective —the kids are learning with elegoo kits
Very nice. That can do a lot of things.

We can add from there — start with the basics
I like that way more than the robotics kits that I saw in Tennessee.
Its only $36
And works with Arduino
Comes with a book of 22 lessons and theres a bunch of open source stuff
I hope it opens many types of doors for her.
Me too
She said they worked with stuff like that at camp?
Hows the kidlets?
They are doing alright. We've been able to walk most days. They are more on their own otherwise.
Listening to Asimov together, and that's been a pleasure.
Time is flying by, lol.
Ooooo love Isaac ❤️😊
I bet
Walking is good —its been hot here
Yeah. We've been waiting until it's a bit later to try to avoid it. Still come home soaked often enough. Meeting a few neighbors in the hood too, so that's been interesting.
Different from apartments, considerably.
I bet so
I wait until the evening to go see my chickens...to humid/hot when I first get home
They are putting in some big homes down the road from us —will help value our little house
Noice. I assume the last year has given a decent boost there.
Yeah the housing market has been pretty hot
Everything is hot. Lol.
Yep
How is [[UJ]] doing? Has his ride slowed down enough to be comfortable? Baptized by fire in his (*relatively) new position.
Yeah covid makes it tricky... scores sucked last year
Then of course there is the random 3rd grader who can’t wipe his own butt and wants help or the child that throws shoes
That makes sense. Nothing he could do about the scores. Bigger fish to fry for so many.
Lol. Yeah.
That too.
He has to be a dad to so many.
An impossible task.
I guess it makes every day a little different —He is doing good though
It would be nice if Hardin county acquired more subs —he has had to sub a lot so far
I am surprised by that.
That seems unacceptable. He's got a lot on his plate.
Yeah but when there are no subs and teachers out with covid ...makes it hard
A year of survival.
Yeah and I am pretty sure several counties are just short teachers ....the Vid has not been good for education
haha, "The Vid" - I've not heard this term yet.
😜
[[K]] is student teaching at Butler hs in Louisville this semester
One more year and maybe it will even out.
I hope it does —crazy days
It sounded like he gets to work with a pleasant bunch in his first batch.
He likes his mentor teacher
Says he understands now why [[UJ]] and I nap hehe
haha, yeah
All the spoons are spent before noon.
I think he’s planning on subbing in the spring—-I bet that he will get job offers though
Exactly....
Yeah, I'd bet on that too.
The times I have seen him tutor —he’s really good. Asks good thought provoking questions
He’s good with kids too patient but doesn’t let them push his buttons
Give it time. I'm sure patience will be lost and buttons pushed. Just have to find the right monsters.
Very true
You have any monsters in your classrooms this year?
Not this year —one potential new junior and a new to me kid that is on the spectrum but he and I are doing real well
You do excellently with the 'tistics. :P
Love them ❤️😊
<3
I'm hoping that maybe next summer you'll be in a position to teach at ECTC, assuming the world slows down some, etc.
He just speaks his mind —its not a bad thing
Sometimes those sort make me laugh in class when I'm not supposed to.
Me too —I should have already worked on that. Just trying to still heal and get my schedule back
Yes! It’s a good thing for masks sometimes hehe
Ha, I hadn't even considered that. May your eyes never betray you. =)
How is your health?
They do —but at least it helps some
The mask gives you plausible deniability.
I am good —arm is still sore and healing but in a world of sickness I am pretty healthy
Yeah, true dat.
Still sleeping on the couch —can get comfortable in the bed. Need to figure out a way to support my back?
Err can’t get comfortable
I am a huge couch sleeping fan. When my son was 3ish I found him sleeping in a cubby hole in his room one morning. I think the couch has something in common for me with the weighted blanket. I got me one of them foam body pillows. Not sure if that would be useful.
It might be...I was also looking at a wedge
Gotta experiment until something clicks. I hope sooner rather than later.
Can’t sleep on my left and have trouble pushing myself up on the left so yeah gotta work on trying things
[[k0sh3k]] has been on the hunt for a pillow for quite a while. Her neck has been doing poorly. They got in her PT and trying different things out. Tense muscles (plus the scoliosis).
She doesn't care for a bed. Also seems to be preferring the couch or a chair in a lot of cases.
Yeah I am done with therapy (or so they said) but I think I could have gone longer. I am not good at doing it on my own
Some times the couch or recliner is just better
Gotta get one for the classroom, if you don't already.
Yes!!
I am just missing a good chair or couch in my room. I now have a fridge, microwave and keurig
XD
A home away from home.
I've been keeping a ridiculous number of high fructose pastries (like honey buns) in my room. Like a gingerbread dungeon in which I bribe people to do some work with me (or enjoy a show or whatever).
The basement is where I belong. I was born for it.
Ooooo 🍩!
You could bribe me with pastries! Dough based love language hehe
lmao
I'd say I bribe myself with them, but I'm not exactly rewarding myself for doing what I don't want to do with them. I want to eat all of them, lol.
I swear they call to me....
I consider a honey bun more addictive than a bag of Doritos (and, to my eyes, once you open bag, regardless of size, you should finish on the spot, no exceptions).
I use wavy potato chips as a vehicle for blue cheese dressing
I have never tried that. I have a new thing to try.
Good stuff
I think my favorite use of blue cheese is still those wings from Richmond.
I need to figure out how to make those.
Yes —Madison Garden wings....I need more of those in my life too
Still haven’t found any others that are as good
[[5c0ut]] doing ok?
He's hanging in there. I don't think he's doing well, but he's in much better shape than last year.
Better shape is good
Lots of job hopping, trying to find a place that suits him. He's been spending more time on his own than when we he first arrived, although it matches how he tends to be with most of his roommates.
I'm proud of him for not touching alcohol for a very long time now.
That is good
I hope he can find a place to use his gifts without all the stress
He says this is the most stable he has been, but he's not feeling hopeful or like there's much reason to think he can achieve more, as though he has plateaued. I hope he can too.
Yeah I would just live for him to find a place to be happy and succeed
Just turned 30, so, I assume this is the decade it happens.
`/fistpump`
Woot woot
We can cheer him on!
I have eaten my blue cheese chips and am now one with my pillow! Love you bunches ❤️😊
Love you. Hope you get some good sleep too.
🥰😴

Made me giggle
Aliens with moogs is my favorite. =)
I loves it
