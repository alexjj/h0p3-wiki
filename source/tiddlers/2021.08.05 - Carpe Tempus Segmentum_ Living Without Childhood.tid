title: 2021.08.05 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Living Without Childhood

Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. Spoke with many [[anon]]s. It went alright. I faced many [[others]] as best I could. Sleep by 5:30?

Woke at 1:30? Fireman Time! Delight upon taking my sleeping mask off.

Lightning & Tears.

If you didn't feel old yet here you go. A boomer was trying to make a joke with some W-employslave. She was doing the game red light green light, and the dude who I think is 18ish wasn't understanding  what was going on. So as I'm walking by I just look at him and tell him it's an old children's  game. He looked at me and then at her and just stared at her and said "oh. I'm sorry I never had a childhood"... I laughed and felt for him at the same time lol.

//The Walk// with my offspring. Vapelyfe. Son did his work, and he had stuff to talk about. He inspires storytelling in us. My daughter chose her path. I told the truth, and we moved on. It was a pleasant walk, though more bouts of silence than usual. The Bunny near the "Unmask our children" blue house seemed to stick around with us. We stopped by the side of the road to sit down, try to become familiar. My daughter wants the corvids (which I kept calling the Covids, ofc) to be her friend. Shiny stuff + food has to go a long way. We saw Bill, he didn't remember (and I wouldn't even be qualified to cast the last stone here) anyone's name (worked on different mnenomics with him, since he was into it), and [[Reggie]] had his friend over!

We finished off our asset project. Worked on automated metadata tagging with my son, and a notification system for a cronjob with my daughter. Tasks we'll accomplish soon enough, I hope.

My wife feels off today. //Skintime//, walked through her day. Listened to music with my sleeping mask on.

We did not have [[Family Gathering]] since I wasn't there for 10 minutes. =/. My daughter will say "no" every time, and that's ridiculous. Stop asking her. It doesn't seem to happen unless I make it happen. I need to fix that. In any case, we all had hotdogs, kiwi, squash, and zucchini, but separately and asynchronously tonight.

Talked with [[5t3v3]]. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. 

Took a shit. Noodles + Honey Whiskey. Footbath + LolVod.

Sent them to bed. Hugs'n'bugs. My daughter, of course, isn't listening. It's not about reason with her. She knows the argument. It's her price to pay now.
