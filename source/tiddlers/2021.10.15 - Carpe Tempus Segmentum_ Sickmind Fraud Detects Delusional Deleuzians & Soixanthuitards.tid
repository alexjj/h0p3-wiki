title: 2021.10.15 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Sickmind Fraud Detects Delusional Deleuzians & Soixanthuitards

Woke at 7:30. What in the blazes? That sleep was amazing. Missed her. =/. [[ASK]]ing. [[TTTOTW]].

I ate all the leftovers: salad, ribs, soup, pineapple, coffee. Footbath + [[TTTOTW]] + LoLWorlds (I'm way behind,<<ref "m">> but whatever). I feel like I understand some of that World/Cold war proxy competition we see in the Olympics, Chess, Hockey, etc. And, for the record, the West is dying by that token. China and SKorea are breathtaking. 

Fireman Time! Half-shower. Cleaning. [[TTTOTW]]. 

Son and I made chili together, and he cleaned up around the house. My daughter worked on looking through our bank account to make sure the cancelled purchase from the card manufacturer went through, and more thinking about ledgers. She's gotta get her bloodwork test set up again (setting aside time here to do it now, as I've asked enough times otherwise). Son's still ricing. He's got the basics up (and, I hope he'll continue to make progress on his own time, experimentation is so crucial). Thinking about tuples and the fuzzier lines between data types and structures (and, I realize, some people don't think there's anything fuzzy about it). [[TTTOTW]]. An encounter with [[Anders Aamodt]] (and I knew I knew the name from somewhere, but didn't connect any dots until well after).

[[JRE]] called. He's recommended //Midnight Mass// to us, and //Malignant// to my wife. He's enjoyed //Squid Game//. Work is work. Boys have been out of daycare 3 out 8 weeks. [[Q]] is beginning to talk, possibly: "mine, mine, mine" like his brother. He arrived at the doctor's office (the wrong one) and had to go. Will call me back later. I think he was busy in the end, understandably. That's fatherhood, no doubt. It's very expensive to spend what remains of one's time and energy at the end of the day.

//The Walk// with my offspring was outstanding. Spent even more time motivating [[Rust]] (so excited). Elaine of The Farmhouse, henceforth Elaine, to be differentiated where necessary, was standing on her very long, dusty driveway as we waved from roadside. She was obviously weighing and praying, waiting for a sign of God's preordination for us to visit her (though my offspring did not recognize that). We went to visit the elderly, to know what they are made of, to understand the human condition first-hand, and to get to know our neighbor. She hugged my daughter (perfectly awkward for my daughter). My offspring toe'd every single line of [[civil]]ity and beyond, bending over  backwards not to correct a single thing this woman said (my god, so many serious errors), giving her charitable, active listening, and searching for [[The Other]]. They did have a light touch, and Elaine at least felt it. She lives an austere life, and claims, of course, not to be of this world (my offspring missed many of the symbols she handed us). She retold her story, and she said it was only a decade with her sister-in-law. She made the same mistake as yesterday (okay, so maybe she's not as intact). She showed us the water damage and remodeling of the home, and her son will be living here with his wife (they can't have children) when she dies. I think her offspring may be lying to their mother, feeding her delusions about the spiritual dimension (easier to lie in the moment than pay any of the other prices for [[intimacy]] with her). There was a lot to think about in the encounter, and I continue to caution them to limit their assumptions on the surface here. Eventually, a continued discussion of garbage collection and different memory safety considerations (which, it turns out, is quite a useful point regarding Elaine here too). My son seemed to enjoy his history enough. Computers and Elaine dominated our conversation.

[[5c0ut]] says his work gave him a U-Haul and a bed. I'm surprised by that. He was putting the room together differently. Looks spiffy.

//The Walk// with mi amor, a short one, she chose the path. She's pushing to become a peer reviewer for the prestigious journal in her wildly overspecialized field (the most incestuous part of academia here). We went to visit Elaine. Elaine spoke more freely with her (I hand very little to anyone in this space often enough, and gestures are often going to do my work for me), and it is clear we have met this woman many, many times in our lives. She was watching a local Catholic TV channel mass after her visiting her local, saw people as generally good (purposely looking away from the truth), same slip of calling her son her husband as earlier, so lonely she talks to the dead all day, defends her priests against any claims of wrongdoing, sees miracles everywhere, etc. This woman is deeply depressed, I'm talkin: [[Kitschy Kitchen Klich√©s]] toaster-bathbomb depressed. My wife said I was a Good Man Charlie Brown. My wife is correct in her assessment that she doesn't seem to hang out with anyone who calls themselves Christian. It's obvious why: they aren't actually. It has been my argument for a very long time now. 

[[TTTOTW]] while the students were in study session. [[ASK]]ing. She slept hard and promises to fart in front of me when she has the opportunity. Ate muh chili with chips. Then folks decided we were going to party in my room tonight anyway. Aight. Cool. They ate, we had some snacks, and we watched the Birth Control contradiction episode of //House// + //Skintime//. 

My last XOXOs for the evening. =(. That girl needs her sleep badly, and I'm glad someone has melatonin left (since it seems to help some folks). I stayed up as late as my eyes would allow me waiting for a possible Artgroup meeting. [[TTTOTW]].
