> The primary function of socialization and culture is to refine people into restraint for their self-serving, animalistic desires.

> But what happens when digital algorithms of social media carve a "you-shaped hole" for you to fall into? That's the goal of the attention monopolists, to manufacture a digital place that fits exactly as you are, to grip you as long as possible. That generates tens of thousands of cultures whose values are INVERTED to a functioning society. And it must be that way, because the only way to mesmerize people indefinitely is with base gratification. Instead of becoming "well adjusted" to other people we become more extreme versions of ourselves.

> Incel as a culture exists now, where the norm is to reject responsibility for your functioning and self-worth as a human being, and the only value for you to aspire to is revenge. A culture like that is not refining, it's endlessly degenerating toward our most shameful and reflexive rationalizations. Any system which rewards people for less and less discipline and more and more extreme ideas like that is pathological, and I would say evil. Now, every paranoid delusion, resentful sentiment, one dimensional idea has an entire culture based around it. A person thinks they have THE answer to the world's problems and 'poof', they get to live in a reality where their thoughts are unanimously validated by their new friends as meaningful and true.

> Sanity isn't simply your brain as a punch bowl filled with the proper mix of chemicals. One way to think about it is that sanity is outsourced to the network of people around you. Everybody you interact with is clueing you in to how they expect you to act through a plethora of verbal and nonverbal cues. We constantly adjust ourselves toward this aggregate of norms. Social media bombards you with not just qualitative feedback of praise and ridicule, but also quantitative feedback of an objective measure of your contribution and conformance to the culture. We are all being shaped by enormously persuasive and unprecedented forces.

> Ideas that diverge from the established narrative of a digital culture are suppressed more effectively than any flesh and blood totalitarian government could dream of. In the exclusion of external viewpoints, the stated value system (often a single train of thought) runs to the unchallenged and final conclusion of it's beliefs. Which allows for the abdication of personal responsibility and ultimate demonization of people, human norms, and the foundational systems of society.

> One definition of humanity is our restraining or generous conscious effort toward the wellbeing of the network of people around us. That's what we've been selling to inhabit a digitally gratifying space, where everything we think is validated as reality. For now only the most self-absorbed and desperate for blame people have lost it completely.

> But consider that if there's a billion people on the internet. And tech giants, who track every click and tap we've ever made on the internet, have a couple thousand data points per person (speaking very conservatively). Then that's trillions of microscopic details of the autonomous functioning of our consciousness. After correlating these trillions of points between each other, and between each billion person, with their exponentially more powerful computers and algorithms, then we are going to be sucked more deeply into our own you-shaped hole. As we fall deeper into these ideological holes we will become more twisted and starved of the discipline essential for joy while losing consciousness into a haze of animalistic pleasure. It's barely been a decade since social media came to existence in a viral form, so where are we going to be 40 years from now?

>The primary function of socialization and culture is to refine people into restraint for their self-serving, animalistic desires.

With this first sentence you give us your full ideological affiliation.

ONLY in a technocratic, totalitarian society socialization and culture have ascribed function, because they are the tool of power. 

In normal societies socialization and culture have no purpose other then extend the will of individuals, whatever that will might be. Every individual performs those behaviors with completely private reasons or goals in mind, or simply as a way to kill time. Life, individual or social, does not have any function. Function is something we ascribe to tools, not human beings, societies. 

>Sanity isn't simply your brain as a punch bowl filled with the proper mix of chemicals. One way to think about it is that sanity is outsourced to the network of people around you. Everybody you interact with is clueing you in to how they expect you to act through a plethora of verbal and nonverbal cues. 

This is not definition of sanity. This is a definition of narcissistic paranoia. No man ever thinks about adjusting himself to the norms. He sets & defends the norms in dialogue with his community. The technocratic regime though would sure like to make you a self-censoring slave paranoiac, but this is a definition of insanity, not sanity. You are literally pulling newspeak on us.

Quality of all logic rests with the definitions. Yours are clearly malicious, anti human & anti social. You definitions clearly remove intrinsic value from society or culture, rendering them only tools for your ideology. So when someone like you calls out this or that culture "pathological", or frame self-serving as something intrinsically amoral, you clearly have problem with human values as a whole. You wear you ideology on your sleeve.

So stop bothering people with your shallow agitprop.

The main flaw of internet is ease of anonymity, which gives antisocial aparatchiks like you convenient cover, since you preach self-censorship but are sure glad to completely avoid it. I'm sure you would never write that under your full name. Slime is just oozing from your post.

Still striving to escape nihilism there, Sir Piotr? I admire that.

Why would I, even if it was an applicable metaphor, which it isn't, want to "escape" nihilism? It's neutral/positive fact of language. Technocracy is not nihilistic, because to realize nihilism one has to perform intellectual operations. Technocrats are naturalists subordinate to the same rudimentary mechanics as bio-chemistry, echoing natural stupidity and obedience to external conditions, as well as maintained by simple loops of satisfaction.

It is those same technocrats that coined the idea of nature being disorderly and free in a negative sense, in a classic neurotic disavowal to create positive meaning to their idiotic classifications, their eternal obedience. But in fact both nature and technocracy are of the same strict order, inertia of life gravitating towards repetition.

If anything, I'd like to escape nature, and the fact this existence does not allow me to is my eternal source of anguish. Nature is a prison, and all naturalists are learned in prison logic, prison values and virtues, prison rules, leashed by their stupid pointless survival.

Isn't it sad that in absence of your own name you have to use mine in effort to make an impression? Among others one thing which differs animals form humans is that they don't know the value of names.
