*[[2020.05.24 - YTDL: Mannequin]]
** What did you think of the WOOP project?
*[[2020/05/24 -- Life Log: Far Too Short]]
** I enjoy our 1-on-1's. They weren't boring for me. We'll think about how to make them less boring.
** It was also much shorter, something like 5 hours. 
*[[2020/05/24 -- Antipleonasm Analysis: Cats, On The Other Hand]]
** That will be an unpopular position to hold in many circles. It is far more elegant appearing to agree to niceness everywhere and to everything without considering the implications and contradictions. 
*[[2020/05/24 -- Prompted Introspection: Meat of CULTURE]]
** I'm a differentiationist here, so I'm fine with the claim. It's important for you to know that a lot of WEIRD individuals aiming to virtue signal will push back here. 
** Note that growing meat in a lab in an efficient manner could be extremely good for humans as well. I simply don't know enough to say how it could play out, but I would not be surprised to find it cleaner, cheaper, more readily available to everyone on the planet (most humans do not get to eat meat in high quantities), and better for the environment. 
** The question is oddly phrased. You might want to interrogate that.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** [[missing_ranges]] needs a filetype and some tagging.
** [[2017/05/25 -- The Best at One Thing]] is hilarious.
*** "But, I need to hit 250 words, so press on we shall!" in particular. =)
** Seems like [[2018/05/25 -- Deep Reading Log]] should be in [[1984]], yeah? 
*** I would love to see all that tagging and transcluding done.
**** Yes, the wiki is shockingly functional even when unstructured or haphazardly metadata-ed, but you'll be glad you took the time to have projects worked out.
** Commander can be used to automatically tag. You should do it, yo.
*** You keep ignoring what I'm telling you here. =(.
