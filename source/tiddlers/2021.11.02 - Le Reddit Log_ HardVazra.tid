Why do people always look through your post history? (self.TheoryOfReddit)

I’m new to Reddit, having mostly used 4chan before. It baffles me how much people look at someone’s post history. It seems like every single time I make a post remotely outside the norm, people will look through my post history and reply with things completely unrelated to what I actually posted. Why is this? It feels like a creepy invasion of privacy to me.
