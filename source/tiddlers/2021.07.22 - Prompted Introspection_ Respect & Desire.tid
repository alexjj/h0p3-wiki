title: 2021.07.22 - Prompted Introspection: Respect & Desire

!! Would you rather increase the amount that people respect you, or increase the amount they desire you?

What kind of [[respect|2014.02.17 - Bare Metal Recognition and Appraisal Respect]] do you have in mind? What parts of me are they desiring? Qua [[W5H]], [[gfwiwcgws]]? It seems like any form of respect is partially constituted by a molecular state of desire of, for, toward, or regarding a relation to a given object. I demand the respect owed to all persons, and nothing less; and, anything more than that (though it's far more complex than initially meets the eye), I do not have a right to. In accordance with that (and my vocation), I have a habit of forcing people's hands here. Whether they are friend or foe, they'll have at least an appraisal respect, often ultimately accompanied by repulsion.<<ref "h">> I prefer we are moral, setting aside the capriciousness and corrupt egoism of desires when they conflict with what is obligated, acting from duty. That is the only categorical answer. I suggest that fittingly respecting any individual entails having respected all persons correctly. To have violated one is to have violated them all. Increasing the amount that any person is being morally respected is a service to us all. But, insofar as they can be peeled apart, it's my duty to say: not all suffering is equal, and I'm not being disrespected nearly as much as the global poor and future generations, and if you [[aim]] to respect me, you're gonna respect them (and sacrificially so at that). I'm not the priority, and if you can read this sentence: you probably aren't either.

<<footnotes "h" "Hilariously, often in virtue of reckoning with the fact they aren't nihilistically the center of the universe (and, I mean, beyond the socially-regulated varieties of narcissism where it's uncouth to express it in some forms), that we have to serve something objectively external to us, and neither of us are sufficient as ends. As a paranoid autist, analytic philosopher, and human-safecracker+chickensexer, I'm somewhat an expert in picking out why people have negative reactions to morality (at this point, I've been having this discussion longer than most of my interlocutors have been alive); I judge everyone I meet in virtue of it. I'm looking for it your first ten sentences to me, and everyone who knows me well enough knows every conversation is about it. It's a sacrament.">>
