*** lmao. got'em. The reduction of justification to internalism inevitability gives us nothing. This is fuel for reactionaries.

*** Nothing even close to hyperinflation. I'm likely wrong to have worried as much there, or at least I'm wrong about the timescale (it could take a while). Why? Are there somehow two different economies? Is it just money being pumped into the capitalist's market without absurdly influencing the plebs? Is it Japan again? Still appear long-term fucked.

*** 95% accuracy is hard to beat. As usual, the justification is lacking (as it was for Saint Marx himself), but that goes with almost every serious Marxist I've seen (a flaw I aim to be quick to forgive in this case), and this is merely vidya on the Youtubes (fleshing out is improbable in this format). I need to recommend this feller to more folks.
