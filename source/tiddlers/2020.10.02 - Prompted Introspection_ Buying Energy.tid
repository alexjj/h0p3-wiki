title: 2020.10.02 - Prompted Introspection: Buying Energy

!! Write about something you would still buy if it cost twice as much as it costs today.

There's plenty of inelastic demand in my life. I'd still buy energy even if it cost twice as much. I've had to before ([[Thailand]] was fascinating in this respect). I wouldn't buy as much as I do now though. An $800 bill to heat the house means we just won't heat the house except to preserve the pipes and heat food. [[monster-16]] is going to get her juice though, as will everyone's computers. I keep solar lanterns, with enough to maintain a rotation, but I'd still need energy for other light too. Our tools need energy.
