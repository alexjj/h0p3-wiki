Started the new job this week. It's been.... Interesting. Minimal work on helicopters. Mostly computer training. Pretty lazy job  when there is nothing to work on. But suppose to have an aircraft in next week.

Trying to figure out how high school will work for [[j3d1h]].

But, been here for 100 days now or so, and feeling increasingly settled.

Coworkers are cool. Much tamer crowed than I'm used to working around. Plenty of trash talking but nothing near what I've grown accustomed to.
Apr 10 6:03pm
That's awesome.
Apr 10 6:03pm
Glad yall are feeling settled. It's a very weird time to be alive right now.
Apr 10 6:03pm
Hopefully, it will be a pleasant place all around.

Very weird time. Like electric anxiety.

I am interested in how this plays out and how quickly the global and US economy recovers.

Thankfully I am still considered essential besides the fact I wanna be home with my family! Lol. They are now transporting covid 19 patients in our helicopters so my exposure just increased greatly.
Apr 10 6:12pm
True that.
Apr 10 6:13pm
How do you handle what might be contaminated?
Apr 10 6:13pm
Med crew is suppose to clean cabin. We wear gloves and clean cabin. It's all kinda dumb.
