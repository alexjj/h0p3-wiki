<<footnotes "a" "And, I'm pretty sure you're a bad person if you don't like soupy soup (setting aside the standard ontological questions [did you know you can sit on a soup and make it a chair?]). Also, like many soups, this one is relatively cheap and makes for excellent leftovers or can be stored longer-term.">>

<<footnotes "i" "I like them fine and crunchy to contrast with the softer mealiness of the lentils and the mouth-watering flesh morsels I masticate.">>
