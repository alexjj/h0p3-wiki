!! Write a paragraph summarizing each person's week given the wikis:

*** My mother is right, I didn't actually prove it, I still think a mathematiction could prove me wrong. (And probably already has, I just haven't seen it.) I have been loving working on RRP code, it's been a blast. The week after this one I might work more on the packages. I failed to have "difs" for my RRP code, thank goodness my father knows it was improved. I think I did about 35-50% of my mothers work.
** j3d1h
*** You seem to be harder on yourself earlier in the week. Work on that, please, I don't think you deserve a lot of what you tell yourself. Your notes (in general, but I mean notage) are good! I think you should clean them up afterwards, and try not to directly quote me. I repeat myself too often for that to be your quickest route. Even if you weren't sure how to present, your Empedocles presentation notes were very good! If you ever need help, I'm happy to hear you present before it's time, and give some feedback.
** k0sh3k
*** I think, beginning next week, I'll have you all keep a "School Assignments for [Week Dates]", so we can tell what y'all are doing week over week. Your notes on Magic Numbers were good - although I want to caution you that you don't know enough about math to really argue with mathematicians; right now, you should be listening and learning more than you are arguing. I think you should continue in My Brain and Learning; you also need to be taking more notes. I wish I could "see" more of your day in your wiki - you don't really tell us what you do each day. 
** h0p3
*** [[1uxb0x]] has been working On [[RRP Code Stuff]], and I'm wondering if I should build an Robot RPed World with him (seems like a dope concept to me). I have a dumb character idea that I [[hope]] he wouldn't mind. I need to understand more of what he is doing. We'll see. He's been thinking about jumping into mathematics, and I think that's a fantastic idea (I'd even trade [[Φιλοσοφική ανάλυση]] pried from my almost cold dead hands for it). He is gradually improving on interpretation and presentation through perseverance. We were lucky to have his research on [[Empedocles]], and I'm beyond excited to engage in our upcoming [[urban-survival.tdl]] with him. He finished his chores, and I am grateful. It's been an expensive and worthy week with him.

* [[j3d1h]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I don't know how to flip the mana section, I'll ask you to help me with that later. I think sundays for us are just sleeping in days, where we get to sleep to 10 or 11. Thank you for helping me present on my philosopher. I'm sad I don't have anything close to what you had for brain and learning. I think your presentation was amazing.
** j3d1h
*** I've enjoyed making the appearance controls quite a bit. It still needs some work - a lot of work - but it's definitely getting closer. Most of my school and wiki were very good this week, it seems! I'm particularly proud of my Parmenides presentation, it went well. I'm going to have even more fun drafting the RP rewrite, soon enough. The confidence has really helped me this week, and out of seemingly nowhere at that.
** k0sh3k
*** How very Ood. I'm glad you you seem to be talking to yourself more in you wiki, and I'm glad to see you talking about your art. I like seeing more about what you do each day! I like what you've done with My Brain and Learning, so far. Is it being helpful? It is 7:30 and you have had no day today!
** h0p3
*** [[j3d1h]] worked on tooling for a makeover for her wiki (she's thinking about collaborating with [[Sphygmus]]). Her work on [[Parmenides]] was impressive both in content and method; I've never met someone her age who can stand there with me. She's been on fire in her wiki this week. She plans better than I do sometimes (I'm jelly). It's been her best week of school I can remember in a long time.

* [[k0sh3k]]
** 1uxb0x
*** I'm happy that you got a day off this week. It sucsk that you have so many meetings. Thank you for dealing with our mistakes in school for this week. I really like your RCL this week. I think your week has been okay.
** j3d1h
*** Do you think working from home is helping you write more in your wiki? It certainly seems like it, though you don't seem any less drained, most of the time. You've been reading a whole lot recently. I should start reading as much as you do on a regular basis - it's not like I don't have plenty of books //to// read. Kent Cupcake is teh best original OC character, donut steel. I didn't know you lost some of your memories after you died, that's fascinating! You don't have a good history with medicine, do you?
** k0sh3k
*** Kent Cupcake: Private Eye will be the title of my upcoming children's detective novel, featuring a kid who tracks down missing baked goods or something. I had a very productive week, and I'm glad I was chosen to join the phase3 taskforce (which has a fancy name but it's too long to use, screw that); but I'm really not looking forward to daily 8:30am meetings, holy chicken strips, Batman. 
** h0p3
*** [[k0sh3k]] elegantly delivers wisdom with clarity and charity. [[Chapter 23 - "Be Doers of the Word"]] picks out the balance of doxa and praxis like so few do correctly. Warts and all, she's a genius, and she's the [[good]] kind. I think she is like a prodigious waterbender to my firebending; she's a [[leet]] constructor. Our offspring are lucky to have her as a teacher. She's been tired, and I can see work has been taking quite a toll on her too.

*** I enjoyed working on the cancel stylesheet, though I'm mildly upset that it broke. That will be a handy thing for me to be able to spin up quickly. Lojban seems very cool, and I'm excited to at least learn more, if not learn the language myself! Your maymays are fantastic, thank you for sharing.
** k0sh3k
*** Good Lord, you had terrible teachers. I can tell you had a lot of ups and downs with the kids this week. I'm glad you enjoyed Debatable. I can tell you're excited about Lojban, even if I still don't understand it well enough to share your enthusiasm. It might be a good idea to track vaping, just to see how/if it affects your writing/communicating with others. 
** h0p3
*** [[h0p3]] has been thinking about many people in his life. He's done what heavy-lifting he could. [[Monthly Auditable]]s went well enough, and he really needs to graft. He's incredibly excited about [[urban-survival.tdl]], even if it is a flop. He's been pushing hard on them interwebs and stubbin' his penis like a good neckbeard.
