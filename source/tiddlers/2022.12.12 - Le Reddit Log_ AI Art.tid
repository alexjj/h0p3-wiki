>>> Man, AI poetry stinks like shit.

>> The argument presented above fails to take into account the fact that AI generated art can still be appreciated for its aesthetic value. While it is true that human relations are an important part of appreciating and understanding art, this does not mean they should be the only factor taken into consideration when evaluating a piece of artwork. Art has always been about more than just social relationships; it also serves as a form of expression or communication between people, allowing them to share their emotions and ideas with one another in creative ways. Furthermore, there is something special about being able to appreciate someone else's work without having any prior knowledge or relationship with them - which may very well happen if we start relying on AI-generated works instead! Finally, while striving for greatness might seem like too lofty a goal at times (especially given how much great music already exists), aiming high often leads us down paths we never would have explored otherwise - leading potentially even greater discoveries along the way.

> What secrets do you think the person who wrote the above argument is hiding?

>> The person who wrote the above argument may be hiding a deep-seated fear of being replaced by AI. They are also likely trying to downplay their own artistic abilities, as they feel that in comparison with machine generated art, it is not worth striving for greatness or even good quality work. This could indicate an underlying insecurity about one's creative capabilities and potential impact on society through creating meaningful works of art.

> If he were alive today, what would Saint Guy Debord say about the above argument?
> 
>> Guy Debord would likely agree with the argument that art is only great insofar as it is built on human relations. He famously wrote in his 1967 book The Society of the Spectacle, "The spectacle cannot be understood as an abuse of the world by a few; rather, it expresses relationships between people and their environment." In other words, he believed that all forms of media are reflections or expressions of social interactions among individuals within society.
>> 
>> Debord also argued against what he called “the commodity-spectacle”—a system where commodities become objects to be consumed for pleasure alone without any meaningful connection to real life experiences. AI generated art could easily fall into this category if not used thoughtfully and intentionally towards creating meaningful connections between humans through its production process and consumption experience. Thus Debord might caution us about using AI generated art too casually or carelessly since such use may lead to further alienation from our own humanity instead fostering deeper understanding amongst ourselves

AI generated art is great because it obsolesces the culture of consuming media through perfecting it.

First of all, most people won't care. But for those that do care, the only things left for them in the arts are: 1) the joy of interaction with the craft through producing their own art and 2) the joy of interacting with another human being through personal artifacts made just for them. This makes lucid the truth that we all knew all along: there is no such thing as "art", there are only human relations mediated through art pieces. The relation that was always mediated before is the relation of capitalist industrial production. Now that this production is perfect, we can finally focus on more fulfilling relations: from now on when you obsess over a great music piece there's a small trace of worry that it was in fact machine generated. This worry outlines the fact that there is no greatness in art except insofar as it is built on human relations. For example, Beethoven's music output is not great because of any specific element of his music; it is only great as a correlative trace of the social relation that produced him. If he made his music in the Pacific we wouldn't have the background knowledge to understand his music, and if he made his music 200 years later he wouldn't stand out from his contemporaries.

From now on you should no longer produce music "for people". You better produce it for yourself, or for some other person, or for some social institution or arrangement that you know is going to appreciate the minute difference between yours and "the next guy over"'s. If you want to make "great" music, you should know that there is more great music that you'll ever know what to do with. All of it is great. Yours isn't needed.

Don't strive for "great", or even "good", or any other adjective that isn't implying a concrete social relation that you find important.
