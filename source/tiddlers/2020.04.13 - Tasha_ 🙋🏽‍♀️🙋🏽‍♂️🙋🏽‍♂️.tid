Good. I'm glad.

We're doing well. Grinding hard in school.
Apr 13 2:40pm
Thinking about gardening.
Apr 13 2:40pm
Awesome
Apr 13 2:41pm
We are all home as of today
Apr 13 2:42pm
Can’t say we have any plans so far just going with the flow
Apr 13 2:42pm
Yup. Makes sense. I hope you get some chill family time in. Not an ideal vacation, but there's something like a break of being together.
Apr 13 2:43pm
Yea definitely going to relax

Thinking about getting a salvia divinorum plant.
Apr 13 2:52pm
Wth is that 😳
Apr 13 3:37pm
It's a psychedelic plant. Never tried it before.
Apr 13 7:32pm

Gotcha and in what way will it be used!?
Apr 14 9:45am
I can't vape it. Requires a high temperature. Either has to be smoked or I need an extraction.

Apr 14 9:47am
Sounds interesting
Apr 14 9:47am
If I do have the chance, I'll let you know if it was worthwhile.
Apr 14 10:10am
If you do have the chance? Idk if you don’t plan on surviving it that it’s worth it 😳
Apr 14 10:13am
Lol. =)
Apr 14 10:14am
I meant that it will take to time acquire the plant. I want to keep it as a house plant.
Apr 14 10:14am
Gotta grow it and stuff (and, I don't have a green thumb like you do).
