title: 2020.05.27 - Prompted Introspection: Little Trust

!! Who is someone you trust little if at all?

[[2019.01.03 - Prompted Introspection: Who I Trust Least]] is all fine and dandy. Got 'em. C'mon, [[h0p3]], let's try to be practical with that theory. I'm glad to expand the scope of the question. This question is somehow less scary than picking out who I trust. I think the answer should be surprising in some sense then. There's too many to choose from. I'd like to steer away from those who are in obvious [[power]] then. 

[[Brad]] is a solid example. Of course I saw a bitter person who clearly had exploited others. I also saw that he might have changed. Some of the moves he made were correct, and surprisingly so. My antenna was too generous though. 

Yet, I feel like one can build trust with me if they want it. It's expensive in some cases (extravagantly so sometimes), but it's doable.
