>> So in broad and inaccurate strokes, autism causes one to be better at observing things, whereas normies are better at being dictated to?

>> That certainly explains why it's a "disorder;" it basically makes you immune to like 70% of bullshit, and most social protocol is mostly bullshit anyway. It's pretty common for normies' reasoning to be "Well, everyone else is doing it; so we should be doing it too!" which I imagine is pretty difficult to get along with when one can see the rest of the herd running off the edge of a cliff.

>> Also, the bit about schizophrenics explains why schizos're usually nervous wrecks prone to caving into social pressure all the time. I'd be shaking like a chihuahua too if my hallucinations were the only ones talking sense. (not that I have any)

> ''''

>> Have you turned the question around? What is NOT Autism?

>> "Difficulty conforming to social pressure is a sign of autism" THEN any type of trauma can be 'Autism'

>> But also side effects from 'chemicals' (chemical trauma?) can be placed in the same corner?

>> Maybe Technology is traumatic? :-D

> ''''

>> I'm really curious to know more on this explanation. Some of the terms you've used I've not heard in this context so it's a bit hard for me to understand.

>>> Autism is a form of aberrant precision in which one's epistemic confidence intervals are too low because bottom-up sense-data cannot handshake with top-down models unless they’re almost exactly the same

>> What do you mean by epistemic confidence intervals? Or phenomenologies?

>>> and attention itself might just be understood as a localized narrowing of confidence intervals

>> Similarly, I don't quite know what is meant by this on a deep enough level I feel.

>>> and instinctively perceive strong self-other boundaries

>> Based on context found later, I'm guessing this means people with Autism have more of a sense of separation between themselves and other people? Does this also include their environment? I've read up on ego-death as I'm very interested in the experiences people have while taking psychedelics, so I'm wondering if there's some kind of connection here; in the sense that the daily experience of someone with Autism is the opposite of the experience while undergoing ego-death (that being the removal of the ego and the belief that things and sensory input are happening to an 'I').

>>> Bayesian equation (though there can be comorbidity)

>> I've heard of Bayesian equations/filtering for things like statistics, but don't fully understand what it is. As for the comorbidity, is this in reference to something like an "Autismophrenia" kind of neurodivergency?

>>> Where the schizophrenic may be prone to thinking the universe is telling them something from coincidences (often a useful trait in socializing) or leaping to conclusions from the tiniest clues in someone's body language, the autist may see the world through such a mechanistic rule-based lens (lost in the byzantine chaos of partial-information games on a complex physical substrate) that they can't take a hint and need to be explicitly told.

>> Is it possible that someone with Autism who is attempting to "mask" or overcorrect because of the way their brain works may find themselves also leaping to conclusions when it comes to socializing? For instance, they understand their shortcomings and replay social situations in their mind to then apply their mental model of socializing (or use pattern recognition/attempt to find patterns) in an effort to better understand/ensure they aren't missing something a neurotypical would've caught onto immediately?

>> Also, what is meant by "byzantine chaos of partial-information games on a complex physical substrate"?

>>> It may be the case that autistic people have higher perceptual intelligence than their other types of intelligence

>> What is perceptual intelligence in this context? You mentioned, as a metaphor, that people with Autism have a wide sensory bus. Is that what is meant by intelligence here? The ability to notice more of the details that a neurotypical mind might filter out, thus not bringing it to conscious attention?

>> Thank you for this post by the way. Very informative, and has helped describe this condition in ways I haven't seen elsewhere.

> ''''

>> Your comparison of autists and schizophrenics confuses me somewhat; I have moments of both "leaping to conclusions from the tiniest clues in someone's body language" and "feeling one with the universe" etc and "the autist may see the world through such a mechanistic rule-based lens (lost in the byzantine chaos of partial-information games on a complex physical substrate) that they can't take a hint and need to be explicitly told".

>> That is, my diagnosis is schizophrenia, and my "similar to autism" moments are likely because of willing to behave that way so to prevent painful mistakes, so this makes sense.

> ''''

>> This is very well articulated! Must look again later...

> Autism is a form of aberrant precision in which one's epistemic confidence intervals are too low because bottom-up sense-data cannot handshake with top-down models unless they’re almost exactly the same. For an autist, their top-down models lose their ability to "smooth over" bottom-up information, and their phenomenologies become overrun by random noise that neurotypical predictive processing would have filtered out. An autistic person, therefore, is constantly surprised by the small differences between their sense data and models. Their brain flags these differences as being important enough to disrupt other perceptual processes, often even bubbling up into consciousness for attention (and attention itself might just be understood as a localized narrowing of confidence intervals). Hence, autistic people are often drowned in attending to a sea of details that neurotypical people would not experience.

> Autists seek routine, rules, and stim to have more predictable environments, and they tend to avoid even slightly noisy environments that overwhelm their sensory inputs. Much of the world remains a chaotic mystery of uninterpretable clues to the autist. Likewise, autistic people may dislike social interactions because of how much uncertainty obtains in even simple social encounters. Autistic people will tend to have difficulties modeling the minds of others, and instinctively perceive strong self-other boundaries. Unpredictability of others and the world can be quite painful.

> Autism may be the opposite of schizophrenia as a failure mode in the brain's applied simulation of the Bayesian equation (though there can be comorbidity). Genetic risks for one often decrease the risks for the other (though the genes that increase the risk of autism are also disproportationately genes that increase intelligence). Where the autist has strong self-other boundaries, the schizophrenic has weakened ones (they feel may feel "one" with the universe, in a sense). Where the autist may be pathologically rational but uncreative, the schizophrenic may be creative but irrational. Where the schizophrenic may be prone to thinking the universe is telling them something from coincidences (often a useful trait in socializing) or leaping to conclusions from the tiniest clues in someone's body language, the autist may see the world through such a mechanistic rule-based lens (lost in the byzantine chaos of partial-information games on a complex physical substrate) that they can't take a hint and need to be explicitly told.

> These neurotribal mutations need not necessarily be mental disorders. It depends on the context. It may be the case that autistic people have higher perceptual intelligence than their other types of intelligence (an uneven distribution of marbles in their baskets), and while they may have the intelligence to build tall towers, the foundations for those towers may be too weak. In my experience, high-functioning autism entails a high sense-data bus throughput with too much uncertainty in my models to make sense of it all, which must be compensated for through the endless pursuit of increasingly accurate models. In my opinion, I require far more data points, examples, sample sizes, and iterations to arrive at the fitting model than a similarly intelligent person without autism. In trade, however, once I have acquired a model, I can sometimes perceive, infer, or make explicit more with less effort than the neurotypical.

I have been trying to figure this out and not a single source actually explains what autism is.

Here's a list of the unhelpful answers:

"Autism is a mental disorder caused by differences in the brain."
And? What are these differences? How are these differences a disorder?

"Autism is a developmental disorder that causes unusual behavior."
In which ways does autism make one's behavior deviate from normalcy?

Sometimes they'll say something to the effect of:

"Autism often causes X, Y and Z behavior..."
...But they don't explain why, or what the unifying root of autism is.

And every single time, it's the same song and dance that pussy-foots around the actual question. Do they just never want to answer what autism actually is?

Saying stuff like "Having an intense interest in something is a sign of autism," or "Difficulty making eye-contact is a sign of autism," or "Difficulty conforming to social pressure is a sign of autism," don't tell me what autism is, but they do tell me that you'll get labelled as an autist for not conforming to certain customs.

Is that really all that autism is? That you're not easily swayed into getting along for its own sake? Because if so, that really makes it sound less like a disability and more like a base standard that the normals fall short of, to be honest. (Kind of makes me envious, really.)

Anyway, I'm asking here on aether, because being technologically literate makes you like 95% likely to have autism. So I'm told.
