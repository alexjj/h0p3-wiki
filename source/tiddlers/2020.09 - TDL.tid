!! Audit:

* I can't believe I've forgotten so much of what I've done this month. Jesus. 
* We did stuff.
* A lot of single-word [[title.Title]]s. Curled up. 
* Still lost trying to find a way for my offspring. 
* You relaxed on cooking. Costco.
* Substanceless days were useful attempts.
* I'm glad to see that you made your wife's landing smoother. She definitely felt the difference.
* I need moar jokes in here. I never have enough. It makes me smile to see them sprankled throughout. y so srs?
* Camping sadly failed. No one wanted to. I think it might be a bad think for my offspring's intelligence and experience. 
** I'm trying not to push unless I absolutely must.
* Interesting to see how the mancave idea continues to evolve. It turned out to be something we're taking into account in a buying a home.
* You've done a good job getting your offspring to practice cooking more. `/thumbs-up`
* I really don't like our Landlord. We told her it was broken, and she acted like it wasn't. Does not give a fuck. We are just meat to her.
** I'm trying to throw her a bone here too. Give it a couple years and her central cooling is going to break down.
* We're continuing to reign in our spending. She doesn't have the same intuitions that I do. Very different upbringing here. She's come a really long way too. I'm [[grateful]].
* Multiple walks have been dope. 
* You haven't been begging/planning sex as much. //Skintime// has been an important gap-filler. 
** Kinda think [[TTP]]s could be modified here soon enough.
* I'm already missing the watermelon. We didn't get as many this year, but we probably had a few dozen. 
* I'm the in-betweener glue.
* Feels like this one is dying. =(. Ugh. Well. As usual, it is the most embarrassing part of my wiki to me.
