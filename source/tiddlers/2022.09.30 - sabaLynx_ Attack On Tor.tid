[14:35:57] saharsedigh: hello
[20:14:23] h0p3: Yo
[20:14:25] h0p3: How are you doing today?
[22:41:02] saharsedigh: hello;
[22:41:10] saharsedigh: everything good?

[pending] : 2022-09-30
[00:12:02] saharsedigh: :D
[00:20:38] h0p3: lmao
[00:20:49] h0p3: well, I'll leave it up longer
[00:21:21] h0p3: Try out Whonix if you get the chance. Resilio Sync is fast. 
[00:22:03] h0p3: They are mutable torrents of synchronized directories, and I've found serious competition in this place. 
[00:22:10] h0p3: (something I hope to rectify one day)
[01:27:57] h0p3: I can't say that everything is good, but I'll say my day has been good.
[01:47:49] saharsedigh: I don't know your setup. but I want to do a test. http://i5qvk6kcblmnad2cwd6biqgi3q7plttzzikrqeukny3dlqpgtvkamvqd.onion/
[01:48:35] saharsedigh: that link is the whole collection of Darts you gave me. (all the goodies)
[01:49:06] saharsedigh: Would it be much to give the same directory as retroshare collection?
[01:49:54] saharsedigh: I want to test the best delivery system in our machines?
[01:50:02] h0p3: Makes sense.
[01:50:15] saharsedigh: also I have a Mac system free at the moment.
[01:50:46] saharsedigh: Would It do the job? For Whonix?
[01:51:01] h0p3: I believe it should work on it, yes. 
[01:51:06] saharsedigh: I will go each route that you recommand!
[01:51:25] saharsedigh: either RS Collection OR Whonix
[01:51:43] h0p3: Well, bad news is that my custom Whonix does not appear to be working correctly at the moment!
[01:51:45] h0p3: Just checked.
[01:52:20] saharsedigh: Also tell me if any other way is possible.?!@
[01:52:44] h0p3: MuWire is another way.
[01:52:49] saharsedigh: {{Well, bad news is that my custom Whonix does not appear to be working correctly at the moment!}} >> No Rush.
[01:53:32] h0p3: nm, just needed to restart gateway, appears operational again, for now* =D.
[01:53:56] h0p3: I'd like to test that with you.
[01:54:03] saharsedigh: ðŸ˜† love ATM part.
[01:54:12] saharsedigh: I am game
[01:55:05] h0p3: I keep my syncs fully separate from what retroshare can access. I can just copy and paste the directory (though all the parts are already shared, they aren't in one nice directory).
[01:55:36] saharsedigh: tor rx is about 9.2KB  right now
[01:55:44] h0p3: Yuck
[01:56:00] h0p3: We can do better than that
[01:56:17] saharsedigh: {{(though all the parts are already shared, they aren't in one nice directory).}} >> That would do. RSCollection won't work at way.
[01:56:23] h0p3: I currently am not at max upload speed either.
[01:56:41] saharsedigh: ahhh; I wish Tox had reply option like TelegrAM]: [01:57:01] h0p3: It does, I believe. 
[01:57:07] h0p3: I don't know how to make it do that. =D. 
[01:57:30] saharsedigh: It seems tor network is heavy under attack....
[01:57:51] saharsedigh: has been for sometime.
[01:58:50] h0p3: Yes, indeed.
[01:58:51] saharsedigh: tell you waht! Just make a RS Collection of an small portion of what is available about 1G or 2.
[01:59:35] h0p3: You should be able to see what I'm sharing, right? /mnt/m16-new-storage/public-share/temp/sabaLynx
[01:59:42] h0p3: then you can pick out exactly what you want. 
[02:00:27] saharsedigh: In Files?
[02:00:32] h0p3: Aye
[02:01:00] saharsedigh: In friends file?
[02:02:11] h0p3: Should work, yeah
[02:03:41] h0p3: I'm topping out at 80kb/s on this one download (testing https://keet.io).
[02:03:46] h0p3: Ugly
[02:05:37] h0p3: I appreciate your testing file transfer options out with me. I assume you are a busy person, and this might not be nearly as fun as standard programming.
[02:07:39] saharsedigh: I don't have you in there. You appear to be offline. I send you an Retroshare email. Plz connect to both links/IDs. I hit you at the same time at my end.
[02:07:59] saharsedigh: I appreciate you help.
[02:09:17] saharsedigh: *your help
[02:13:37] h0p3: Hrm. Retroshare showed me some activity from you, Tunnel is pending again...
[02:13:53] saharsedigh: Wait
[02:14:58] saharsedigh: Let me restart my machine
[03:46:46] saharsedigh: ðŸ˜“ðŸ˜µ Hi back.
[03:47:09] saharsedigh: that was something. all things went down here. all the way to my router
[03:47:23] saharsedigh: I lost my wifi connection too
[03:55:37] h0p3: =D
[03:55:44] h0p3: Sorry. I know that feel.
[03:56:00] h0p3: Our interwebs went down today in the household. 4 of us almost died. :P
[03:58:28] saharsedigh: I hold my breath when that happens. but it usually don't help I get dizzy
[03:58:46] saharsedigh: ðŸ˜´ðŸ˜„
[08:26:03] saharsedigh: Did you ever tried ZeroNet or IPFS?
[08:49:27] saharsedigh: I see you online but I cant connect to you. something is wrong!
[pending] h0p3: I have tried ZeroNet and IPFS. Both are interesting tools. 
[pending] h0p3: Something is wrong! Lol. I think Retroshare's connectivity is still flawed while routed over Tor.

SabaS3digh [11:14 PM]: now what?
SabaS3digh [11:15 PM]: you gave me a hash-key of some sort. Should I import that?
h0p3 [11:15 PM]: You might try ipfs-desktop
h0p3 [11:15 PM]: makes it a bit simpler, imho
SabaS3digh [11:15 PM]: it is that.
SabaS3digh [11:15 PM]: the desktop
h0p3 [11:16 PM]: (this process has been hilariously sad, btw...it's 2022, and we're struggling to move a batch of files anonymously when governments don't want us to)
h0p3 [11:16 PM]: Import "From IPFS"
SabaS3digh [11:16 PM]: to put it nicely.

[21:41:37] saharsedigh: hi
[21:42:32] saharsedigh: I lost tor and qtox connections for about 12hrs
[22:21:13] h0p3: Yo. Sorry, man. The network has been under attack.
[22:21:32] h0p3: We could avoid using Tor, if you prefer. 
[22:37:24] saharsedigh: Hello back
[22:37:30] h0p3: Yo =)
[22:40:37] saharsedigh: No; I prefer tor. Beside It was very strange thing. even meek bridges didn't connect. I change carrier and got connected. even then no data did exchange... I even went as far as Reset my router.... I just got connected again... I did think you left or something but It was my not getting through... I was something I tell you....
[22:41:26] h0p3: That sounds frustrating.
[22:41:45] h0p3: Especially if you've got critical work to get done that can't be done offline.
[22:41:51] saharsedigh: I went and Install ZeroNet. The idea is very intersting but how much secure and anon is it I don't know
[22:44:20] saharsedigh: I think there is a shif in the geo-political world happening right now... too much happening in too many places to be coincidence.
[22:45:24] h0p3: I am, unfortunately, too blind to understand what is happening (though I am doing my best to understand).
[22:45:34] saharsedigh: It is something for tor to be this unreliable
[22:46:13] saharsedigh: me too...me too but something is going on..
[22:46:33] saharsedigh: by the way... you told me you done both IPFS and ZeroNet
[22:46:36] saharsedigh: yes?
[22:47:00] h0p3: I've used them since they first came out, but I'm not a huge fan of either of them. 
[22:47:12] h0p3: I've an IPFS key for your directory: QmcN28TNnrnLVjYBAJdE7SAnWWqcDebKM9w2FJ8fmuscer
[22:47:30] h0p3: (but, I can't say it is easily reached...again, over Tor)
[22:48:33] saharsedigh: oh oh .....
[22:48:53] saharsedigh: the temp directory you were telling me about... in retroshare...
[22:49:30] saharsedigh: look at the access permission of that... Does it set right?
[22:49:41] saharsedigh: I can't see it...
[22:49:57] saharsedigh: check your retroshare email.. do you have any new ones?
[22:51:28] h0p3: E-mails checked. Keys added again. 
[22:53:52] h0p3: Reset permissions. Looks good.
[23:42:25] h0p3: I gotta get some sleep. 
[23:42:41] h0p3: TTYL `/salute`
[23:43:21] saharsedigh: and I got to eat.
[23:43:34] saharsedigh: nice sleep I hope ....
