title: 2020.05.13 - Prompted Introspection: Dislike

!! What are a few qualities you dislike in other people, and why?

[[2018.10.08 - Prompted Introspection: Qualities I Dislike]] is the basic answer. It's not going away. I should aim to pick specific outs.   I suppose the next [[Virtue is Knowledge]] step is to recognize that at least some [[dok]] of ignorance are malicious. We intend not to understand and act upon what actually matters. Being a good person is crazy fucking hard work. It's so difficult, most people conveniently assume you are crazy for even attempting to minmax it. Yes, this is dark-triadicism too, but that is the only thing which ought to be categorically disliked in people. 

//Dislike// is a problematic word. I use it too ambiguously. I still fail to use like/[[love]] fittingly, like a bad habit, but I've not gone the other direction in my analysis well enough though. Sure, I can be disgusted or made uncomfortable by morally arbitrary characteristics. //idontlikeurface//. Moral sensibilities are categorical concerns, not contingent accidents like the other sensibilities. We can actually be objectively wrong about them. It's not merely a swirl of limbic incompatibilities among us.
