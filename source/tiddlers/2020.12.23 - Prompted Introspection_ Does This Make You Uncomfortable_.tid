title: 2020.12.23 - Prompted Introspection: Does This Make You Uncomfortable?

!! Out of all of your past sexual experiences, what has made you the most uncomfortable?

Best questions are best questions.<<ref "o">> Saddle up, men, it's time to inform you, ( Í¡âš† ÍœÊ– Í¡âš†).

I have two kinds: those that make me physically uncomfortable and those emotionally (not that there isn't overlap). 

Physically, when we first started banging, my wife landed on shaihaludito harshly in cow-girl and I almost died that night (if you snap the twig, the tree of life withers into nothing).<<ref "l">> I've also had moments where I didn't know I was going to have sex, and I really needed to shit during (and that's no fun) or fart (that is fun).<<ref "t">> Getting sick during sex obviously isn't comfortable.<<ref "p"">> Furthermore, these days, when Chairman Meow (who is a dangerous and dumb animal, itellyawat) gets too close to my ballsack, I shrivel up in anticipation of claws.<<ref "n">>

Emotionally, when I'm balls-deep and my wife refuses to concede a point about Jesus' hypothetical Marxism or she calls out Trump's name in ecstasy, it cuts deep.<<ref "y">> Real^^tm^^ disagreements that give my wife any reason not to fuck me are uncomfortable, blue-balling, distancing, and it turns that sweet fucksesh into sadnesh. I used to be far more awkward and say whatever came to the top of my head (including Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson impressions),<<ref "w">> but now I refuse to initiate talk about anything besides economics, politics, religion, philosophy, computers, and sex in either English or grunts during SuperHappyFunTimes anymore.<<ref "x">> I've learned my lesson in 16 years.<<ref "i">> When it's time to fuck: fuck.<<ref "d">> This minimizes the odds of uncomfortableness (except the good kind*). Don't ruin it, loser. Also, when genitals don't 'asplode, that makes me sad (though I've grown less uncomfortable with it). Ultimately, that which makes me the most uncomfortable in our relationship in general is also what is most uncomfortable in sexual encounters as well: grieving, anxiety, pain, depression, anger, especially if I'm the problem or there's no way to solve it well.

<<footnotes "t" "I'm not allowed to do that. Unfortunately, it kills the mood when I explain why I have to stop. It's uncomfortable. Also, note that she's allowed to have air escape her nether regions (//talk to me, baby//), but I'm not: that's sexism.">> 

<<footnotes "p" "All sneezes and coughs are //mine//. I imagine puking has similar effects, and if I could get past the smell and sympathy, it would be so worth, right?">>
