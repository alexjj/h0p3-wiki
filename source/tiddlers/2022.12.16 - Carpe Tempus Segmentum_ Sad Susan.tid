type: 

Woke at 3:30? Meditation. Brix. Leftover kickasserole (heavily peppered ftw) + Ginger Ale. [[TTTOTW]].

Mi amor is up. Bad sleep, going to be setting her night-time notifications now, and was unhappy that she was behind this morning (she hates being late in a pathological manner). I was useful. Also, made coffee for the trio ([[1uxb0x]] has been enjoying the coffee). Picky junkies, if you mix their drugs wrong, they yell and threaten you with physical violence; I don't know how baristas put up with it. =). We still need to find a way to consistently select students through their dishonest signaling for the harder timeslots. Meetings insane today. Two sermons to write, and the [[letter]] should wait. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Coffee and the leftover cookies from mi amor's potluck (she fed a lot of students unpredictedly too).

Cleaning the basement. Laundry. Organized and sane down here. 

//The Walk// with my sympaticon, short route.

Caffeine. [[TTTOTW]] next to my sympaticon who worked through account creation and contacting folks about housing. Brix. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

Offspring came down to grind, and Ranga for crack and warmth too. We might be able to reduce heating costs down to $500 a month sticking to 50F (for 1200sqft).

Talked with [[5c0ut]] who has a meeting with his boss. Didn't sound like it was going to be good news. [[5c0ut]] has done a good job. A discussion of [[stoic]]ism, how far he has come, perspectives, his good options (just got another call for an executive chef position nearby), thinking about our trauma and fears. Not many exec chefs or directors at 30, and he's been through hell. 

//The Walk// with [[5c0ut]]. He handed his clarinet to me, and god damn that thing do hit. Coughing hard. I like how little English is spoken at the corner store. <3. It was on our way back that a school bus driver opened her door again and told us to go to the woman on the porch nearby (have to look up a steep slope to see her). She had fallen. Ran up to her. Diagnostics. Could have been a stroke, could have just been very old age. Drooling hard, woozy, with slurred speech, slow and requiring significant effort. She wasn't all there, but could answer maybe a quarter of our questions. She was drunk (I can't smell, but after walking through substances, that's the one she said "yes" to). Helped her up. Wanted to go the store, and that wasn't happening. Said we'd go for her, and she sat back down to pull cash out. Said she wanted a drink. Told her to choose one of ours, and she sipped with effort. Name and information was on her cane (not the first time, and [[5c0ut]] recognized the cops and ambulance had been at this place the past two nights). She started back up the steep stairs, 4 breaks. Paperwork (tens of thousands in bills, many medical, one for substance use recovery, maybe cancer from the look), old family photos, canned goods and snacks, lots of ashtrays. Her house was a warzone, already partially packed, stacked, and overflowing. Got her to the bed, and after a few tries she got in. Susan the Alcoholic drinks a lot ("for too long" she said). Showed me the bottle, asked her if she had drank all of that; I estimate 500ml 80 proof. That's an absolut™ fuckton for me, and that's also too much for this frail creature. She's a pro, obviously. Said she did want to go to the hospital, but then refused several times. Begged her to purge, and [[5c0ut]] brought something to puke in. She contemplated it, but would not. [[5c0ut]] was reliving a nightmare from the other side, doing everything he could to assist her. Had to introduce ourselves several times when she said she didn't know us. No family or friends she said, and no one she would allow us to call. She said she was scared, and that I was scary (I had offered to leave several times*, and I do look rough). Then she said, "I love you." And, I said the same. I do. She looked at me, with her eyepatch on her forehead, decided to make wide-eyed-contact, and wailed "I love you" again. I don't think she was speaking to me. Probably hallucinatin. Returned the claim. Talked some more, and I think she finally understood we were her neighbors down the street. Three times she said, "bless you." She signaled it was time for us to go. With help, she curled on her bed with her laptop that she couldn't open. Wouldn't take my number, but would take my card to e-mail. 

Offspring escaped [[The Den]]geon. [[j3d1h]] has completed blacklisting, and [[1uxb0x]] was unhappy with all the prefaces he read to get to //The Communist Manifesto//, wishing he had just jumped straight into it (which is funny given the meme about a capitalist preface to the book I sent him this morning). Drinks for them. Thought about the experience with my sympaticon. [[TTTOTW]].

Mi amor called. Long day, complicated by the conference leaders failing to communicate well. They got a flight for her to Texas. I don't look forward to her being gone, but I think she'll do good work there. Sounds like they could use her leadership. 

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor + Tiktoks (and some e-mails). 

[[Family Gathering]] was solid. [[1uxb0x]] made sketti and red sauce, and my sympaticon cheesy garlic bread. I had some leftover tea, too. //Mr. Robot//. I spent time trying to write mi amor's paper with GPT-3. I failed, although perhaps the output may still be useful. She's got that writer's block. Hugs'n'bugs.

//Skintime// + //Wilfred// (difficult to know how to interpret the show, to make sense of it, to figure out what could even be real, or what must be a hallucination) + //Moonrise Kingdom// with my sympaticon until she fell asleep. [[TTTOTW]]. 

[[dziggetai]] arrived an hour late and artgroup began (presumably, the group exists for him). Of course, I can take the notes of the meeting (we are in public, after all). `/salute`. Magnesium may be a worthy addition to Vitamin D. [[dziggetai]]'s dog had cancer and died when he was young, stressful, and his brother's now has cancer. EKG. Maybe anxiety. DNA tests, [[privacy]]. Parfit's question, persistent identity, and Jubilee. [[Change]] and conditions of becoming a different person. Introspection is one path, but one may have brain surgery or a head injury that could also modify them significantly enough. Habituation or drug use can do it too. The point is that one does not have to be consciously aware of or thoroughly intentional about the changes for them to occur. Moral/legal distinction failures (I could just speak the entire evening, but I've worked to avoid that by having a ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱 in the first place). 23andme, the pursuit of one's identity through genetic ancestry, the "scientific" zodiac sign buzzfeed test. Remote freelancing and career discussion.
