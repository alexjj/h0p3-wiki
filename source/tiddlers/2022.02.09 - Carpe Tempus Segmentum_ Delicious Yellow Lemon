Woke at 5:30. Meditation. She's up. Hugs'n'bugs with muh grumpkins. All the adults joined in the kitchen. [[5c0ut]] explained the moves the managers are making against the regional, `/thumbs-up`. Get that fucking psychopath out if you can. I had a leftover pulled pork rye sammich.

[[TTTOTW]]. Monching leftover pancakes + tea with my sympaticon. 

Yesterday, we walked through a bunch of new decks to understand why Affinity has a good matchup against Thresh-like Aggro-Control decks. Ghetto cubing from the leftover rares and stuff box. To make it extra educational, we're requiring 8 of each of 1-4cc's to see why it's difficult to reason about resource curves. I have no idea how to teach construction well enough. Much easier to deconstruct by smashing known lists together to see what fragments fall out of the exercise. I've got two additional handicaps: (1) I have to build singleton, (2) she can take to use any of my cards, including all of them. I started pulling out cards for her to consider, but she wants as little help as possible. `/nod`. Dope. I've gone MBCish, with necro and bargain, and other titties, etc. She should go Dedi UW(g?) Control with tutors, imho. 

[[TTTOTW]].

Offspring came down to grind. Same stuff, different day. [[5c0ut]] joined the four of us. Thanked me for encouraging him to write things down for his job. I [[hope]] he has what needs here. I think we may have 4-5 shelves devoted to food (tooling and storage too) down here now. I still need to continue work on The Unholy of Unholies. Vapelyfe.

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. She's still a bit grumpy today. Tried to help with her back. It is not popping or loosening at all. =/. My chance to listen, so I do. Fireman Time!

Lots of hanging around in the kitchen today. My daughter made a lemon cake with lemon frosting. [[ASK]] made focaccia and her classic bake. 

We're doing perfect information drafting in stages now. Taking turns modifying our decks in virtue of the others', like an evolving metagame. Since she wants to use proxies, some of the power 9 are open. Seems reasonable in black. Storm time and less control. Looks far more like a vintage deck now. Hunted down more to complete her deck out too.

[[Family Gathering]] was excellent. That bake and bread are dope, and I actually had room for cake (since I didn't go for my standard second bowl (though there was almost none left, as is standard these days :P). Watched the agoraphobe episode of //House//. I relate.

Hugs'n'bugs. //Skintime// with [[ASK]] + //ATLA//. Fell asleep way early again. I'm not able to stay up past 9 these days.
