Snap shot update of my life: moved to a new house that is almost unspeakably better than the place I was living (from the bottom of the barrel to the top, baby.)

As of Friday I have finished the first of six quarter as a master student! I have one Grant app and one scholarship app in, hoping to hear back from The former by the end of this month. My term project in “automated game design“ was a system which spits out blocks of text that are both, a, valid limericks, and B, (Usually) valid inform 7 source code.

The long road to Angelo-sensei Completion of his Indieweb-ready website deployment and development library/libraries/ecosystem/strange amusement park is coming to an end, and we should be deploying my dev site during our work session tomorrow.

Going on lots of dates :-) not one but two girls recently who are really really into poetry. And, planning this week to have an Iranian classmate over (platonic lolol) to teach her about English poetry. Have curated a selection of favorites, yeeyee.

Hans are on the up and up, I can consistently get a couple hours of typing time per day, I try to use it wisely. Still no diagnosis.

Be well, big bongus!
