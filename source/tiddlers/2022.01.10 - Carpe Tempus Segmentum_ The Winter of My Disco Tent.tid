<<<
Woke at 1:15. Slept hard. Leftovers + Water (cold enough that water pulp is almost forming) + Vapelyfe. [[Waldo_After_Dark]] suggested that [[ASmith]] get some [[Text Art]] going. `/nod`. I've thought about it for a while anyway. bzip2 can compress [[Text Art: ASmith]] from 22651 bytes to 4041. Lawd. I've seen some magic shit come out of 1kb of code though. Fireman Time! SC2.

I assume we will get omicron. May the W-Entity hospitals be dope AF.

[[TTTOTW]]. It's 4am, and both teenagers are still talking their heads off (I did get what I asked for, thankfully - I'm glad they are connecting). Third warning for my son (I know that sound is waking his mother), gg. 

Tired of trying to get magnet/.meta to work correctly in rTorrent. Tried all the tricks, and it's no go. =/. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. qBittorrent's webUI for RSS is not great, nor control over seeding (though, I prefer the client myself). Custom RSS scraping with Magnet-to-Torrent converter may be the way to go. It is uncommon for Deluge not to break for me, and I anticipate having the requisite +600 active torrents anyway.

Coffee + Vapelyfe + SC2 + [[TTTOTW]]. Need to finish [[DarkMX]] off, as [[ASmith]] inadvertently points out. Chat with [[Shah]]. It is cold AF in this basement.  

//Skintime// with [[ASK]]. She really enjoys my onesie. =D. [[TTTOTW]].

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. She decided to be extra sweet on me. //Inform the Men!// Meditation. Shower of the gods! 

[[TTTOTW]]. //The Great// with mi amor. I fell asleep. Dadnap hard. 

A wild [[lg.]] appears...

[[Family Time]] was simple.

Sous chef to [[ASK]] making potato soup. [[TTTOTW]]. Ranga wanted crack and skritches. Delivered. We ate sweet things while we chilled downstairs. I want to run out what we have in the kitchen before we go for a shop again (unless it's just a light one).

Watched //Encanto// in [[The Den]]. I got about halfway through, maybe, before Dadnap struck. I have my guesses as to why [[Shah]] enjoyed it, but it's probably not my place to explore.

Put people to bed. More soup. [[ASK]] [[shared]] sour gummy worms with me while we watched //Ping Pong//. //Raw Skintime// + //Kushiel's Dart// @ C89:10:40. Unfortunately, I think I fell asleep during part of it (I'm getting so good at this). Already an old man.

Woke at 7:15. Snuggles with [[ASK]] until I realized there was light outside. Fuck. I'm late. Better late than never: a chat with [[lg.]]. qTox crashed over night, oom, (neat), and they were writing immediately upon my login. [[TTTOTW]]. Chips. Listening to [[music]] with [[ASK]]; perhaps she has found a Canon D track I want to canonize (it's been a long, long time coming, a favorite since I first started piano).

Prepared food with my offspring. They came down to grind in [[The Den]]. They want to work together on this one. My daughter wants to minimize the number of tools they will use. `/nod`. We thought about [[lg.]]'s words quite a bit. My daughter had a lot to say.

//Skintime// with [[ASK]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

//Raw Skintime// with mi amor. Eventually, I fell asleep. 

[[Family Gathering]] was solid. We talked for quite a while before the show began. We watched the Polio episode of //House//.

I sat quietly with [[k0sh3k]].

The offspring had clogged the drain (beef fat hardened). Drain-o didn't work, so they took it apart, cleaned it out, put it back together.

//The Walk// with [[ASK]]. Talked about hyperbolic discounting and the rationality of the poor.
