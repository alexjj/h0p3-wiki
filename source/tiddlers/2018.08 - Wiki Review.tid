* I see plenty of dead links. As weird as it sounds, I'm very pleased with that.<<ref "2021.09.02-1">>
* My content has been ridiculously explosive this month. I've become more and more willing to graft content in. I'm glad I have. Centralizing this data has been useful.
* I've been generating [[antipleonasmic]] names. Lots of little tiddlers to make life smoother. I like that.
* I want to point out that I've been making serious timestamp errors lately. I'm not sure why.
* Since I spend so much time in my wiki, it's clear that a non-trivial portion of my [[Carpe Tempus Segmentum]] content is also found in this log.
* I'm meme-ing to myself quite a bit. In fact, there's a lot of gutteral reactions here. It's less analytical than usual, imho.<<ref "2021.09.02-2">>
* I love that I do this log. It really forces me to think about what I'm doing and what I've done. Not everything matters, but this log really adds up.
* [[title.Title]]s are almost [[/b/]]ish in their bravado<<ref "2021.09.02-3">>

<<footnotes "2021.09.02-1" "Yup. I guess that's how it should be explored sometimes. I feel far more compelled to prune at this point.">>

<<footnotes "2021.09.02-2" "I'm still glad of it too. I was too conservative in my emoting, and the [[Review]] process became increasingly [[/b/]]ified (as did so much of the ℍ𝕪𝕡𝕖𝕣𝔱𝔢𝔵𝔱).">>

<<footnotes "2021.09.02-3" "This has become one my favorite little things. I actively work for this these days. I can appreciate why I held back so much, and I don't think that's problematic. I was still coming to grips with what this is.">>
