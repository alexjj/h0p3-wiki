!! Audit:

* Lots of short ones, just clearing something out. I like that.<<ref "2021.09.04-1">>
* It ballooned up, as usual. It always does.<<ref "2021.09.04-2">>
* I think I tended to have more commentary. I was talking with my wife about it as well today.
* //Think About It// has grown<<ref "2021.09.04-3">>
* [[title.Title]]s showed how much I didn't enjoy it<<ref "2021.09.04-4">>
* //Stunning!// houses a lot more weirdness than usual
* I discovered that I should reach out to [[Matt McManus]] through this log. In fact, I reached out through [[FTO]] to many in my readings. I hope I continue to do that.
* I've been sitting on a lot of content as of late. I read it, then I sit on it, then I read it again and put it into the wiki. I do like that aspect of it.<<ref "2021.09.04-5">>
* I've been struggling with whether or not to include //Maymays//, and maybe even //SCWR// deserves its own.<<ref "2021.09.04-6">>
* I'm glad I still pick out things for my family.<<ref "2021.09.04-7">>
* Even if this is only proof of my hyperreading the web, it would be amazingly worth it.

<<footnotes "2021.09.04-1" "I'm looking through these now, and I don't think there are all that many short ones, especially given the length of some of the others. I feel like I've grown pickier in some respects (though more relaxed on fun and dumb shit).">>

<<footnotes "2021.09.04-2" "`/sheepish-grin`. Well, I still have thousands of tabs. One day, right? :P">>

<<footnotes "2021.09.04-3" "This has practically disappeared. I'm not saying that's a good thing.">>

<<footnotes "2021.09.04-4" "Yeah, that's a fair claim. I've had to make adjustments to keep my head above water on these. It's work, often quite unfun. I'm glad there's interesting material. It makes me wonder if one day I might drop back down from this. Is there a time where I've done my job trying to archive so heavily? I could see maybe going down to once a week, but the thing is: this is a very rare resource. Very few people seem to do it well to your standards, and you might just have to do it because not many will. Further, for ML possibilities, this is your secondary corpus, and it could make or break you. Whether or not you enjoy vocation, especially given your privilege, is perhaps not pertinent enough.">>

<<footnotes "2021.09.04-5" "It's a crucial practice! I cannot say enough good things about doing this. It's continued to reward me. I wonder if going back through the [[Link Log]] itself will eventually give rise to a similar process.">>

<<footnotes "2021.09.04-6" "Enjoy being a [[jester|WWDD]], sir. And, yes, SCWR ended up being pretty killer.">>

<<footnotes "2021.09.04-7" "You seemed to have a inkling about the value of it, but I think it's allowed you to make major transitions with your offspring with accountability. You get to point as say: I tried.">>
