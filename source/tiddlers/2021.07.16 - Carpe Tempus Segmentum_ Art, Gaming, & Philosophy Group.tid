title: 2021.07.16 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Art, Gaming, & Philosophy Group

Woke at 4:30. Bit groggy, but it hit. Meditation. [[TTTOTW]]. 

She's grumpy this morning (beyond the usual). She groggy too, but I can tell she slept. Neck feels tense, but she's not in pain. A lot of grabass. Thinking more about the underhiring. Since A is partially mailing it in (and he wouldn't deny it), checked-out before retirement, yet another boss happy to let my wife do their job for them (she collects these, srsly), we have another looking glass. The underhiring concern is pretty systematic in her local pocket (though not obviously across the board) from what we can see. Plenty of her functional peers have been university library directors elsewhere (she's young for her position, which is very surprising to me). Promotions beyond the initial requirement (a long probation period which sometimes feels like tenure) seem difficult. Unfortunately, the next step up won't be in time to take into account the magic she has worked this past year for them (it should). 

Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]].

Hugs'n'bugs. Failures. We are the confirmation of our species. Your life, not mine. Eventually, the consequences come for you, and you aren't even looking to be blameless before The Moral Law. Good luck with your non-tautological intrinsic motivation. `/suhloot`. It's a choice. That's not a heroin addiction; it's much closer to regular laziness. You can function through it, and ya gotta learn to. We'll keep trying. We can learn from our mistakes, we are plastic, and it is up to us.

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! [[TTTOTW]]. 

More hugs'n'bugs. Slashing through attitudes with arguments. Nobody has a good counterargument, and you agree the argument is sound? Yes or no? (no mumbled "yeah's" in session...is that a "yes or a no?"). Okay. The law is da law. I'm not qualified to be a father. It's that simple. They cleaned, and I prepared dinner. Also, millennial toast while watching my people get it done.

Oh, wife was right, we can't enter Canada atm. =/. To my understanding, I'd have to lie (or even partially deceive, I suppose) to get in right now. I was unwilling to do that for my vaccine, and I can't for this either. `/charlie-brown`. It's probably gonna be a bit longer, sir. One can hope that it will be lifted within the 20 weeks or so anyway, but I'm feeling more doubtful. =(.

Preparing to leave the public Dickscuck. That's a lot of virtual servers. Process takes a while. Already picked it pretty clean, but there's a doozy and a couple tools to use for archiving and cleanup.

Finished dinner up. Cleaned. Continue to annoy my offspring. Also, they were pretty sad to hear that we might have to wait. Still getting our passports asap though.

She came home. She tired, yo. Vapelyfe. //Skin Time// + //The Office//. Inform the Men! Meditation. [[TTTOTW]]. Shower of the gods! 

[[Family Gathering]] sans [[5c0ut]]@work. We watched //Arrested Development//, had to pause often (in a good way). I continue to argue about the problems of the concept of leitmotif with my daughter. I'm her retard, of course (and my wife strongly agreed to that claim today, lol). 

Art Group! I saw [[dziggetai]] earlier. ~~Surprised he's not here.~~ He is. Also, I had my volume down too low (and, I should know better). 

[[5c0ut]] came down for a hug. As did [[k0sh3k]] later. I must make sure I'm ready to hit the science museum tomorrow.

[[dziggetai]] and I rambled together (though [[Sphygmus]] and [[P]] joined in too). I'm trying to help, and I'm trying not to talk too much (which is my usual problem). I had to race through years of work on-the-fly to answer crucially broad questions (lifetimes and infeasible eons scale study) as best I could with what little I had (and that's what we all face). Picking out landmarks worth investigating, some basic chains of reasoning, and questioning assumptions. Epistemic closure. Updating priors and probabilistic inference problems (standards of justification, again). Descartes, certainty, modernity, rationalism, empiricism, Bayes, Lottery Paradox. Axioms, his assumption that if we have incorrect assumptions at all we cannot arrive at the truth. 3 minutes between agreeing with everything I said and not at all. Reductio. The Otter Measurement Modeling Assumption Gets Updated. One of the real questions he has to answer is why knowledge matters. There's the knowledge that he'd be in trouble of finding as a strict empiricist. https://ncase.me/trust/, https://cursors.io/, is he going to use Tragedy of the commons (ELI5 link to his illustration, gave the park one as well) as a central mechanic, or is it simply to teach the concept? Minimal demonstrations. Gamification of education. Seeks to educate politicians, ignorance vs. malice. Undertale. Doesn't want to be preachy, but he's kinda screwed. How do you teach someone what's important without already having picked something important out? (And what's important about it?). The problem of positivism. Wants to force us to do the "right" thing without actually being preachy or defining what consists in the "right" thing, preventing us from playing it the wrong way... There's several problems to deal with here. It's hard to see why playing a game beyond the minimal demonstration is ultimately going to influence players to be better human beings. Considering being moral in simulations too. Gaming as modeling who we are, the problem of reduction/compression, but also the problem of [[salience]] filtering out what doesn't matter enough. Qualia and learning. Trolley problem. I think I can sum up our interactions like this: "why won't you give me the answers to the questions of the meaning of life that I deny are possible in the first place?" Parasitically avoiding his own responsibilities as a student, implying it's the teacher's obligation to solve it for him. I'll remind you of the skin in the game imbalance here. I should probably just require him to write it out from now on.

Ends right at midnight.
