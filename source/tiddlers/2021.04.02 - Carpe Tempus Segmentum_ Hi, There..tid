title: 2021.04.02 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Hi, There.

//█▓▒▒░░░░ [[『Unpaused』|『Paused』]] ░░░░▒▒▓█ - Thank you for your patience with me, folks. I am forever your retard.//

Offspring can stay up late. No school for the day. Their mom is off, and I want her to feel free.

Listening to [[Music]] with [[Scout]] while he vapes. Fucking dope. Super chill. Also, small chat with [[Variety Creepy]].

Cleaning up `/mnt/m16-old-storage`. Not rsyncing with root permissions seems to cause a problem. 

[[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! x2

I recall TW's Jeremy building a very large custom TW that tried to fit data into as few tiddlers as possible. [[TDL]] is largely dead and just taking up space. It may be time to throw it in a single tiddler. Just tested [[alias]]es to 100k, and it has no obvious effect on search speed. Perhaps worthwhile.

Woke to the sound of my brother's roaring laughter for 15 straight minutes. =). Lol. You have to hear it to believe it. Sent my offspring to clean the kitchen, but bro was asleep and I wasn't sure he'd want me to go shopping without him. We got time, `/shrug`. 

Shah got an invite to IPT. Productivity and depression + anime. I hear that. ⁸Δ⁸. Vaccine-wise: tried maximum date availability, nope. Okay, well, I will get shots when I can.

Nap in lap. I'm surprised I slept, but it was glorious. I needed to be near her. 

Had offspring work on some code together while they talked with friends over a phone she's not supposed to have `/sigh`. Go on. Talk with 'em. Have fun. Worked on Mark-V, going Vivaldi for myself with a h0p3's Heap workspace. Changed her zshrc up a bit; I really need it to look different (oopsed in my own base restarting [[m16]], lol). Cleaned a bit in her room. She read poetry to me, and itdo be hittin. I bounced around folks, talked. 

It was a dormitory effect tonight, no doubt.
