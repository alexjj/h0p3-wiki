title: 2020.12.16 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Feed The Army Of The Living

* Read+Write+Walk+Talk
* Internet dropped on us. =/
** Welp, I am glad that I am a person who can make do on a LAN.
** I'm surprised that having no TV in our living room hasn't been a problem. It's a different kind of cord cut. 
*** Can always watch in one of our rooms.
* Fireman Time!
** My goal is to destroy 4 fleshytubetoys in 2021. I believe in myself. 
* Read+Write
* Bugged and consoled my wife, offspring were already awake, sent them to tasks that I predicted they wouldn't complete (though, obviously expected).
** Disappointed. That is my life as a human among humans though.
* Sleep by 8
* Woke at 11:30
** Tried getting back to sleep, but I couldn't. =/.
* [[Morning Routine]]
* Cleaning
* Second pass on living room. 
** Current theory is that it will just be a place to sit. 
** My wife will have an office in her room, but I know she prefers the couch. I'm going to make sure her spot will be on the long one because I want to be able to lay my head in her lap without getting her up (give her fewer excuses not to hold me, of course).
** Not allowed to leave boxes in books long-term (shucks), so they will decorate my wife's room.
*** Offspring divided them up and started putting them away. They need to take a deeper sweep through them (or I will), as they need more books on their shelves. 
*** The bottom of the bed is lined with books now. I am fully erect.
*** Central public space is relatively clear now. What what. 
* Some work on my offspring's arrangements.
** My daughter has an absurd amount of art supplies. She's gotta actually do something with them. She bought one shelf, and I think she should aim for another.
** They've made almost no progress. I'm going to have to do it. Explained to my daughter the cost of that, yet again.
* Son and I installed potrack. Took longer and more jimmying than I predicted.
** Lacked a tool (since we were installing it the unconventional way), but my son found a way. 
* Set up le pots. Fits like a glove. It's going to solve a lot of problems for us. 
** It's cool when everyone is excited for this one. We cook a lot. 
* Shopping at Harbor Freight
** Picked up another welding mask so my offspring can join me. Also, face shield (duh doy). 
** The cutest fucking 80amp Arc welder, and the only one in my price range. 
*** Given that it's obvious all of these have been restocked, I might be super disappointed (and, I've been spoiled). 
** Couldn't find the hooks I need.
** Our phones are recommending totally different routes. Hrm.
* The snowstorm has started. 
* Made dinner with my wife.
** I am so [[grateful]] to have a kitchen that comfortably fits multiple people. We're still perfectly awkward and fumbling over each other (but, this is also my opportunity to grab her ass). 
* [[Family Gathering]]
** Muffalettas, potato salad (I'm banned from this apparently, as my farts have destroyed the house...everyone says there is something wrong with me [nuh uh]), green beans (that giant can didn't last long), and a beer. 
** [[MTG]]: not even my idea at this point. It's the thing they want to do. Dope. Plenty to learn.
*** Wife URThresh vs Son's MUC: she takes it down, squeaks by as delver does. Gas takes it to the red zone, then it's top burn > top permission. I'm thinking we may have found the deck for her. Thresh/Fish is a playstyle that is timeless, it must obtain in all real^^tm^^ eternal metagames from what I can see. 
*** Daughter's Affinity vs Shitfinity +3, +2, +1: wasn't so color screwed, tezz alphastrike first, double disciple + shrapnel in last two games (the nuts). 
* Sleep by 9, falling asleep at the table. I even turned down another game with my son.
* Woke at 11:45
* Ranga is back!
** The snow is several inches deep now, and I guess he decided to nope the fuck out of nature. Good call, kitnkat.
** Females are exceptionally relieved. I'm relieved insofar as they are, for the most part (I've seen the cat do this many times). My wife is back. 
*** Funny part is that he won't go near her. Completely uni-directional love for this psychopathic cat. She knows [[love]]. 
**** I think there's something to be said for having openly served the dark-triads among us. That experience, in contrast to [[The Others]] I seek, is quite a teacher, at the very least.

Putting the house together has slowed down. I hate to say it, but everyone's room is close to the usual state, lol. We're in almost normal territory at this point. I don't want us to lose our mojo and inertia though. Setting it up now will pay dividends long-term. It's not like moving to an apartment where we don't think we'll be there for long so that we're like: why even bother trying to set it up? Let us take advantage of the wealth of having our own place immediately; it's a snowball.
