title: 2021.09.28 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Brief

[[ASK]] is still in the ER. I write while waiting on news. It was abruptly over. Still thinking about it. [[TTTOTW]]. Fireman Time! Sleep by 3?

Woke at 6:40, right before she leaves (in, fact she's a tad later than usual). Says she needs help with her nest upstairs, but it sounds like hell to her. Maybe Saturday. Bread + [[TTTOTW]]. [[ASK]]ing. She's not out of the pit, but at least hanging in there.

Thunder. 

Sleep by 11?

Woke at 5:30? Long Fireman Time! It was 6:30 before I even saw my [[monster]]. 

Lightning Struck. Marginal Thunder. [[ASK]]ing, and continued the conversation train with [[Shah]]. She came down to do her Greek, just woke up from her own nap (good). Annoying problems with work, as people aren't wearing their masks (and her signs are getting downright sarcastic :P) and legal is involved now (an official complaint was launched). Not much she can do, but she can continue to generate the fitting paper trails (which, she is extremely adept at doing). Like her, I'm opposed to having security guards/police officers (since the Y-Entity has their own force) wandering the library (beyond disturbing). Her boss' boss understands, it seems. SZ is beginning bi-monthly meetings for promotion (I really like the way that woman operates, and whenever we arrive at the same conclusion or behavior as she does, I feel better about our perspective).

Big XOXOs and beard friction with [[5c0ut]]. He's hanging in there.

//The Walk// with my offspring, very late: 7:15 before we got out the door. My son talked about a game called //Darkest Dungeon// which he described as akin to a roguelike with "cock and ball torture," so it must be quite good. //Dust City// seems like an alright book. I kept asking questions, as is my job. My daughter talked math, and she seemed bored of it. We had a blast though. It was dark, so that was different for them. My daughter talked about OCD concepts, including Pure-O. Her argument did not stand up to scrutiny, so we have some doubt to wrestle with. 

Offspring took way too long to solve their problem in the kitchen. [[ASK]]ing. She's having a terrible day. //Skintime//. Finished the runway show on //Project Runway//, and I lost all remaining faith in the judges (it's, like, negative now). This was clearly decided upon marketability, forced by production perhaps, but definitely because someone makes money off that drama (which, even S1 taught us).

[[Family Gathering]] was late and pleasant. We had pizza and salad, I had some water and dark chocolate too. We watched The Death Row episode of //House//. My offspring aren't missing a beat anymore. It's nice. //Skintime//. 

Thunder.
