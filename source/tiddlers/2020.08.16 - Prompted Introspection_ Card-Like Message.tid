title: 2020.08.16 - Prompted Introspection: Card-Like Message

!! When was the last time you sent or received a card-like message from someone?

I am increasingly appreciative of receiving messages from people. My mind has changed to some [[dok]] from [[2017.07.06 - Prompted Introspection Log]].<<ref "d">> The [[S2NR]] has grown higher in my experience. Receiving an e-mail out of the blue from someone can be quite a gift. I'm lucky to find relationships beginning with some card-like qualities. I clearly prefer digital messages to physical ones. 

The last one was very recent: [[2020.08.16 - kyr0ss: Greetings]]. I am still digesting.
