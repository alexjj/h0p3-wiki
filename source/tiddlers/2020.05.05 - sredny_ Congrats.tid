h0p3,

Just a quick note to say I've spent the entirety of my day off reading your wiki. I don't usually message strangers out of the blue but I was compelled to congratulate you.

Love your brand of humour. Your writings to your wife were beautiful and the fart smeltings had me creasing up. Very creative, very well organised. Love it. The blend of philosophy, musings, and linguistics are right up my alley. Very impressed. The whole thing looks fantastic -- what an effort, brother.

I find myself wondering what you know now that you wish you had known when you started off?

I've been poking and prodding at different knowledge base software/methods for over a year. I've been unwilling to commit to any given platform but stumbling across the Tiddlywiki Telegram and finding your wiki amongst the chat has convinced me to go in that direction.

No pressure to respond. If nothing else, I hope this serves to give you a little boost today, or tomorrow, or whenever you read it. A little recognition from a stranger goes a long way sometimes. 

Keep on trucking. All the love from rainy Melbourne.
