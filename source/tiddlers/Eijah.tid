Happy Thanksgiving, folks. I hope you have a solid meal with people you enjoy being with.

Eijah
Happy Thanksgiving!!!

There's a lot of information on titan.wiki
Demonsaw is being replaced by a new app in a few months. 10x better =D

h0p3
Will Ryft aim to be distributed? Can it be fully routed over Tor, including filesharing?

Hello demonz

h0p3
`/salute`

k0r
how are you guys ?

@H0p3 Yes

Presumably, every user will have their own onion key, something like [[DarkMX]] or [[MuWire]] (RIP*).
What's the DHT lookin' like? I'm trying to understand how best these should be built (not an easy problem).
Will both TCP and UDP be available? Ideally, how will you limit the reliance upon federation? Self-hosting is crucial, I agree. [[NAT Traversal]] is a key problem, imho, with maybe 95% success rate at the state-of-the-art.

Eijah
I taught a class on NAT traversal at DEF CON this year
https://www.ryft.app/defcon30/
You can dload the files if you want ;)

h0p3
Yes, I saw this.
Part of why I'm curious about how Ryft would prefer to do it.

Eijah
Ryft is multi-platform, which adds some extra challenges. e.g. NAT traversal must be done differently on telco networks.
def makes it more fun ;)

h0p3
Mobile is particularly difficult. For resources sake, do you intend to make it easy to call-home and let a user's other boxes do the heavy lifting?

Eijah
Ryft doesn't use DHT because that is a mobile-killer...

h0p3
Well, I appreciate your talking with me about it, Eijah. I wish you [[luck]] on this project. May it at the very least replace [[Discord]] for a wide variety of users.

Eijah
ty!
