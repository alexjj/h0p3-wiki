title: 2022.01.29 - Variety Creepy: Huzzah, homie

Dear Variety Creepy,

I'm hoping you're feeling better, sir. There's nothing I can do over here, and I know you're young and in a good position to overcome your illness, but I've still been worried about you.

> Just a general disgust. A have a lot of history and just thinking about them makes me go ugh

Disgust is not an easy feeling to deal with. It's highly predictive in many types of relationships. Prescription may be another matter. I appreciate what it's like to feel disgust with a great number of people. I hunt for the [[gem]]s like you, sir. 

So, what makes someone worth not avoiding? What have been the most successful relationships you've had in your life?

> Maybe he would.

That's your call to make, if you ever want us to [[connect]]. `/salute`. I'm happy just to speak with you.

> Not that painful. I will be joining him in 4 years. I hope we could meet when I'm in the US. Yes, I will be communicating with him regularly.
> Mostly we would do a family Zoom call or a FaceTime everyday or something like that

Everyday is pretty [[awe]]some. Finding people who will consistently foster [[intimacy]] with us each day is a non-trivial task (success might even be somewhat uncommon). I can see why it's not as painful in that case. Huzzah, homie.

As I get older, more paranoid, and probably even more retardeder, I've grown more hedged-conservative about how I spend myself in real-time interactions (though I do crave real-time interaction*). I've long preferred voice to video in almost all contexts (including with [[my wife]]). I [[like]] to walk while I talk; it's nearly compulsive for me.

> The chip-fab monopolies may not be owned by US citizens, but their monopoly is just manufacturing those chips and supplying them. Their only scope in that field is to take the orders from companies that require chips, manufacture them and deliver. They aren't doing much R&D either.

Hrm. Perhaps you know far more about this than I do. I'm no expert, but I am trying to understand. I grew up in some [[dok]] of poverty, so I'm still catching up to modeling the world as well as many others (I may never actually catch up, I realize).

Those monopolies<<ref "a">> are pretty deep in the supply chain, and that's to their advantage. Chip shortages have been a big deal these past couple years, especially after adjustments to just-in-time manufacturing have been made. To my understanding, most companies are no longer as willing to invest in their own R&D and construction for fabrication ($100 billion is a huge risk), and, at least for the top end, TSMC<<ref "t">> (and ASML<<ref "as">> indirectly) has been becoming the only game in town. Intel seems to be faltering. I'm on the outside though, so I can't say I've nearly enough information here.

I agree there's far more to electrical engineering than these chips though, and perhaps more importantly, there's a much wider range of engineering projects to consider than [[computing]] chips. I'm just saying that there have been developments in others parts of the world (outside the US) that have been goldmines for engineers. I could imagine that continuing to occur. 

As to shocking changes in the value and power of the US or USD, I see plenty of possibilities. For example, it is not clear to me that the USD will remain the reserve currency. Major shifts and shocks have already been occurring, and I predict the cycle will continue (I have no idea how it will end though). Here's some gibberish that might be worth thinking about, `/shrug`: [[2021.08.12 - /b/]]. To my eyes, the remaining parts of US military dominance (battletested in neverending immoral wars and funded into oblivion), a semi-safe and self-sufficient geography (though there are some rare commodities that can't be found here so easily), cultural export hegemony,<<ref "w">> exploitative global brain drain, elite transnational influence of the US political economy, and a lack of safer places to find growth may be some of the significant reasons your doubts are correct. It's a bad thing for Humanity, imho. 

I'm still rooting for Bangalore, sir.

> My thoughts on China are that it has already beaten the US in many aspects. I'm just saying this based on the stuff they keep releasing. But China also cannot be trusted, so I don't know whether they are using lying as a scare tactic or actually have surpassed the US technologically. Also, China is known for its secrecy. Who knows what the reality is and what technology they have. Whatever they have, they sure as hell don't want to share it with anyone. Especially Indians and Americans.

You're probably right. What aspects (perhaps you mean to talk about more than technology here)? What releases have caught your eye the most? I [[trust]] neither the US nor China here. I'm more impressed (as [[appraisal respect|2014.02.17 - Bare Metal Recognition and Appraisal Respect]] for their effectiveness and prowess, temporarily setting aside the matter of justification) by the social structures and data ownership (broadly conceived*) their elite have shaped with technology (an impressive centralization of [[power]]). I could imagine they have some profound data for modeling citizens. All this said, as a mere student of technology, to my poor understanding, I can't say I rely upon Chinese software (and services) much, except insofar as they've bought stakes in US tech firms. I wonder how much that is really changing for most people.

> Multiple times. Mostly when I was a toddler, but not so much these days.

Why'd that [[change]] for ya?

> The last time I travelled in a night train was in 10th grade.

Now that you are an adult, will you be traveling all over India? I assume even years of travel would barely scratch the surface.

> India has a nice railway system.

I'm jelly, homie. I suggest full stack corruption (including the malicious ignorance of Boomers) is one of the reasons we don't have anything that comes even close to what you have there. 

> It's the world's biggest employer and many people use it. 

I'm surprised by this claim. I suggest that, among any of the standard employers in the world, the US DoD directly has the highest employee population and volume of capital flowing through it, and, indirectly, I think the real numbers are even higher than is officially stated or calculated. It may be [[India's largest employer|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_employers]], though perhaps the Indian Armed Forces may employ about the same number of people. I don't know. I rely upon others to inform me. You are in position to know better than I am.

> These days, time is short and aeroplanes have replaced the trains. 

For the average person in India?

> People want to save time. But I have to admit, trains are still fascinating and I prefer them over aeroplanes.

As an autist, I've always been fascinated by trains. When I was 6, we moved to New Haven, KY (there are many city [[name]]s that show up multiple times in different states for me, oddly enough), and our neighbor was a conductor. A train station (not for passengers) was right in front of our house. He gave us the tour. It was pretty fucking cool. 

Do you find yourself more interested in trains than most people?

> I think you've got it wrong. It's the other way around. I don't like cooking for myself or I downloaded the app to get to know the days when I shouldn't eat meat when I eating at a restaurant or in the college cafeteria. My mum is the one who doesn't want me to eat out because it's unhealthy in the long run and according to her, eating too much meat isn't good either.

I wasn't clear enough. I'm sorry. I could imagine you might not enjoy preparing food, but I was and still am interested in at least knowing what you enjoy preparing the most (or at least knowing what you do prepare, when you do). But, I can see that while I may [[share]] your mother's conclusion, it may be for different reasons.

Meat is so delicious. Prices have been going up here in the US, considerably. Have you felt something similar in India? 

Hopefully, you've been getting some food in you while you've been sick. May you feel 100% asap, sir.

[[Love]],

[[h0p3]]

Insofar as it is even technically possible, I'd adore seeing soup-to-nuts open and verifiable fabrication. I do not predict that will occur. It is possible that the US MIC will require increasing domestic fabrication (seems like it), but I do not know.">>

However, it appears the company has been incentivized to build facilities in the US and EU, perhaps only insofar as the DoD is funding it. It is not clear to me that China is radically opposed to this either. A case could be made that they may be willing trade some control of high-end technology (the less dependent the US is on Taiwan, the less likely it is to defend it) for the strategic value of annexation instead. Again, I don't know. I'm pretty fucking worried though.">>
