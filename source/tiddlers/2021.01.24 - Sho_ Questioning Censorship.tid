Hey, sorry for tainting you with evil google emails! lol

Things are getting proper scary and confusing. I think I'm going to have to make myself a general rule to just not ever type out what I really think/feel about some things on any device.
I have a vague understanding of 'fingerprinting' and what you mean by that, and the things they do have access to record/correlate and whatnot. 
Are you saying though that using a VPN for torrents won't protect me?
Fuck, I'm afraid to ask, but what are your thoughts on that generally? I mean, there must be so many millions of people downloading (I use uto r rent/pir ataba y ) what are the odds? But jesus, I dinnae need any fucking legal hassle.

I just moved our savings to Ed's account because now and then my bank messages me about 'it looks like you have tax duties elsewhere' because of the bullshit U Sa laws !!! but I just keep ignoring it, because I can't outright lie, but I'm not admitting nothing, either.

Fuck, I hate the world so much, d ude.
Our government(s) particularly. Though I'm pretty fucking pissed off with/scared of China, too, and Russia, a bit. 

That could become a whole other tangent, sorry.

What's TOR you speak of?

Also, I use firefox sometimes (for some reason I can't log into my legit facebook on chrome, so i do it on firefox, which is nice cause it has that 'facebook fence' thingy to stop FB tracking your other site stuff. Anyway, is firefox legit trustworthy, then? And what's this about using protonmail and a firefox profile? This is something that interests me.

Even though I can't see how I could get rid of the google stuff I've got now. I guess they've got what they've got, and I have to do my best not to provide t hem with more.

I tell you though, it's scary. I mean, I'm not involved in anything, and I never will be, because I'm selfish and lazy and DONE with the world. However, my mum got put in 'facebook jail' for a week because she referred to some congresswoman as a 'bitch'. No violent speak, jus tname-calling. WTF, we cannae even call dumbfucks by their names, now!? I mean, that's mental.

I'm not all good with this blocking Trump and QAnon accounts - for one, they're only doing it because he's no longer president, which itself is sus as fuck, and wrong. But for two ... so, right now they're blocking QAnon for misinformation etc, which is fine because that is utter bullshit.
But what happens when they decide to block, eh, the rest of us?

Anyway, gotta go. Thanks for your help.
