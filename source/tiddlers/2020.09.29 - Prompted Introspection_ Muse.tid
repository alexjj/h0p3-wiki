!! What was the last thing you read, heard, or saw that inspired you?

I don't think it's easy to define "inspired" to my liking, and, at least for me, it's often a combination of different pieces of information sources and experiences that give rise to what might normally be considered inspiration.<<ref "i">> I don't think inspiration is always a pleasant thing either, and I'm not sure what kind of reaction or kind of object must be generated for it to be called inspired. Is it merely a really strong feeling? 

Everything is moving too fast. It's too surreal. I'm drowning. Hypernormalization of hyperobjects of hyperreality is pwning my monkeybrain. Just give me tits, please. Yeah. It's my wife's ass, tits, face, voice, and joining. That's where I want to be. That is my daily source of inspiration for just being a blob there, letting go, safe, happy, filtering everything else out, a pile of emotion with limited cognition. What inspires me not to think? That's gotta be the ticket. Surely, all holes will be filled, all layers pierced, all desires satisfied, all existential crises solved, all stresses unwound, all pursuits of meaning enmeaningified, all perspectives and wills represented, all ises been, etc. What the fuck am I doing here fucking?
