As an abolitionist or eliminativist, I often feel gender identity tends to serve as a nebulous socially constructed trap for faux virtue signaling among competing identitarian tribes in a fashion market of arbitrarily regulated words used as a relatively low-violence measurement of who has power and the appearance of respect among professional victims. Of course, there are moral limits to both compelled speech and blindly validating people's stories and personalities (as though these are protected classes we can't question or criticize). We don't escape categorizing and naming ourselves, but it's crucial to see that self-identification is meaningful primarily because it's an input for improving our models of objective facts, even concerning our own subjectivities. It remains far from obvious to me why we should think we have an inalienable moral right to be publicly recognized by what we declare ourselves to be merely because we declared it, including gender identity. Nor do I see a reason to think one would have absolutely privileged access to one's gender identity either, as though it is necessarily better identified from a first-person perspective. From what I can see: gender identity is a fully particularized personality or disposition (wherein every person is their own gender), and if it's not that, it's a fiction, even if the consequences of this labeling spectacle are quite real. We can be inclusive, tolerant, sensitive to dysphoria, open to the imaginative, and prima facie work to refer to people by their preferred labels without accepting that gender identity is objectively real (or even coherent) beyond ideological headcanon. Without resorting to gender identity realism (which isn't a denial of differences between and [[dok]] of sexes) or assenting to conditioning within social markets tout court: analyzing sexual dysphoria, assigned or aspirational gender roles, and internalized or endorsed gender norms sufficiently achieves the essential conceptual and explanatory heavy lifting we require as egalitarians. Don't blindly affirm gender identities; subvert them. Why seek to make a better kind of femininity, masculinity, or otherinity? Why attempt to discover yet more gender roles? Instead, work to do away with these roles (which isn't to say each of us doesn't have a role to play in the world), and de-internalize, mitigate, and compensate for the disadvantages generated by unjustified gender norms (which isn't to say there aren't universal norms we ought live by), particularly those arising from exploitative markets and irrational social pressures. Pursue a post-gender-identity world that recognizes the damage this fiction has caused, and focus on the highest priority class warfare problems at the heart of material in[[justice]]. What matters about who we are is that we're persons; we're moral agents, and we owe each [[other]] a great deal.

In addition to inertia, I think one of the barriers to global "they/them" adoption is pronoun agreement errors, where gendered language allows us to speak and evaluate lazily.

The high road is almost never the high ground, except where it matters most: your moral integrity.
