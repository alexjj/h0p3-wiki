!! Respond to the following:

<<<
A sentimentalist is simply one who wants to have the luxury of an emotion without paying for it.

What the fuck do you predict from hedonism and the aesthetic mode? Radical incoherence and a lack of justification in their character! XD. It should result in [[personality disintegration|Positive Disintegration]], but why choose that when it's so delicious to ignore reality? Hint: if you're that far gone, and if you don't feel like it, you'll be unlikely to be fittingly motivated to fix that problem.

As a quasi old school Kantian (revived as a [[Straussian]]), I've tried to make my peace with moral sentimentalism^^tm^^.<<ref "f">> I'll agree that moral facts make essential reference to our sentiments (in a necessary but insufficient sense) and that our sentiments are a significant source of our moral knowledge (much weaker than is standardly intended). That's probably not what you think you mean here, but in the prioritization of our mental states, it is what you mean. 

Obviously, I'm a huge fan of attempts to dunk on sentimentalism. Let me hand you some ammo, my friend. I think what you're brilliantly picking out for us is the failure to recognize the primacy of cognitive Rationality in justifying our feelings, choices, and experiences. The sentimentalist is underhandedly anti-realist at the end of the day, and, as such, they trend toward egoism and psychopathy. Truth is expensive, and a sentimentalist seeks subjectivist shortcuts. Saint Kant (and Saint Jesus before him) continues to be the lamp unto our feet.
