title: 2020.11.24 - Prompted Introspection: Fucking Autist

!! If You could have one talent that you do not naturally have, what would it be?

[[2019.09.04 - Prompted Introspection: Talent]] is fairly similar, and that question is answered in an airtightish manner. I could give many outlandish answers to this question, Lady Melisandre. I want to give a supernatural answer beyond the sanity of metaphysics (however deflationary we ought be). Why wouldn't I go for some maximalist squeeze of this profoundly rare resource? I could give far more selfish answers too.<<ref "t">> I want to give a silly answer this time, but even there I have the habit of just turning it up to 11, into something absurd. 

Without a loss in moral merit (obviously, preferably with only gains<<ref "g">>)), I wish I were more likable, affable, easier to connect with, agreeable to others.<<ref "y">> I work to [[ltf]] in socializing, but I wish it were effortless. That would be so freeing. Instead of spending my cognition on empathy-translation, I'd be able to wander more. I would be a much happier human too, and I think most people who encountered me would as well.

<<footnotes "t" "Though I have sadly learned in the past year that a non-stop orgasm can become tiresome and unwanted. It's even less clear to me what maximum pleasure would be like given how the constancy of pleasure turns into a pain. I should know better. I've encountered arguments like it before. I don't know what to think about it.">>
