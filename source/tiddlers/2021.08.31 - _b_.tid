I wonder how many people are actually on a watchlist for buying Ivermectin (no chips in it, I swear) and tweeting about Jewish space lasers burning down forests (apparently, they are at it again, those bastards).

I walk to try and "walk off" my entire life. It's complicated to walk off the walking off.

Insofar as they can be peeled apart, my estimate is that fitting information expression tends to require about 100x more energy than fitting consumption (that might be wildly lowballing it).

Energy consumption and heat dissipation seem like reasonable proxies for [[power]] and privilege (non-trivial factors, at least). It's not easy to guess how to measure it.

Reflecting the light of [[the other]] back to them is not [[love]] simpliciter, but it can be a deep expression of it. The capacity to recognize and reflect the nature of [[the other]] is a form of empathy, which is a key function to [[love]]. Note, however, that the outward manifestation is not the intention, and that high-functioning sociopaths can be exceptionally skilled at empathizing, including reflecting yourself to you in a mirror. [[Love]] is ultimately more sacrificial and selfless; it is a willingness to extinguish our own lights for others [[irwartfrr]], and sometimes [[love]] is about guiding [[the other]] who is blind (proofs requiring more than mirrors sometimes too). Otherwise, you might be talking about transactional narcissism and borderline personalities (I don't take that to be your intention). You're missing a crucial piece.

Horray for wrestling with the cluster of anti-[materialism, mechanism, nominalism, skepticism, relativism], and it's obvious Saint Aristotle was a Platonist in essence, he just worked from the other direction (I'd argue bottom-up).
