title: 2020.11.18 - Prompted Introspection: An Expert

!! What expert do you wish could come teach you what they know?

That is a tricky one. What is worth learning most in my context assuming I had access to such a ridiculous resource?<<ref "i">> The vacuously correct answer is the result of a function that requires information I don't have. It would probably be the person who could help me figure out the next set of answers to that question in an extremely practical way. Beyond that, I am, of course, forced to [[fff]]ingly guess.

I have plenty of uni-directional picks I'd like to see bi-directional. [[Saint Hegel]] would be quite an honor. I would enjoy meeting Saint Jesus, Saint Diogenes, Saint Socrates, [[Saint Plato]], Saint Aristotle, Saint Kant, Saint Spinoza, and Saint Kierkegaard. What would Saint Marx say if I could convince him of what the world would look like? Saint Gödel wrestled with the continuum, [[SO]]L, the ontological argument, and more I cannot see. John muhfuckin von Neumann seems like an insane pick too. This list of brilliance is stupidly long, and it doesn't even begin to pick out the nameless geniuses that very well may have been able to teach me far more about what matters most.

There are a lot topics that I think it would be very useful to become even 95% above average at (which is presumably what an expert can help me do to a high degree of my potential<<ref "a">>). Picking a living person seems pretty difficult (surely there's at least 100k people that would rock my world inside and out, especially if they really got to know me). I don't know who I need to speak with the most. Obviously, I'm not convinced that the experts I want to learn from would spend their time with me. I also hope to speak with those who want to speak with me. Assuming these conditions are met though, I want to speak with a profound generalist (and I can't reasonably pick this out). I assume a polymath polyglot would be more than prepared to fix my retardations. Of course, they would only be able to teach me a sliver of what they really understand because I'm not as intelligent or as knowledgeable as they are; it would be a waste of their prowess (I think their time can be spent far better on someone or something else).

Okay. I have my picks, and I know I'm not worthy: Terence Tao<<ref "t">> or Grigori Perelman.<<ref "p">> I have so many missing puzzle pieces and puzzles too.<<ref "l">> It would take the rest of their lives to try to tutor me, and I have no idea what fruit it would bear. I imagine, like anyone who had to spend that much time with me, they would be profoundly disappointed, ¯\(°_o)/¯, lol. 

Thank you, Lady Melisandre. This is one of my favorite questions from you.

<<footnotes "a" "And, I'm definitely going to pick someone who's an expert in a bunch of places since I don't have enough information to specialize an answer. They say Saint Aristotle was the last to know everything, and, of course, we can try to pick out those who came close later in history. That might roughly be the idea of it here though.">>

<<footnotes "i" "I consider it a joke that I could possibly learn what a genius among geniuses level expert knows in mathematics, physics, CS, economics, or philosophy (and I use this term very broadly for those who study the Humanities in ways I simply don't understand too). But, god damn!, I would fucking try in a heartbeat.">>

<<footnotes "t" "Alas, I do not pass the incomplete [[22-point restriction|https://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/tags.html]] notice on [[Contact]]ing him. He is, of course, a very busy man. I can see his understanding of religion would perhaps make me a poor candidate for [[friendship]] even.">>

<<footnotes "p" "His activities and his persona have interest to me, and I suppose he'd have to set aside his reclusive frustrations with my disturbing him. Of course, I would be honored to help him pick mushrooms.">>

<<footnotes "l" "I can name off logicians (surely, I would be insufferable ;P), but I think my lack of mathematics in general is an even greater weakness that would be amazing to fill out.">>
