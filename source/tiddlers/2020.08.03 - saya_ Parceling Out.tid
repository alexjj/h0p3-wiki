title: 2020.08.03 - saya: Parceling Out

"""
[9:04 PM] saya: i'm poking around on your wiki some more and i think i'd like to make my own
[9:05 PM] h0p3: Awesome. I suggest starting single-file mode for a while.
[9:06 PM] h0p3: Keep good backups, and I suggest using git from the beginning.
[9:15 PM] saya: my only site is on tilde.club rn so this will be an Adventure
[9:15 PM] saya: i also have a domain off nearlyfreespeech.net but idk what to do with that either
[9:16 PM] saya: that's what bugging my mentors is for ig /s
[9:17 PM] h0p3: My friend https://sphygm.us/ uses nearlyfreespeech. I tried them out. I appreciate what they do.
[9:18 PM] h0p3: Most people will use their VPS to host the nodejs version of TW.
[9:19 PM] saya: i... maybe i'm just gonna run this off my mentor's raspberry pi IDK
[9:19 PM] saya: nearlyfreespeech confuses me
[9:19 PM] h0p3: Seems insane to not own the process on your own hardware.
[9:19 PM] saya: as in the fact that i need to set up everything else
[9:19 PM] saya: i'm gonna be in a dorm room in two weeks
[9:20 PM] saya: heck i was homeless er
[9:20 PM] saya: half this summer
[9:20 PM] saya: owning the process is uhh
[9:20 PM] saya: aksjldfjlhkajdsf
[9:20 PM] saya: on the list of priorities
[9:20 PM] saya: i do have a raspberry pi 3 tho
[9:20 PM] h0p3: If you ever need a place to stay, we live in New Haven, CT.
[9:21 PM] h0p3: I suggest single-file mode on your primary device for quite some time.
[9:21 PM] h0p3: Timimi or File-backups from PMario.
[9:22 PM] h0p3: Don't worry about the rest of the infrastructure just yet.
[9:22 PM] h0p3: Just get your feet wet and your hands dirty actually making a wiki.
[9:24 PM] h0p3: I also suggest using a browser exclusively for the wiki from the beginning. Set aside a version of Chromium, FF, or FFDE just for the wiki. Make it so that you can tailor the browser extensions to your needs. It will give you multiple layers of customization (in addition to what can be built inside TW itself).
saya pinned a message to this channel. 
See all the pins.

[9:35 PM] saya: ig this is my project for the rest of the week
[9:35 PM] saya: in addition to making masks
[9:37 PM] h0p3: I am 4 years into mine, and I still consider myself an intermediate user at best. I've seen a lot of people berzerk use it for a week and then just drop it. You can set yourself up well in a week to keep learning it for years.
[9:40 PM] saya: oki
[9:41 PM] saya: it seems like a nice counterpoint to the notebooks i already use
[9:54 PM] saya: random aside but i feel like i'd get along with your kids from what i see on the wiki
do you have any sage Dad Advice to parcel out to a young college freshman-to-be
[10:01 PM] saya: (tell kickscondor their security cert expired and browsers are making angry noises about it)
[10:23 PM] h0p3: I am not a skilled interpreter of my friend, Sir [[kickscondor]], but I am open to the claim that this appearance is on purpose. He is currently reworking the face of his site, and this arguably fits the theme.
[10:23 PM] h0p3: Yeah, I think you'd get along well with my offspring. https://j3d1h.philosopher.life/ and https://1uxb0x.philosopher.life/.
[10:57 PM] h0p3: While I aim to [[Be A Good Dad]], I think I have a long way to go. I'll tell you what I tell them, though I doubt I have advice for you that you don't already know. For context, I graduated college at 19, and if I had it to do over again (and some other things were different in my life), I'd have started at 18 or 19 instead (from what I can tell, you are much further ahead in a lot of ways than I was at your age). I criticize education systems a lot, but I'm basically a religious zealot about learning. Learning about and applying what is [[salient]] is serious bidness to me; I think it is what I exist to do as a human. I think that's true of all of us. So, do the best you can with what you have. Shoot for what matters most. Seek to be transformed by your education; it's gonna hurt like a bitch sometimes. See it as your vocation for the coming years. Whether you get to perform this ritual at a certified institution or simply learn on your own in a public library: this is so much more than getting a piece of paper to get a job, pushing that hedonic treadmill button, a mere novel experience, or some virtue-signaling status acquisition. Hold nothing back, throw everything you have it, every sacred object you own, every ounce of energy. On average, you'll get out what you put in.
[10:57 PM] h0p3: Some of your major intelligences peak at around 21, your frontal lobes aren't really finished developing until you are 25 (though I suggest psychedelic use here for one more massive push in openness), and this will be the last opportunity to sculpt your identities while they are so price-efficiently plastic. This is a narrow window in life, and you should squeeze it for everything you can. Find people who are worth having a lifelong relationship with, sleep 8 hours a night (no, for real), eat right (I'm such a fucking hypocrite), exercise, practice harm-reduction in substance use (and it is better to avoid it if you can), spend 1-2 hours outside of class for every hour you spend inside class. Getting the A is missing the fucking point (often anyone can do that), and some of the most important classes are the ones that you get a C in. Visit your professors during office hours, prepare for discussions with them (at least gloss over their work), and take your first year or two to explore and take epistemic risks (you may change your mind about where you are going several times). Slit throats of bad ideas in the classroom, fulfill your obligations to every person in the dialectic, and remember that the authors and professors you encounter are human (you should have disagreements with them).
[11:29 PM] saya: i've been talking to a couple profs here and there and they've encouraged me not to rush through undergrad, which is interesting
[11:29 PM] saya: i have enough credits to graduate in three if i wanted to, but i really don't
[11:30 PM] saya: part of what i want to do is take the time to make myself more mentally healthy because hs burnout? wheeeew boy
[11:30 PM] saya: i wanna be happy learning and connecting with my professors and hopefully maybe make some friends my age (lol)
[11:32 PM] saya: something that has been on my mind is that i'm going straight into computer science and it seems like a lot of my curriculum will be stem-based
[11:32 PM] saya: i've taken cs for 4 years so i know it's something i genuinely enjoy
[11:33 PM] saya: i just hope i won't miss out on the humanities
[11:34 PM] saya: because between cs and gis there's not all that much room for other curricular things
[11:35 PM] saya: part of it is also that i've been told that i need a really strong technical base as a woman of color because otherwise no one will ever take me seriously
[11:35 PM] saya: which is depressing but True
[11:35 PM] h0p3: I must admit that most of my CS students didn't have nearly enough humanities under their belts (but, I say the same of my humanities student with respect to CS).
[11:36 PM] h0p3: I am not qualified to say.
[11:36 PM] h0p3: I can also point you to tools that I think will last you a lifetime.
[11:36 PM] saya: that would be greatly appreciated
