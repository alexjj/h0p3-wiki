title: 2021.11.12 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: No Silly Romance, Only Eternal Thrusting

//Skintime// with [[ASK]] and //Another Period//. Sleep by 1:30?

Woke at 9? [[TTTOTW]]. Hugs'n'bugs. Vapelyfe + Chili + Chips + Water. [[TTTOTW]]. Brain hurts; feeling kinda exhausted from reading.

Offspring came down to grind. My daughter continued the conversation about some true RNG dice with off-the-shelf electronics (and other similar projects). [[TTTOTW]]. Quesadillas. [[TTTOTW]].

//The Walk// with my offspring was tough but good. School was same (surprise!). Projected what my daughter's life might be like ~2 years from now. All the cards were handed to me. Took it in stride, and we moved on. `/thumbs-up`. My son took us down a history of nuclear research (up to the a-bomb) and the politics surrounding it. It is his best subject this semester (and, it makes me happy that geography is something he enjoys so much, going hand-in-hand with it). Vapelyfe. Son continues to [[share]] candy with us. Took the long route, and I don't remember shit about the rest of the conversation. We had a good time though. Erryone was in a good mood by the end. 

[[ASK]] continues to work on her boxes (both cardboard and silicon). Talked computers. She's got a hard-nosed "I'm going to do it myself" search-the-interwebs approach that I admire quite a bit, obviously. Worked on my daughter's Wacom tablet (worked well for Linux out of the box but not for Windows [and passthrough seemed to be problematic for some of its functionality]); she's not been able to get it to work at all, but that's because she's not tried it without the HMDI connection (and, in a sense, why would you? defeats the purpose). Windows recognizes the hardware, and you can adjust settings for its input behavior well. Unfortunately, the screen infiniflashing (a bootloop of some kind) cannot be fixed so easily (and she's done everything she ought, imho). 

Mi amor took me aside. //Raw Skintime//. Told me about her day. 98, ofc. Overprepared. After having a sociopath for a director kicked, the power vacuum has been filled by Karen-cancer. The tearing apart continues. I really don't like how slow things move through the system either; taking years to fill vacancies is bonkers to me. Groups are punished for this, let the cancer seep out before restarting, perhaps. As long as they are not swallowed by the centralizing agency.* //Inform the Men!// Hit so hard, I became drowzy (not sleepy). Meditation of some kind (HPPD). Shower of the gods!

My daughter made cheetos cheesy pasta for us (a pleasant surprise, as it's scrounge night),<<ref "t">> and I got a bunch of fruit as well. Ate in [[The Den]] with mi amor watching some of //The Office//. Dadnap in her lap. Woke at 9. 

Artgroup. Chips and tzatziki sauce<<ref "t2">> while watching //Animal Crossing//. [[dziggetai]] is lookin' into getting a new box here soon enough. A tour of [[Sphygmus]]' apartment and even glimpses of her. Huge fan of seeing what books and collections people keep. It's hilarious what she calls messy, as predicted. A Voynich book and the complete collection of E.E. Cummings.<<ref "o">> Childhoods preserved in here too. It is of no surprise that she studied the details of many graphical books, and her own work requires the same payment, imho. A flip through a sketchbook with a wide variety of artifacts.<<ref "i">> Walks down memory lane. The LFO sausage fattener was phat.
