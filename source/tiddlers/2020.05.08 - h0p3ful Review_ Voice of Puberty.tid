** Fuck yeah, 10 hours sounds excellent. Sleep in tomorrow if you want.
** This is one of the better TDL's I can recall in recent memory. 
** Where are your mother's requirements? 
*** This is unacceptable. Do not force me to escalate. The ball is in your court, my pre-moves are made. I am your state machine.
*[[2020.05.07 – Wiki Review: Caps unlocked]]
** There's more of your personality, preference, and perspective coming out in here. Vamp it up. Keep going. Let's hear your voice continue to develop. 
*** I still feel like I'm in P^^ub^^erty with my voice on my wiki. It takes time.

** Ah, I like how you are attempting to define "action." That is an expensive problem.
** I see no reason to think that at least some instances of happiness I've experienced did not come from my own actions. Should we just throw some counterexamples at this to pinpoint the errors and re-write his claim as it ought to be articulated (even if he would not initially agree or didn't intend our version)?

** Look, my [[CTS]] have been awful for a long time (who knows if I will ever escape it). I hope you will consider filling this out more. Keep pushing. Stream-of-consciousness and studying your day, get it out.

** I am concerned about the possibility that the US-Chinese war will continue to escalate. 
*** Internal Chinese political documents may support this, and plenty of US conservative thinktankers see it too.
**** It is a war of capitalist-supporting state vs capitalist-supporting state, vying for hegemony in the material dialectic, but more importantly, they are mere pieces used by capitalists themselves. I have no idea what will happen.
*** Let us work hard now, and we'll burn that bridge when we get to it. 
** Of course, I think quant, CS, and philosophy are where you should go, academically. How are you going to make money? Seems like being a programmer, a virtuous computer-toucher, is a reasonable dream. You got some game, kid. We have to turn it up.  
*[[The Lightning Thief: 9, draft 1]]
** Sick. This is a great first draft, sir. 
*** I just want to remind you that it won't always be this simple or gorgeous. You're gonna have to scrap drafts too. It's an ugly, painful process sometimes. It sure is sweet when you nail it in the first few tries though. Just remember not to be too discouraged when it doesn't work out for ya. Some things takes years (maybe even lifetimes) to accomplish.
