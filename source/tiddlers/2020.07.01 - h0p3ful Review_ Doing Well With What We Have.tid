** You will admit that I've proven you've been lying several times, right?
*** k. As you know, I will have to continue to adjust my predictions (and, I know we both can change).
*[[The Lightning Thief: 19 + 20, notes]]
** I'm grateful to see your gut instincts and tacit beliefs+desires coming out in your notetaking.
*[[2020.06.30 – Wiki Review: Empty title.]]
** You can and will grow.
** Was I just as angry as you predicted?
*** Perhaps you should consider working toward modifying your prediction mechanism. 
**** This is part of why we keep notes, btw. It allows us to recognize patterns in our reasoning and give some shape to the way we think (both in planning long-term and in what we will commit to in the moment). It's a chance to be empiricists with a solid lab.
** Your [[TDL]]s have been different, and I am glad to see you thinking about how they should be shaped. As you know, I don't know how to do this well enough either.
** You aren't ready for the presentation. =(. Alright. We wait.
** I am glad that you are able to get angry with me, to display it, and to reason about it with me too. I hope we can use our anger together wisely. Wrestling is incredibly expensive, as you know. I appreciate how honorable you are in your anger.
*[[2020.06.30 – TDL: New clock?]]
** What about a watch? Yeah, with a stopwatch on it too, eh? Could just have a stopwatch around your neck. 
*** Oh, you mean an alarm clock? Yeah, you should fix that. Better sooner rather than later, yeah?
*[[2020.06.30 – Prompted Introspection: Reeee]]
** Can you think of any exceptions? That is a place you could have extended your reasoning.
** You should consider looking up other people's thoughts too. You may find new preference this way sometimes.
*[[2020.06.30 – Carpe Diem: More shit.]]
** Lol. Well, are you?
** What shit?
*** We will search for it.
*[[2020.06.30 – Antipleonasm Analysis: Value of time]]
** All excellent points, sir. This is a draft. You should continue to draft, extend, and polish this line of reasoning. I know you already see a lot of the places it goes. 
** Thank you for such a thorough response.
*[[Yearly Cross-section]]
** [[Character three: Rash]] is dope. Tag it. These are worth collecting.
** I am grateful that we are able to buy clothes for us. You remind me that we've done well with what we've had.
