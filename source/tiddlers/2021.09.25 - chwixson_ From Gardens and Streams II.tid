Hey Christin,

My wife is an academic librarian who also uses TW. I was wondering how you used TW in your life and work. Here's mine (https://philosopher.life) and here's hers (https://bookwyrm.quest). Our offspring have their own, but that might not be as interesting for you (if any of this is actually interesting at at all to you, lol :P). 

Sincerely,
