[11:06 AM] robotic_scarab:
we had ants.
this may not be news to you, or is a silly thing to point out, but borax + sugar water + cotton balls around counter edges = very dead ants. it's worked every single time wherever I've lived :)
[4:23 PM] h0p3: Thank you! Not silly at all. We got these traps, but they didn't seem to work. What are the cotton balls for?
[5:00 PM] h0p3: Also, I ran across something that reminded me of your art (though it is scarier): https://i.redd.it/46yp1njg09i51.jpg
[5:07 PM] robotic_scarab: ah, you mix the water, sugar, and borax together, then soak the cotton balls in it
[5:07 PM] robotic_scarab: I believe it's just to make putting the mixture out easier
[5:07 PM] h0p3: Ah, balls are delivery vehicles
[5:07 PM] robotic_scarab: yup!
[5:08 PM] robotic_scarab: you'll probably want to google for the proportions of borax to sugar to water, I don't know them off the top of my head
[5:08 PM] robotic_scarab: ahhhh that link says it was deleted?
[5:08 PM] h0p3: Will do.
[5:09 PM] h0p3:

[5:09 PM] h0p3: Hrm. Must be a cached copy for me.
[5:09 PM] robotic_scarab: ahhh whoa
[5:10 PM] robotic_scarab: that's a cool take on the typical "black and white eye drawn in charcoal" trope :craughing:

[1:00 PM] robotic_scarab: tiny mis-spelling, should be "so" to get the footnote at the bottom to link up ;)

[1:00 PM] robotic_scarab: oh, in tapeda's draft letter
[1:27 PM] h0p3: Gracias!
[6:11 PM] h0p3: I don't say it often enough to the people at the heart of my life: I love you. Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ. I am grateful to be with you in the world, especially when I find it dark outside. Beyond cool, you bring warmth and light to my life. I admire how you are kind. You help me remember why I want to be a good (whatever the word means) person, and you make it easy to want to [[FTO]], [[WINTCIS]]. I appreciate that we know the other is listening (and, for a paranoid like me, you hand me proof after proof; I know I'm so expensive to speak with sometimes), and I am grateful that I get to trust you.

[1:06 PM] robotic_scarab: thank you, I love you too <3
It's hard for me to believe that it's been 2 years since I met you through kicks -- so much has happened and changed over that time and I think it's clear in both of our wikis!
I keep coming back to my east coast trip plans in my head and though I'll be very awkward bunny I greatly look forward to the thought of spending time with you and your family, participating in Family Time on Sunday if you'll let me, talking wiki shop and walking together. I don't know why I feel this so strongly recently, and I have no idea when it will actually come to pass, but I look forward to it. :)
[1:11 PM] robotic_scarab: and, speaking of proofs:
`Nope. There was literally a bug inside my shirt crawling around for an hour. Into the outside with you.`
AHHHHHHHH NOPE NOPE NOPE KILL IT WITH FIRE
[1:11 PM] robotic_scarab: that's like my worst nightmare, ugh, bugs inside clothing or inside bedsheets :distress:

[3:20 AM] h0p3: The world is up in the air, and I never know where the pieces fall. You always have a place with us. Feel free to visit whenever you can, even on a whim. You'll have to feel whatever you need to feel with us. I think you'll be able to feel comfortable being awkward with us: we swim in awkwardness here. We were dreaming about having you here for [[Family Time]] during our walk tonight. We are looking forward to it too! :slight_smile:
[3:22 AM] h0p3: Also, once I realized it really was a bug, I scrambled out of my shirt and threw it away in fear, lol. Took a breath, then found the little dude. Bugs are fascinating (and even delicious sometimes), but I don't like touching them. I would definitely do it for Fear Factor money, but k0sh3k claims she would not bath in a vat of cockroaches for all the money in the world (I would do that for $500, lol).
