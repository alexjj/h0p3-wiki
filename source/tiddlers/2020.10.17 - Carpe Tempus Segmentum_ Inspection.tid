title: 2020.10.17 - Carpe Tempus Segmentum: Inspection

Apparently, I'm keeping the goatee. I look meaner with it. I'm not Lucifer, but I am beardfishing biker satan. Perfect. Does it enable me to acquire moar pussy? This is the real question.

* Read
* AFireman Time!
* Read+LoL
* Sleep by 2:15
* Woke at 6:30
** Nervous. Couldn't sleep more. I'm [[grateful]] for what I got though. Hit dat spot.
* Trolled my wife.
* The Inspection
** David was the salesman's name, and I was the dumb student (as I generally am). He even said he always wanted to be a teacher. I appreciate that.
*** I heard at least one lie (but, he did tell the truth that mattered about the valve in his self-correction). He was competent (we talked about the habits he had formed, his eye was fast), and I saw his empathy. I believe him about the inspection.
*** His argument about the market was garbage. He doesn't know much of anything.
** Nothing actionable. House is in reasonable shape. It has been rubberstamped. 
*** I am worried about the older heating mechanisms in the home. Guessed projection is 10k in the next decade, though sometimes these last much longer (and whoever owned the house was gentle with it).
** Found old things from a previous owner. The attic is dope. 
** If it goes through, the offspring and I will have to walk through the house carefully. We need to plan.
*** There's lots of little things to clean up. It was flipped in a hurry. 
** Offspring started speaking with the realtor. My son goes straight for controversial discussions. He's so edgy. I'm glad though.  
* //The Walk//
** Went the extra long route. It's been forever.
** We are excited about the meetup tomorrow.
** Hands and rabbitholes.
** Pokebowl + Reeses
* Inform the Men
** Though I did not get to hide the jew.
* Meditation
* Fell asleep. Sweet, merciful sleep. It's been a day.
* Woke at 10?
* //Reality Bites//
* //Skintime//
* Stopped by https://www.reddit.com/r/girlsfarting/. This monster I started has grown. Mods dropped off the map, it's been revamped, and it's a classy joint now. Love what they've done with the place.
** These people are salt of the earth. I never intended it to be NSFW, but I'm super glad it is now. it's tremendous.
