"""
[10:50 PM] saya: i need to send my legal documents back to my parents so they can apply for citizenship and i am on the merge of a moderate meltdown
[10:51 PM] saya: they say they need my birth certificate and my ssn and they want my us passport for... safekeeping
[10:51 PM] saya: but i'm [[REDACTED]] months away from 18 and
[10:51 PM] saya: i am scared and angry
[10:52 PM] saya: and i don't know if they need my us passport for the citizenship thing
[10:53 PM] saya: can you please help me with a few questions
[10:53 PM] h0p3: We are way outside of what I understand. I will do what I can.
[10:53 PM] saya: okay thank you
[10:54 PM] h0p3: Is it fair to say that you are concerned they will not give your political-identification back to you?
[10:54 PM] saya: yes
[10:54 PM] h0p3: I think you need a lawyer.
[10:54 PM] saya: my mom is like well we need it for safekeeping
[10:55 PM] saya: and if we need to leave the country fast
[10:55 PM] saya: like i don't think it's malicious but she is not thinking if she thinks i am comfortable leaving my docs with people i ran away from for a month and a half
[10:56 PM] h0p3: I am opposed to you not having your ID in hand.
[10:56 PM] saya: she was like "you should have asked permission and not just taken them from the safe" and i'm here like
[10:56 PM] saya: i'm in [[REDACTED]]
[10:56 PM] h0p3: I know.
[10:56 PM] saya: ;-;
[10:56 PM] saya: so i have a couple questions that are pressing rn
[10:58 PM] saya: there is a notary on campus, and i want to get a certified copy of my birth certificate from the [[REDACTED]] registrar (with the embossed seal and stuff)
i looked up the requirements but they're a little confusing, but theoretically i should have everything i need right now on me to get that with photocopies, probably notarized? i'm not sure
[10:58 PM] saya: if it helps i was born in [[REDACTED]]
[10:58 PM] saya: because counties have their own laws maybe
[11:00 PM] saya: my second question is: i'm not 18 yet, and my passport is expired, and i don't know where the nearest us embassy is or the process of renewing it in person (because it got issued before i was [[REDACTED]] i can't just do mail)
could you send me a link or two with relevant info because this stuff is a maze
[11:00 PM] saya: third: will a photocopy or scan of my ssn card do as proof for employment authorization
[11:01 PM] saya: i'm gonna not send this stuff back through usps (rip) but i will have to cajole one of my suitemates into giving me a car ride
[11:02 PM] h0p3: What is your time table? What happens if you don't send it back?
[11:04 PM] h0p3: I cannot in good conscience give you advice here. I think you need to speak with a lawyer who specializes in this (and, if it matters, you might consider taking steps for emancipation...I simply don't know enough).
[11:04 PM] h0p3: I will give you links that stand out, but it's not enough.
[11:05 PM] h0p3: https://forum.legaljunkies.com/forum/immigration-law
[11:06 PM] h0p3: I have never been able to use a notorized copy of some of my documents. I would be surprised if you don't hit a snag here.
[11:06 PM] h0p3: https://www.nationalnotary.org/notary-bulletin/blog/2016/09/certified-copies-public-records-unusual-notary-requests
[11:07 PM] h0p3: Part of the equation that I do not understand well enough is: how much can they interfere with your ability to stay in school?
[11:08 PM] h0p3: Look, right now, I have no reason to trust your parents (even if they are good people, I can't see that from here). I'm blind here. I have to assume the worst. I feel like you should play defense.
[11:09 PM] saya: my time table is basically by this weekend
[11:09 PM] saya: the link about the certified copy is why i want to get the registrar copy from [[REDACTED]] (the only ones with official jurisdiction over said certified copies)
[11:10 PM] h0p3: That makes sense.
[11:11 PM] h0p3: I don't know if you can even get your own documentation at your age.
[11:11 PM] saya: the good thing is they can't interfere with my school enrollment or funding
[11:11 PM] h0p3: Would they try?
[11:12 PM] h0p3: Are there other issues at stake if you do not comply?
[11:12 PM] saya: there is a possibility if i piss them off enough but fafsa privacy should stop them from being able to pull me out
[11:12 PM] saya: like i'm here on full scholarship they can't touch that
[11:13 PM] saya: if they don't give me extra money for food i can still make it through this semester and the next
[11:13 PM] saya: the big thing is probably health insurance
[11:15 PM] saya: the thing is when i ran away they got really angry and said a lot of shit about cutting me off so
[11:15 PM] saya: i don't trust them at all anymore
[11:20 PM] h0p3: I've always had to bring my SSN card for employment. You do have your own card, right?
[11:21 PM] saya: yes
[11:21 PM] saya: but she wants me to send it back
[11:21 PM] saya: she was like "oh they'll take a copy" and i was like
[11:21 PM] saya: are you fucking sure
[11:21 PM] h0p3: Oh, then send her a copy.
[11:21 PM] saya: no she means that
[11:21 PM] h0p3: oh, for your employment
[11:21 PM] h0p3: no fuck that
[11:21 PM] saya: like employers will
[11:22 PM] h0p3: Redflags to me. I say you keep your paperwork and try to find a lawyer to advise you, someone who specializes in minors and immigration concerns.
[11:22 PM] saya: like she doesn't know what she's talking about!!!
[11:22 PM] saya: and she's all like "oh safekeeping and what if we need to leave the country really fast"
[11:23 PM] saya: i'm here like i want these docs if i have to vote in [[REDACTED]]
[11:23 PM] saya: but also yes citizenship requirements
[11:23 PM] saya: fuck
[11:23 PM] saya: it explicitly says children's birth certificates but what else? who knoooows
[11:25 PM] saya: okay we have an attorney service on campus for student immigration and general legal advice
[11:25 PM] saya: i just don't even know what questions to ask
[11:26 PM] saya: i've never been this bewilderingly confused
[11:26 PM] saya: it also has links to the american immigration lawyers association and proyecto inmigrante
[11:29 PM] saya: yup my mom has no idea what she’s talking about
[11:30 PM] saya:

[11:35 PM] saya: lol “what do you need legal advice for”
[11:36 PM] h0p3: Before you continue with them, I ask you to listen for a second.
[11:36 PM] h0p3: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/toxic-relationships/201911/the-price-and-payoff-gray-rock-strategy
[11:38 PM] h0p3: It's not good that they still have 3 months of legal parental power over you. I still wouldn't give up my documents though (like, I would hide them so they couldn't be taken from me if push came to shove).
[11:39 PM] h0p3: I am not convinced it is worth engaging them about the matter until you've received advice from a qualified and more objective individual who can hear your story and reason correctly about what you ought to do.
[11:42 PM] h0p3: It's possible that a lawyer will say this isn't a big deal at all, that recovering your documents after they've been lost or stolen will be doable. I cannot guess what your counselor will counsel.
[11:43 PM] h0p3: Passport seems extra crucial to me. You'll probably have to wait until you are 18 for that...I'd feel much better with a new passport under my belt. Don't cave to the pressure. They can wait a few months for you to sort it out.
[11:45 PM] h0p3: My daughter is 14, and she has her own documents. It's that important to me that she has them safely stored for her own use. This doesn't feel right to me at all.
[11:48 PM] saya: my dad said i can keep the us passport but they still need the birth certificate and ssn card
[11:48 PM] saya: for the [[REDACTED]] interview
[11:50 PM] h0p3: I woke up my wife to ask her. She says you should keep your documents too and speak with someone who knows.
[11:50 PM] saya: and they found a birth certificate copy
[11:50 PM] saya: great
[11:50 PM] h0p3: Good!
[11:50 PM] saya: they still want the ssn which uh
[11:50 PM] h0p3: I have two copies myself (a very, very old one and a fancier new one, so that works out for me).
[11:50 PM] saya: lawyer time
[11:50 PM] h0p3: But, you should not say more...it's already tipped your hand that you would consider going to war like this.
[11:51 PM] h0p3: I don't know the implications of what will occur. I would not hand my enemies an ounce of information.
[11:51 PM] saya: i didn’t tell them i was going to lawyers bc i didn’t trust them
[11:52 PM] saya: i told them i wanted legal advice bc i’m scared of ice and being in [[REDACTED]] and i want to be able to vote here if i have to
[11:52 PM] h0p3: I adore those covers (because they are true too, sadly). I still ask you to say as little as you can until you've spoken with an expert.
[11:52 PM] saya: and by lawyer time i meant time to double check if i need to send it and can i get a copy now
[11:53 PM] saya: yup
[11:54 PM] saya: at least now i can figure out how to get shiny extra copies of everything and make a plan for going to the us embassy asap
[11:54 PM] h0p3: `/high-5`
[11:55 PM] h0p3: Also, I didn't have to go to embassy for mine. I just mailed in for it (expedited took about 2 months), but that was a very long time ago.
[11:56 PM] saya: i have to go in person bc my last one was issued before i turned [[REDACTED]]
[11:57 PM] h0p3: I acquired my first and only passport at ~21. I don't know enough about the current process.
[11:57 PM] h0p3: Sucks if you have to go in person. =/

[12:00 AM] saya: yep
[12:01 AM] saya: tomorrow i will go to the copy center and get a scan of my ssn
[12:01 AM] saya: and then i will order a fireproof safe or something
[12:01 AM] saya: my partner is really here with only a health insurance card
[12:02 AM] saya: white guy privilege? it really be like that sometimes
[12:02 AM] h0p3: I agree. Lol.
[12:06 AM] saya: gotta love spanish lookin last names too
[12:06 AM] saya: ice go o-o
[12:10 AM] saya: currently checking ssn physical card requirements
[12:10 AM] saya: for employment
[7:13 PM] saya: my current hobby w my partner: making various dishes in an instant pot (+ streaming it to the boiz)
[7:13 PM] saya: tonight we're gonna make cheesecake!
[7:15 PM] h0p3: Dope. I need get another instant pot. Ours is about dead. Just making rice right now in ours.
[7:16 PM] saya: my parents actually sent me with an an instant pot and a dedicated rice cooker because asian things
[7:16 PM] h0p3: :slight_smile:
[7:16 PM] saya: do you have any instant pot recipes
[7:17 PM] saya: it has been a sorta scavenger hunt trying to find the right ingredients from the nearby 7/11, on-campus restaurants, my own store of ingredients
[7:17 PM] saya: we got three tubs of cream cheese from the bagel shop and it was hella expensive but it's gonna be good cream cheese
[7:18 PM] h0p3: I don't have any instant pot recipes. That is something I should collect though.
[7:19 PM] saya: you have an instant pot and no recipes
you're the wiki guy holy shit
[7:19 PM] h0p3: Lol
[7:19 PM] saya: >:(((((
[7:19 PM] h0p3: I don't really keep any food recipes.
[7:20 PM] saya: tbh we don't either bc i cook by taste and texture
[7:20 PM] saya: but at least i can vaguely circumlocute what food i do make
[7:20 PM] h0p3: I am lucky if it tastes acceptable, lol. As long as my food doesn't offend, then I have succeeded.
[7:21 PM] saya: ._.
[7:21 PM] saya: i hope your children cook better than you do
[7:22 PM] saya: humanity should continually strive for the peak of culinary excellence imho
[7:23 PM] h0p3: Lol. Yeah, they cook so much better than I did at their age.
[7:23 PM] h0p3: My brother [[AIR]] is a chef, though he's left the industry recently.
[7:23 PM] saya: respect to chefs
[7:24 PM] saya: that's a hard, thankless job
[9:12 PM] saya: i got a frozen egg meme out of the cheesecake making
[9:12 PM] saya: apparently our minifridge is so cold that it froze these cracked eggs
[9:12 PM] saya: but the shell froze apart from the membrane
[9:12 PM] saya: science!

11:57 AM] saya:

[7:58 PM] h0p3: Looks amazing! :slight_smile:
[10:40 PM] saya: currently organizing my freshman class because the uni is shutting down food options for walkup but they won't let us use meal exchange for mobile ordering
[10:40 PM] saya: so we're all just..... gonna crowd the dining hall?
