Q: How many Hegelians does it take to screw in a light bulb?

A: Two, of course. One stands at one end of the room and argues that it isn’t dark; the other stands across from him and says that true light is impossible. This dialectic creates a synthesis when the bulb gets screwed in.

Spirit, on the contrary, may be defined as that which has its center in itself. It has not a unity outside itself, but has already found it; it exists in and with itself. Matter has its essence out of itself; Spirit is self-contained existence. Now this is Freedom, exactly. For if I am dependent, my being is referred to something else which I am not; I cannot exist independently of something external. I am free, on the contrary, when my existence depends upon myself. This self-contained existence of Spirit is none other than self-consciousness consciousness of one's own being. Two things must be distinguished in consciousness; first, the fact that I know; secondly, what I know. In self-consciousness these are merged in one; for Spirit knows itself. It involves an appreciation of its own nature, as also an energy enabling it to realise itself; to make itself actually that which it is potentially.

This is a light that breaks forth on spiritual substance, and shows absolute content and absolute form to be identical; - substance is in itself identical with knowledge. Self-consciousness thus, in the third place, recognizes its positive relation as its negative, and its negative as its positive, - or, in other words, recognizes these opposite activities as the same i.e. it recognizes pure Thought or Being as self-identity, and this again as separation. This is intellectual perception; but it is requisite in order that it should be in truth intellectual, that it should not be that merely immediate perception of the eternal and the divine which we hear of, but should be absolute knowledge. This intuitive perception which does not recognize itself is taken as starting-point as if it were absolutely presupposed; it has in itself intuitive perception only as immediate knowledge, and what it perceives it does not really know, - for, taken at its best, it consists of beautiful thoughts, but not knowledge.

Self-identity, however, is pure abstraction; but this is thinking. . . . It subsists through this simple oneness with itself. But it is thereby essentially a thought. Comprehended in this is the fact that Being is Thought; and this is the source of that insight which usually eludes the usual superficial talk about the identity of Thought and Being.

In immediate self-consciousness the simple ego is absolute object, which, however, is for us or in itself absolute mediation, and has as its essential moment substantial and solid independence. The dissolution of that simple unity is the result of the first experience; through this there is posited a pure self-consciousness, and a consciousness which is not purely for itself, but for another, i.e. as an existent consciousness, consciousness in the form and shape of thinghood. Both moments are essential, since, in the first instance, they are unlike and opposed, and their reflexion into unity has not yet come to light, they stand as two opposed forms or modes of consciousness. The one is independent whose essential nature is to be for itself, the other is dependent whose essence is life or existence for another. The former is the Master, or Lord, the latter is the Bondsman.

What Kant regarded as a unique (Copernican) turn to transcendental reflection becomes in Hegel a general mechanism for turning consciousness back upon itself. This mechanism has been switched on and off time and time again in the development of spirit. As the subject becomes conscious of itself, it destroys one form of consciousness after another. This process epitomizes the subjective experience that what initially appears to the subject as a being in itself can become content only in the forms imparted to it by the subject. The transcendental philosopher’s experience is thus, according to Hegel, reenacted naively whenever an in-itself becomes a for-the-subject. What Hegel calls “Dialectical” is the reconstruction of this recurrent experience and of its assimilation by the subject, which gives rise to ever more complex structures. … Hegel, it should be noted, exposes himself to a criticism. … Reconstructing successive forms of consciousness is one thing. Proving the necessity of their succession is quite another.

Hegel agreed with Kant that realism and objectivism were dead ends. Kant had transcended them by making the subject prior, but from Hegel’s perspective he had been too wishy-washy in doing so. Kant made the subject responsible only for the phenomenal world of experience, leaving noumenal reality forever closed off to us. This was intolerable to Hegel—after all, the whole point of philosophy is to achieve union with reality, to escape the merely sensuous and finite and to come to know and be one with the supersensuous and infinite.

However, Hegel had no intention of trying to solve the epistemological puzzles about perception, concept-formation, and induction that had set Kant’s agenda, in order to show us how we might acquire knowledge of the noumenal. Instead, taking a cue from Johann Fichte, Hegel’s strategy was to assert boldly an identity of subject and object, thus closing the gap metaphysically.

The relationship of the Phenomenology to the rest of the system is as an entrance exam. It is a test for those who have presuppositions about the world that they are unable to suspend, in order to begin with Hegel’s Logic and follow the development of thought that is unfolded there. The Phenomenology charts alternative perspectives on how we know the world and demonstrates the inadequacy of all of them. For this reason, Hegel calls this discussion ‘the pathway of doubt, or more precisely as the way of despair’.

* bimodal hylomorphic conceptual realism
* Hegel regards the subjective articulation of the conceptual content of commitments by deontic normative relations of material incompatibility and consequence, and the objective articulation of the conceptual content of facts and properties by alethic modal relations of material incompatibility and consequence, as two sides of one coin. The world exhibits relations of necessity and possibility: If a ball is red, it can’t be (it necessarily isn’t) blue, but it can be round. Somehow its redness repels its being blue with this deep metaphysical force. These forces are the alethic modal relations. These two species of weird relations are two sides of the same coin. The world manifests itself in itself in terms of alethic modal relations: if the ball is red, it can’t be blue, and in us in terms of deontic ones: if I believe it’s red, I shouldn’t believe it’s blue. The logic of the world reflects and is reflected by the logic of human responsibilities, and these responsibilities are crucially things which one ought or ought not do.


* The Real ⇔ The Rational
** Nothing is real except the idea.
** Any idea is a generalization, and generalization is a property of thinking. To generalize something means to think it.
** To him who looks upon the world rationally, the world in its turn presents a rational aspect. The relation is mutual.

* Motion/Change
** Motion produces true contradictions. Contradictions can be true, and progress consists in transcending them. Motion took motion to be inconsistent. It is not to be here at one point in time, and not here at another, but to be both here and not here in one and the same point in time. A master of paraconsistent logic and [[The Dialetheia]] long before we formally recognized it.
** The movement toward the absolute, the becoming-concrete of ideas, is really similar to the movement from pure dunamis (potency) to energeia (being at work). Highly Aristotelian.
** Change, according to Hegel, was the rule of life. Every idea irrepressibly bred its opposite and the two merged into a synthesis which in turn produced its own contradiction.

* Freedom
** Freedom is the insight into necessity.

* If everything we do is mediated by thoughts or representations, we can never get beyond them to the reality they’re meant to represent. Different thinkers had different views on this: Berkeley accepted the problem and boldly did without the external world, suggesting that there were only thoughts. Kant sort of merged mind and world: what we call cats are the co-production of stuff out there and our mind... instead of there being mind on the one hand and world on the other hand, he thinks that there is mind on one hand and mind on the other.

* The universe and history as a whole are idealistically rational. All possible worlds are sublated by it.

* Mind is the ultimate reality.
** Instead of self-thinking thing thinking about itself, I'd say self-computing thing computing itself (and everything else).
** There is a difference between the representation of "The World" in our minds and The World itself. The correlation issue must be resolved into the infinite.
*** I just don't see why this leads to self-realization of the unified Absolute object for which only it is its own subject. Why should I agree that "it perceives" itself. Look, the hard problem of consciousness, dualism redeux can't be solved. It's a conceptual problem of doubt. OOO is there as well. I can't help you with this. I do not see why my doubt is less warranted than your belief.

* Geist is self-creative energy imbued with a drive to become fully conscious of itself as spirit.

* The truth of things is thought, that is, their true being is thought. 

* Like Saint Heidegger the Nazi, [[Saint Plato]] the Aristocrat, and philosophy that appeared to be self-serving speculative chatter of a self-ordained class of independently wealthy men, we must forgive Saint Hegel's Prussian hard-on and elitism, and much more. Yet, his framework for politics gives rise to Saint Marx for good reason.

* Counter-intuitive, hard to be skeptical though. [[Straussian]] interpretation is necessary. Even when he's wrong, you can find a way to make a version of him that is right.

* There are certain pairs of opposed concepts — like infinity and finitude, positive and negative, identity and difference, and of course left and right — where the one simply cannot be understood except somehow through the other.
** First paired opposite: being and nothingness
*** "The truth is neither being nor nothing, but rather that being has passed over into nothing and nothing into being"
** Building on this process, we arrive at all possible ideas or rational thought, metaphysics, transcendental...exhausted the dialectically structured categorial realm

* Extending the doubt of Descartes Cogito from, "I think, therefore I am" to "There is thinking, therefore there is something," an opening to the denial of self to some [[dok]].

* Negatives lead eventually to the positive recognition that one has exhausted negativity: negativity is the path to the truth

* Truth is found neither in the thesis nor the antithesis, but in an emergent synthesis which reconciles the two.

* The true is the whole.
** An individual piece only has meaning when it is seen as part of the whole.
** The truth of the particular is the universal.

* What Opposites Have In Common Is That They Have Nothing In Common

* In thinking through things in the way that asks what they mean and how they are meaningful you end up with contradictions when you start hitting at the real meaning. These contradictions are dialectics, they are unavoidable and generated from within whatever you're thinking through. Reason does not stop at these contradictions and strives to find something that underlies them and unifies them, but does not destroy them, merely eases the friction of the contradiction by changing the topic so to say.
** Being and Nothing are intrinsically tied, their meaning is that they are not each other, and they seem fundamentally the same in their content, this is a contradiction because one is basically saying Being=Nothing. The way to move forward is to get out of the categories of static pure Being and Nothing, and move into the dynamic category of Becoming where static Being and Nothing are moments of Becoming.
** There is no "theory" of dialectics. It's just internal critique of a subject matter, thinking through the definition of a concept and going beyond the definition. You're asking "Is this concept/thing really absolute in meaning/being or is it dependent on something else?" Hegel says everything is dependent on something else, and fundamental categories of metaphysics lead to contradictions. Even the Absolute requires the relative within it to make sense, but it's precisely because the Absolute includes even its opposite that it is really Absolute.


* The Fichtean Fiction
** Thesis-Antithesis-Synthesis
** In Hegel, there is a dialectic of oppositions, influenced strongly by Heraclitus. The oppositions exist in a state of tension. The aufhebung (sublation) of the oppositions is a unity and negation which preserves the opposites in their tension.
** An example is the master/slave dialectic. In short, a master comes along and enslaves someone. The master exerts his will and forces the slave to do his bidding. The slave subjects his will to the will of the master. In doing so, the slave learns what it is to be a self, precisely by coming to know the will of the other. The aufhebung is ultimately the enlightenment era ideal of the autonomous individual, who knows of others and is not enslaved by them, nor enslaves, but respects their autonomy. It is a preservation of the slave's respect for and knowledge of the other, and also the master's self-controlled willing; but it is a negation of the slave's submission and the master's unbound ability to will over others.
*** There is no 'synthesis' here.
** Sublation moves fairly teleologically toward the Absolute. The whole process is one of consciousness or spirit (geist), a history in an unusual sense, hegelian phenomenology.

* Ethics
** Ideas, for Hegel, must be embodied in social conditions to be considered "concrete" in any sense. Thus, in Hegel's practical philosophy, the "truth" of our ethical actions doesn't occur in terms of the ideal conformity of our intention with an abstract or ideal law (like the categorical imperative), but in "the deed itself," a material reality that's "exposed to the light of day." Ethical principles, for Hegel, must take on an objective, material character, otherwise they remain mere abstractions.
** Likewise, Hegel will say, the point of an "ought" is for it to become an "is." I can't think of anything more in line with Marx's eleventh thesis on Feuerbach.


* German Idealism, phenomenology as (at least in part) a product of consciousness
** The true heir of Saint Kant's epistemology
** Hegel thinks consciousness must be a process of becoming that has a distinct history.
** Reality is one thing: [[The Absolute]]. Its characteristic is rationality, that is, it contains no contradictions. Truth or knowledge is truth or knowledge of [[The Absolute]], a partial truth is not the truth at all. In The Absolute, there is no negation, all opposites are unified.
*** Saints Spinoza's, Aristotle's, and Plato's Gods
** Most of the things we think about are contradictory in some way. Consciousness becomes aware of these contradictions and tries to do away with the old idea and creates a new one that negates it, but of course this new idea has its own contradictions. But organically synthesising both the original idea and its negation, all contradictions disappear (supposedly), and true knowledge is arrived at (because truth is non-contradictory). Sublation or synthesis.
** However, as soon as we apprehend truth, we have changed it, and we must try and reach it again through the same process. In this way, consciousness is an ongoing process.


* Hegel’s account avoids falling into a careless historicism by virtue of its appeal to the infinite ends at work in subjectivity, but it maintains its strong historicist commitment by virtue of the way in which Hegel takes himself to have shown that the universal has to particularize itself— a thesis we could formulate rather abstractly as the notion that for speculative (philosophical) concepts, meaning is determined by use but not exhausted by use, such that within a certain historical development, such concepts can be developed into better actualizations. Hegel’s type of philosophical history is not an a priori theory about how those historical particulars were necessitated to line up with each other, nor is it some happy talk Whig account of progress, nor is it a self-congratulatory tale of progressive enlightenment and error-correction, nor is it the explication of any laws of history or any claims about how various regimes inevitably converge at some final point or inevitably lead to a certain result.
** It is rather an examination of the metaphysical contours of subjectivity and how the self interpreting, self-developing collective human enterprise has moved from one such shape to another in terms of deeper logic of sense-making and how that meant that subjectivity itself had reshaped itself over the course of history. It is not a thesis about what constitutes true causality in history, nor is it even a thesis that unintelligibility causes such breakdowns. Hegel’s philosophy of history is concerned with what various things mean to subjects, individually and collectively, in the historical configurations into which they are thrown.

* A particular token object is neither fully instantiated in one individual of its type, nor does an individual token of the type itself instantiate its own full reality as an individual in one single moment in the present. A token must obtain beyond the immediate present moment, and it can only be captured in the now by our knowledge of it as a concept, an ideal entity penetrating beyond immediate appearance into the past, present, and future as a unified whole. To be an individual token is to be this unity of necessary aspects of that type, the full essential possibilities of the individual within its universal. What materially exists before us at any moment is just that: a momentary part of what the type's essence truly is. It is this excess beyond the present that is ideal, immaterial, and only apparent to thinking minds. 

* For Hegel the ‘ideal’, however, is not a term which merely denotes those immaterial things in our minds, but is a structure. As a structure, Hegel can thus confidently assert there is not a single thing which is not ideal, for even immediate material presence is so.

So the way I explain Hegel to my wife is I tell her that this book (The Phenomenology of Spirit) contains all of human knowledge and history. However, all of human knowledge is crammed into this book using metaphors, abstract concepts, and vague allusions, so you have to have "all of human knowledge and history" (at least up to 1806) to get what he's talking about.

This is somewhat of an exaggeration (or maybe it does contain all of human knowledge, I don't know), but it's basically how I think about the Phenomenology of Spirit. It's an attempt to put the "shape" of everything that has happened in philosophy, history, and science into a connected and necessary order where we can see the inner necessity of human thought. However, Hegel doesn't do this externally, by mentioning specific thinkers, but redevelops the shape of this thinking in a completely different manner than thought spills itself out in time. So instead of starting with, say, the Presocratics, Hegel starts with a position that says only what I see now is true, moves from here to a position that takes what it sees to be true, then to a position that thinks that only scientific laws are true, each time paying attention to the basic conceptual structure of the philosophical positions of this type that have been articulated.

At the same time, "negating" each of these positions also preserves their content. By negating the position (for example) that only what we see now is true (called sense-certainty), we learn the truth about the things that we see now. For Hegel, the key dialectical movement isn't thesis-antithesis-synthesis (this is nowhere to be found in Hegel), but the negation of the negation, that is: once you negate something twice, it goes back to being positive. This is the engine of movement for Hegel. He calls it the aufheben (sublation), which means "to negate, preserve, and elevate." So in the double negation, something is negated (usually by pointing out its differences), then these differences are negated again, yet by doing this, thinking passes through these differences, taking them into account.

To take a basic phenomenological example, we might say that a cup is "one thing," yet the cup also has a shape, a color, different parts, and multiple properties, so we negate this "one," pointing out the differences. Yet the cup isn't these differences, but remains one thing, but as a unity of these differences, so we negate our earlier negation, and return to our claim that the cup is "one thing," but with more information than we had when we started. This is the basic Hegelian move.

Sometimes, Hegel compares the movement of the Phenomenology of Spirit to the process of life (a process that, being part of human knowledge, is of course part of this book). In life, there's a restless movement from life to death, yet death always happens in the shadow of new life. Life begets life. This same kind of movement happens in the Phenomenology, only unlike the random movement of life, the book has a necessary movement. So one stage of thought dies, but brings about the new system in its wake. Or as Hegel himself describes it:

The True is thus the Bacchanalian revel in which no member is not drunk; yet because each member collapses as soon as he drops out, the revel is just as much transparent and simple repose.

So truth is a never ending party where every time someone passes out drunk, a new drunk person takes their place.

So the reason no one can explain Hegel simply and succinctly is because he tries to think the entire history of philosophy as an inner connected whole. The only way to explain how this works is to show it.

Part of Hegel's significance is in who he influenced/who needed to respond to him. Marx is undeniably important, beyond philosophy even, and he was responding partly to Hegel (as everyone says, he "turned Hegel on his head"). For people like Nietzsche or Kierkegaard, Hegel was the apotheosis of the system-building obsession of the German Idealists that Kant had inaugurated.

You bring up one very important point in Hegel - the "evolution of ideas." He wasn't the first to suggest this, but he did make it the cornerstone of his philosophy: if you want to explain something, or get the Truth of something, you have to tell its history. The significance of the dialectic (the dreaded thesis-antithesis-synthesis, which, by the way, were not Hegel's terms, and are actually kind of misleading) is in how it gives Hegel a way of honoring and maintaining the truth of seemingly contradictory propositions.

Remember that Hegel was doing a phenomenology. He was attempting to explain our phenomenal experience. And our experience is often one of flux, of change, of dynamism, of process, progress, development. Like he says in the beginning of the Phenomenology of Spirit, we find that our truths always go stale. Trying to define "Now," for instance, is a difficult, painful process. As soon as you say "now," it is already not-now. Experience keeps running ahead on us. Things that we thought were steady and stable keep on changing. Our own lives play this out - who I was 5 years ago has, in a way, died. And who I am now will similarly die, as a new phase of my life takes place.

Something like this plays out at a grander, historical level, too. A reigning "idea" gives way to its other - like the move from the Persian empire wherein only the Emperor is free to Athens where "everyone" (male citizens, that is) is free. These opposites are then reconciled (not the best word here) into the Roman republic. Or, think of American decades: the uptight 50s are followed by the free-love 60s, and then the 70s are, in some ways, a kind of synthesis of the two, simultaneously dialing back the excess of the 60s while reimplementing more of the control and order of the 50s. These are broad strokes - but this is precisely the way Hegel paints, at least historically.

You'll notice that this idea is very compatible with some understandings of evolution, and is, thus, a very typically 19th century idea.

I should also add that Hegel was extremely influential on French thought in the 20th century. We can see how Hegel's idea of the Truth always being in process (arising from the dialectical back and forth, the logic of self-sundering and return from otherness) bears comparison to Derrida's notion of différance, the differing-deferring nature of truth. For Hegel, of course, the genesis of Truth does end. And there is no remainder (meaning, every step of the dialectic matters, and is, in a way, true). For Derrida, this "genesis* is really not a genesis, because it has no goal, no-thing is being generated. You could read Derrida here as pointing out that Hegel's "narrative" is, as you say, too "direct", too ideal, too good to be true. In reality things are much messier. This is where a lot of people differ with Hegel - Peirce, Emerson, Merleau-Ponty, Heidegger, Sartre, Foucault etc. (I'm kind of cherry-picking names here) - The relentless motion of the phenomenology seems to be correct for these thinkers, but it's telos is what is suspect. Furthermore, this idea of truth as a "relationship of harmony or coherence," as quoted in your question, is deeply influential for thinkers in Hegel's wake, except that many of the post-Hegelians will doubt that there is only one ultimate coherence that makes Truth.

Does that mean that they're denying an absolute truth in general? Or merely placing the idea of one truth outside of possibility of human experience.

If there is not one final coherence for Truth, if something gets left out of the dialectic, then you have the possibility of a competing "narrative" that would fold in this left-out truth. Likely, that fold-in would be at the expense of something else getting pushed out. So is there an absolute truth in the sense of there being some final, over-arching, all-explaining truth? No. But the possibility for a really good, strong truth still remains. And, if truth arises from process, then perhaps the truth we have is a truth that is an ever developing approximation of the absolute? Imagine a function approaching its asymptote, 1/n for example. As n approaches infinity, our graph will get closer and closer to zero without ever reaching it. The genesis of truth need not be so clean, of course. Is it outside the possibility of human experience? That is a question that can't really be addressed in a general way - different thinkers would have a different take on that. Someone like Peirce, for instance, might agree only insofar as truth is never finished, its process is never complete. Someone like Merleau-Ponty might say that it is outside our experience insofar as our experience is always limited (by a point-of-view, our body-schema, our temporality, etc...), but that in a way it is present in our experience insofar as it is the ground of possibility for our perceiving/experiencing (the flesh of the world).

What exactly is the religious significance of hegel?

I can't speak to this, sorry.

Did he have an influence on process philosophy?

Yes and no. /u/wokeupabug
 put this very nicely:

[I]t's the factors immanent to a given state that produce development, and development exhibits a goal-like nature due to the logic of this process, rather than due to something outside this process directing it.

Hegel is certainly important for emphasizing the genetic over the static. His process is self-motivating in that each moment produces its other (its antithesis, if you prefer). That is not being directed from some outside force, it really is "immanent." But, Hegel says it ends. We get to the end, Absolute Spirit recognizing itself as itself. This end-point does not nullify everything that came before - on the contrary, all that stuff had to happen - but it does feel to me, anyways, like we have arrived at a new Truth that is no longer generative. Truth has stabilized. This would be at odds with Process philosophy, where process/genesis is taken to be metaphysically prior to stasis.

My understanding is that Hegel advocates a particular form of using the mind as an abstract computer. By creating and using mental software which conforms to the way things actually are, we create a hand-in-glove effect with reality and come to perceive our thoughts as more solid, true, and reliable. Associated with this may be actual mental powers which offer some verification of this solidity, such as increased facility with logic and an acute sense of its tangibility, access to unconscious contents or direct environmental insights (the brain computing the environment), or transcendent visions of the nature of categorical thought as-such.

However, on the other hand, this perspective can look like a very intentional egomania to someone on the outside of it. Actively believing and constructing a match between one's mental constructs and the Outside, under the assumption that there is such a match, is theoretically dangerous. At its most successful, this endeavor may end up doing away with, precisely, both volition and the Good. Interestingly, this seems like precisely the turn that Nick Land has been accused of taking after his early writings—but at the limit, both Hegelianism and anti- or trans-Hegelianism converge as Mad Black Deleuzianism—which could be construed as a more honest, more embodied Hegelianism.

The need Hegelians have for involving others in their world-of-thought is made necessary by their fusion of their Self with their mind and their concept hierarchy as one identity-thing, and with this fusion comes naturally a belief in the objective nature of thought as such. Therefore, the thoughts that others express will always have theoretical implications for a Hegelian, possibly problematizing ones—and yet, the source of those thoughts must (as always) be identified with the One Mind (as it's called in alchemy) and the necessary unfolding of the dialectical process—so where do they come from? It seems that Hegelianism is, psychoanalytically, a little bit messy, in that the relation between Self, others, and the World are not fully worked-out and differentiated—instead, the cognitive fusion and the dialectical process stand-in for development of the individual human soul as such, obviating any space for a more human touch in responding to the experience of life. Perhaps this is not what Hegel thought, but I think this is what "Hegelians" could perhaps be accused of by Deleuzians.

Deleuzians, on the other hand, see that the match between our cognition and reality is constructed, and our experience produced—in part—by that actively constr. So the field of play is much larger, because it's not a matter of trying to assimilate and excavate some "One True Theory of Mind", rather there are many things a mind can do, and how can we configure our mind differently so we could do these different things? A mind can also do a becoming, which is itself perhaps the most realest thing of all. But a becoming might not fit in a category very well, because it is a process and an evolving assemblage made of heterogeneous parts. Its "essence" or any teleological purpose it might have do not merely come from its inner structural logic, but much more so from its messiness, its overwhelming complexity, its situatedness within situations and environments, its momentary configuration at this point in time, its "vibe" emerging from the all these complex interactions of these factors, and so on. To say this is all proceeding according to necessity or inner structural dialectical logic is one interesting thing to say, but it also reduces the vast complexity of unfolding living experience to a mere assumption of ideal unity. We cannot exactly collect evidence to support that this is the case—as a theory or worldview, Hegelianism, like Deleuzianism, is just one way of interepreting a large collection of observable facts.

A reality that determines itself. Inner-freedom generates a fuller kind of reality, divine, spirit, soul, god, etc. Plato and Hegel show that God is deeply familiar to us in part, through our everyday experience of seeking to know and partake of [[The Good]]. This experience is what we call soul. 

Sense experience is not the last word. Human freedom, the modeling of our perceptions, identities of ourselves and the world around us, [[The Good]], just is crucial. Even Kant knew it. Hegel is trying to close the gap between practical and ideal with the ultimately ideal. 

Hegel doesn't preach the forms, but that doesn't prevent him from being a student of Plato. They seek certainty, idealism, the reality of the soul and divine, [[The Good]], that these things are all a thought. These ideal realities are the most real because they contrast with physical reality and everything else because it is more self-determining.

Resolving conflicting positions or extracting truth from it. The relationship between finite and infinite phenomena must be clarified. How can the infinite be accessible to us? It is paradoxical. What is God if it is not a being? God is the process of self determination, the reality of self-detmination, in everything. To the extent that we succeed in being self-determining, in being free, in being ourselves, we are going beyond the finite and participating in God, contributing to God, or instantiating God. Hegel may be pantheist, but the emphasis on pursuing the infinite and not being limited by other things, may be otherwise. 

Things fail to be as real as possible (sounds scholastic). Something that makes itself what it is "fully" real in a way things that are made by other things isn't. A thing that makes itself is "more real" because it is more itself because it is made of and by itself. 

Self-determination isn't merely cognitive/intellectual/logical, but also emotional (Hegel inherits this from Plato, philosopher of love). If you love, you want to share [[The Good]]. Hegel takes the inseparability of freedom and love for granted. In each other, we are involved in each other. Individuality is inseparability from sharing? What might sound highly intellectual, it is quite emotional as well. 

Self-imposed punishments.

<<footnotes "st" "For surely, we dare not trust Leo Strauss' interpretation of Saint Hegel at face value either.">>

<<footnotes "s" "Further, he says in //On the Basis of Morality//, 'I were to say that the so-called philosophy of this fellow Hegel is a colossal piece of mystification which will yet provide posterity with an inexhaustible theme for laughter at our times, that it is a pseudo-philosophy paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking, and, by the most outrageous misuse of language, putting in its place the hollowest, most senseless, thoughtless, and, as is confirmed by its success, most stupefying verbiage, I should be quite right.' He also says in his own //Essays of Schopenhauer//: “May Hegel's philosophy of absolute nonsense - three-fourths cash and one-fourth crazy fancies - continue to pass for unfathomable wisdom without anyone suggesting as an appropriate motto for his writings Shakespeare's words: 'Such stuff as madmen tongue and brain not,' or, as an emblematical vignette, the cuttle-fish with its ink-bag, creating a cloud of darkness around it to prevent people from seeing what it is, with the device: mea caligine tutus. - May each day bring us, as hitherto, new systems adapted for University purposes, entirely made up of words and phrases and in a learned jargon besides, which allows people to talk whole days without saying anything; and may these delights never be disturbed by the Arabian proverb: 'I hear the clappering of the mill, but I see no flour. - For all this is in accordance with the age and must have its course.”">>
